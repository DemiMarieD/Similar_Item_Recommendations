         "With Lon Chaney portraying The Mummy for the last time, and with no name actors for support, \"The Mummy's Curse\" is the least noteworthy of the Mummy sequels, but you know what - it's a blast! Let's start with the chronology; originally \"The Mummy\" starring Boris Karloff was set in 1932, the year of it's release, reinforced by the second expedition to Egypt by the Whemple's at which time they discovered the tomb of Anck-Es-En-Amon, Imhoteps' lost love of 3700 years prior. The first sequel, \"The Mummy's Hand\" is also chronologically coherent, set in 1940. But then it gets interesting; \"The Mummy's Tomb\" takes place some thirty years following the events of \"Hand\", with \"The Mummy's Ghost\" somewhat after. Now we learn that \"The Mummy's Curse\" occurs an additional twenty five years after \"Ghost\". If you're doing the math, we're now into 1995! Now we're into the locale; \"Ghost\" ended with Kharis and Ananka lost in a Massachusetts swamp, Ananka's beauty having withered into an ages old hag before the waters of the swamp claimed the two lovebirds. Now we've shifted to the Louisiana bayou country and the site of an industrial project - \"The devil's on the loose and he's dancin' with the mummy!\" We're signaled to the emergence of the Kharis legend by the first appearance of a dead body, but has anyone noticed that the laborer Antoine died with a knife in his back? Kharis always did his dirty work with his left hand, leaving bandage mold behind on the neck of his victims. I must say though, the resurrection of Princess Ananka was inspired and a classic piece of work, as she slowly and gradually crawls out of the dirt of the swamp, her twenty five year old mud pack having worked wonders for her complexion - and all without benefit of a tana leaf brew! Speaking of which, the tana leaf legacy gets a slight reworking in this film as well, it takes three leaves to keep Kharis' heart beating and nine to give him life and movement. As Ananka, Virginia Christine is a quick study, note that in all the Mummy films, none of the victims ever figured it out like Ananka - RUN AWAY FROM THE MONSTER! Hey, how great would it have been though, when Dr. Halsey (Dennis Moore) and Betty Walsh (Kay Harding), discover the collapsed Ananka on the side of a swamp road(?) and the creature not far behind in pursuit, if The Mummy had actually overcome the scientist, picked up Ananka and drove away in the car? It would not have been any zanier than the actual outcome. Finally, is it possible that Egyptian high priests just have no self discipline? George Zucco's Andoheb, Turhan Bey's Mehemet, John Carradine's Yousef, and now Martin Kosleck's Ragheb falls under the spell of a pretty woman, all breaking their vows to deliver Kharis and Ananka to their final resting place. Eventually, Lon Chaney's Kharis creates his own undoing, destroying the monastery where Ananka's sarcophagus is held, with the rubble of the building crashing down on top of him. But it was with a sense of \"It's not too late to do this at least one more time\" that I viewed the ending, Kharis has gotten out of a lot tougher scrapes than this one. If you can't tell by now, my sarcasm for the Mummy series is done tongue in cheek, because the films are a blast and a sheer joy for lovers of old classic horror. While the original \"Mummy\" deserves it's place in the Universal pantheon of terrific characters along with Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman, the sequel Mummy's are best enjoyed on a somewhat different level, one that requires a stronger disengagement from reality and definitely allowing a chuckle or two.",
         "This entry in the \"Mummy series\" is unlike all the others, but that's what makes it interesting! One of THE most interesting sequences in this film is when the Princess awakens in the bog (due to the sunlight), and slowly rises to her feet, totally covered with mud, and staggers to town. A very dramatic scene!",
         "There is still life in this curse, barely. The premise has ran its course. Too many familiar scenes and the thrill is just hanging on. This although is still creepy to watch and fun for a rainy night. The living mummy Kharis(Lon Chaney Jr)now seeks his lost love(Virginia Christine) in the bayous of Louisiana. Also notable are Kurt Katch and Jackie Lou Harding. A \"mummy\" fan's must.",
         "\"The Mummy's Curse\" was the fifth and final installment of Universal's mummy series and the third to star Lon Chaney as Kharis. At the close of the previous film, \"The Mummy's Ghost\" Kharis and the reincarnated Princess Ananka are seen descending into a swamp located in New England. As this film opens we find out that they have magically been transported to the Louisiana bayous. Anyway, it seems that a certain swamp is about to be drained and the locals fear that the ancient mummy will be dredged up. As luck would have it, he is. Dr. James Halsey (Dennis Moore) along with colleague Dr. Ilzer Zandaab (Peter Coe) have come to the area to recover the two mummies for a museum. Dr. Zandaab turns out to be the latest in along line of Egyptian High Priests charged with returning Kharis and Ananka to Egypt. Zandaab along with assistant Raghab (Martin Kosleck) revives Kharis (Chaney) in an old abandoned church and instructs him to find the Princess Ananka and to kill anyone who gets in his way. This he does. Meanwhile Ananka (Virginia Christine) climbs out of the bayou and wanders aimlessly through the countryside. She is befriended and taken in by the locals. Eventually Kharis finds her and takes her back to Zantaab and....... The film features a flashback sequence lifted in tact from \"The Mummy's Hand\" (1940) which itself was largely made up from footage taken from \"The Mummy\" (1932). In this sequence we see Tom Tyler as the unbandaged Kharis. The slim and muscular Tyler bore little resemblance to the heavier Chaney. Watch for two veterans of the silent screen, William Farnum and Charlie Stevens in minor roles. The Mummy was resurrected briefly for 1955's \"Abbott & Costello Meet The Mummy\".",
         "This may be the most repetitious of all the Kharis films and it's kind of gratifying that Universal finally stopped the cookie cutter after this last entry. It's by no means unenjoyable, but by now there's a severe case of \"been here, done that\" festering about and there isn't much new to help us along. Lon Chaney merely goes through the motions and gives the most listless of his three mummy performances. Peter Coe takes the award as the worst high priest, but Martin Kosleck is a good choice as his treacherous assistant even though he isn't given enough to do. The script is little more than a plodding chase which has the clumsy Kharis always coming within inches of seizing his beloved princess, only to narrowly miss her time and time again as she manages to ecape from his grasp. Redeeming qualities are found in the switching of locations to the Louisiana bayou territory, as well as Virginia Christine's appearance as the reincarnated Princess Ananka. Her resurrection sequence from a muddy swamp is not only the high spot of the picture, but it's one of the best in the entire saga. By the way, what's interesting is that if you recognized from a hotel receipt that THE MUMMY'S HAND took place in 1940, and then added up the \"30 years\" later of THE MUMMY'S TOMB & THE MUMMY'S GHOST, and top it off with the \"25 years later\" of THE MUMMY'S CURSE, you'd see that this entry would take place in 1995! ** out of ****",
         "Workers on an irrigation project in a Louisiana swamp surprisingly awaken the mummy Kharis and his princess Ananka in this final installment of the original Universal Mummy series. I say surprisingly awaken because Kharis and Ananka sank into a Massachusetts swamp at the end of the previous film. Oh well. That's okay. The change of location actually breathes a little life into the film. Granted, although the original Karloff \"Mummy\" was an all-time Universal classic, this series of sequels were B-movies at best. The most interesting thing is that I felt the sequels got more interesting as they continued, mainly in regard to the role of women. Women are always saved in old school studio horror pictures, but the Mummy, unlike his monstrous peers like King Kong, managed to snag the girl in the last picture. Once again, Ananka also provides the most interest here. Ananka's resurrection in the swamp is perhaps the best, and creepiest, scene in the film, but her fate is once again out of character for the times. Once Ananka is found by our heroes, she is assigned the traditional Hollywood role of woman in jeopardy. However, once again, that role doesn't afford much protection. The guys don't seem to mind very much when she ends up dead at the end!",
         "You know what you are in for in an early scene when Kharis' coffin slowly opens and you see a 3000 year old sarcophagus has modern hinges on the lid. Also, Peter Coe as the fanatically devoted priest of Karnak says \"mummy cases\" when he should have said \"sarcophagus\". Oh well. Will someone, anyone, please tell me how Kharis could sink into a swamp in Massachusetts at the end of THE MUMMY'S GHOST and be dredged out of a Louisiana bayou in this film? Also, this movie takes place in 1969. THE MUMMY'S HAND was set in 1912; THE MUMMY'S TOMB (the best of the lot) was set 30 years later and ended with the hero being drafted into WW2; THE MUMMY'S GHOST took place only a short time later and this film is set \"25 years later\" which would make it 1969 at least! At least after so mush frustration Kharis finally reclaims his lost love (Virginia Christine). Hopefully they can . . .er . . .\"live\" happily ever after. Performances are good but Martin Kosleck steals the show as Ragheb, the acolyte who betrays his trust when he falls in love (or at least in lust) with the pretty heroine. Lon Chaney hated Kharis as much as he loved The Wolfman and pretty much just wanders through this role. he had to have known he was cast for his name value and that anyone could have been inside the gauze. Watch for 2 silent film performers in cameo roles. William Farnum, best remembered for the 1914 version of THE SPOILERS as the keeper of the monastery the Egyptian priests have \"defiled\" by bringing their equipment there. Also on hand is Charlie Stevens, real life grandson of the Indian warrior Geronimo, as a workman named Achilles. Stevens had appeared with Douglas Fairbanks in ROBIN HOOD (1922), THE BLACK PIRATE (1926) among others and was Injun Joe in the first talkie version of HUCKLEBERRY FINN (1930). On the minus side there is some embarrassing racial humour involving a black worker named Goobie (Napoleon Simpson). Trust me, he ain't no Mantan Moreland! Personally I think all the Mummy movies are fun, but it was wise of them to end the series with this one.",
         "MORD39 RATING: ** out of **** This fourth and final Mummy film to feature Kharis is the best example of milking a formula to death. It's good enough, but Lon Chaney hated playing the mummy and it shows more here than in the other outings. He sulks through the film with no impact, presumably only interested in a paycheck. There is a dynamite scene featuring the resurrection of Kharis' princess, but that highlight is overshadowed by routine and familiar situations. It's also dull to see the mummy constantly coming within seconds of grabbing his girl, only to lose her again and again and again during the prolonged chase in this feature. It's interesting to note that this film by all rights would be taking place in 1995!!! THE MUMMY'S HAND took place in 1940; THE MUMMY'S TOMB and MUMMY'S GHOST both took place 30 years after, which would be 1970; THE MUMMY'S CURSE occurs still 25 (!!) years after THAT (1995?) You could do a lot worse than watching this movie, but it's really too much of a good thing in the long run.",
         "By this time the Kharis series was out of ideas. In the last movie Kharis & his princess submerged into a new england swamp. As usual with the Universal programmers that was ignored and we are shifted to Louisiana.Once again Kharis wants to be reunited with his loved one.AGAIN! The acting is decent while Kosleck gives a very slimy performance as a perverted Kharis follower.Chaney isn't given much except to stumble around and do some one armed strangling.The sets are nicely done as well. The scene where the princess breaks out of the ground is excellent. The characters are cardboard and there is some offensive racial stereotyping typical of the 40's.What I want to know is why don't folks run from Kharis? He moves like a tortoise. Dance around the walking ragpile, grab a torch and roast marshmellows with him.He's thousands of years old! He'll go up in a heartbeat. This movie doesn't require or deserve a lot of thought.It clocks in at 59 minutes so if you have an hour to kill it won't hurt you.Average.",
         "The Mummy's Curse (1944) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Twenty-plus years after the events in the previous film, another high priest enters the Louisiana swamps to bring Kharis (Lon Chaney, Jr.) back from the dead. This time out Princess Ananka (Virginia Christine) comes back to life but can't fully remember why she knows so much about Kharis. Soon the mummy is trying to track her down and is willing to kill anyone who stands in his way. THE MUMMY'S CURSE would be the last of the Universal mummy movies until Abbott and Costello would bring him back towards the end of their careers. I think the film is an improvement over the previous entry and thankfully the movie runs at an extremely fast-pace and manages to provide several good moments. There are several fun moments throughout but one of the highlights has to be the Louisiana setting. I thought the swamp setting added a lot of atmosphere to the picture and there's no question that it help the entertainment value. Another great scene happens early on when the priest and his servant brings the mummy back to life. Chaney probably gives his best performance of his three mummy roles here, although that might not be saying too much since he's pretty limited as to what he can actually do. Instead of just stumbling around, at least this time out he appears to be into what he's doing. Peter Coe makes for a good lead and Chrstine certainly fits her role nicely. Another plus is the make-up from Jack Pearce who manages to make the mummy look a lot better than the previous two films. THE MUMMY'S CURSE certainly doesn't have a great story or anything but there are still many good moments that make it worth seeking out. The most famous scene happens to be the one where Princess Ananka rises from her grave and it's still quite chilling to watch after all these years."
