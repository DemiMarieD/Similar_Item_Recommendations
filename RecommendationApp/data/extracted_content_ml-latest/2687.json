      "synopsis": "Lightning flashes as a young woman and her infant son are lowered from a burning ship in a small rowboat. Her husband barely manages to escape the flaming ruins of the sinking vessel and reunites with her in the rowboat. As the storm continues, they turn warily towards the dark shadow of land on the horizon. On the mainland, in the jungles of Africa, a family of gorillas is settling down for the night. Young mother Kala Glenn Close and her mate Kerchak Lance Henriksen, the leader of the clan, rest with their baby. The human family makes it to shore by morning and scope out their surroundings before deciding to build a new life for themselves. They construct a tree house using material from the wreckage while Kerchak and Kala play happily with their baby. Everything seems right until one night, while Kala and Kerchak are sleeping, their baby strays from the nest, chasing a butterfly. The leopard, Sabor, on its nightly prowl, comes upon the baby gorilla which cries out before being swept away. Kala and Kerchak run to the rescue, but arrive too late. Kala, grief-stricken, stays at the rear of the clan as they move to new nesting grounds the next morning. Suddenly, she hears a crying sound and runs through the jungle towards the source. She soon comes upon the tree house the human family had built and cautiously enters the dwelling. The place is in shambles; wind blows through a broken window and a spent shotgun lies on the floor. Kala notices shapes in the corner of the room and sees the outlines of two bodies against the wall. Bloody paw prints are scratched into the floor. Startled, she backs up onto a picture frame showing the faces of the family, including the baby. The cry starts up again and Kala finds the human baby still lying in his crib. They investigate each other for a moment and Kala is overcome with maternal instinct, deciding to adopt the baby. Before she can leave, Sabor, who had been hiding in the rafters, attacks. Kala manages to escape by jumping into the rowboat hanging outside the tree house, leaving Sabor tangled in the mess of ropes. Kala returns to the gorilla clan and shows her new baby to the other females, who react with confusion. Kerchak is not keen on the idea of Kala keeping a baby that is not of their kind and demands that she take it back. On Kala's fierce insistence, however, he allows her to keep the baby as long as it was alone but refuses to acknowledge it as his son. A young gorilla named Terk Rosie O'Donnell takes a liking to the baby, though she doesn't quite agree with his new name, Tarzan. Tarzan Alex D. Linz grows into a strong young boy with a penchant for mimicking animal noises, though he has a hard time keeping up with the moving clan. His best friend Terk looks out for him and always makes sure that he stays away from the disapproving eyes of Kerchak, but her friends label Tarzan a 'hairless wonder' and refuse to play with him. Determined to prove himself, Tarzan follows Terk and her friends to a cliff side where, in an attempt to intimidate him back to the clan, Terk instructs him to retrieve an elephant hair as a way of impressing her friends. However, Tarzan takes this ruse seriously and leaps off the cliff, belly-flopping into the water below. He quickly learns to swim and heads towards a herd of bathing elephants. A young and germophobic elephant named Tantor (voiced as adult by Wayne Knight) mistakes Tarzan for a piranha, despite there being no piranhas in Africa. Tarzan manages to grab onto one of the elephants tails but incites panic on the whole herd who form a stampede and run ashore. Terks friends are chased back towards the clan and, while no one is hurt in the stampede, Kerchak is forced to rescue a baby gorilla before its trampled. An unconscious Tarzan is pulled ashore by Terk. Tantor, still believing that Tarzan is a piranha, pulls Terk away until Tarzan comes to, revealing a single elephant hair in his hand. Kerchak and the other gorillas arrive and demand to know what started the stampede. Tarzan confesses and tries apologizing to Kerchak who argues Kala's defense to give Tarzan another chance. When Kerchak angrily states that Tarzan will never become one of the clan, Tarzan runs off. Later, he angrily splashes mud onto his face, thinking that it might make him look more 'gorilla'. Kala appears and affectionately shows him that they are actually one and the same; same hands, same eyes, same heart. Filled with a renewed sense of motivation, Tarzan promises to be the best ape ever. As he grows older, he learns to gain strength and inspiration from other animals of the jungle including creating his first spear after watching a rhino scratch a tree with its horns. Now an adult, Tarzan Tony Goldwyn has become stronger and swifter, managing to travel faster than the gorilla troop by surfing through the trees. During a wrestling match with Terk, the gorilla troop is attacked by Sabor. Kerchak rises to the defense but is overpowered. Seeing this, Tarzan swings in brandishing his spear and engages Sabor in a fierce battle, eventually coming out victorious. He presents the body of Sabor to Kerchak who reacts respectfully to Tarzan. The heartfelt moment is interrupted by a loud noise which encourages the gorillas to move out but arouses Tarzan's curiosity. He soon comes upon a trio of humans consisting of Professor Porter Nigel Hawthorne, his daughter Jane Minnie Driver, and their guide Clayton Brian Blessed. Porter is on an expedition to study gorillas and becomes particularly excited when he stumbles on a nesting site; this proves his theory that gorillas are primarily social creatures that live in family groups. Jane shares his enthusiasm but Clayton remains under the impression that gorillas are wild, savage beasts. Tarzan is nearly discovered by the trigger-happy Clayton before the trio continues on its way. Jane stays behind when she comes across a baby mandrill baboon and whips out a sketchbook to draw him. The baby, taking a fancy to the drawing, steals it and runs off. Jane takes the drawing back from him which makes him cry, attracting the rest of his family, a rather large baboon troop, and they begin to chase Jane. Tarzan, watching all this from above, swings down and rescues Jane before she can fall into a chasm. Tarzan uses his acrobatic skills to navigate the tree tops and elude the baboons, but not before giving the drawing back to the baby. Tarzan brings Jane to a sheltered spot in the trees and recognizes her as someone like him. He gently holds her hand up to his and listens to her heartbeat, much to her discomfort. His ability to mimic allows him to make vocal contact and they successfully introduce each other. Then, Tarzan carries Jane and swings out of the trees towards Jane's campsite where they heard additional shots from Clayton's gun. Meanwhile Terk, a small band of gorillas, and Tantor are looking through the jungle for Tarzan. They soon come across the Porters campsite and begin playing and making music with what they find, creating a large mess in the process. Tarzan and Jane arrive and Jane realizes, as Tarzan and Terk are reunited, that he's one of them. The rest of the gorilla troop arrives at the camp, attracted by all the noise, including an angry Kerchak. He orders the troop, and Tarzan, to leave before Porter and Clayton return. Jane tells them what happened and dreamily mentions how she met Tarzan. Despite Kerchak's warning that the gorillas must avoid the humans, Tarzan is adamant about continuing to visit them and angrily asks his mother why she didn't tell him there were other creatures like him. Over a period of time he goes back to the camp where Jane and Porter teach him English and all about the human world. After a while, they ask him if he can lead them to where the gorillas are, but Tarzan refuses, remembering how Kerchak felt about the humans. Clayton appears to be the most frustrated by this news. On one return to the camp, Tarzan discovers that more men have arrived and are loading items out of camp and towards a large steamer that is anchored off shore. Jane explains that they are to go home to England and asks Tarzan to go with them. When Tarzan realizes that he won't be able to come back to the jungle, he implores Jane to stay with him. She tearfully says no and runs away. Clayton slyly proposes to Tarzan that Jane will stay longer if she could see the gorillas, so Tarzan agrees to take them. In order to lead the Porters to the gorilla troop safely, he persuades Terk and Tantor to disguise themselves as the humans and lure Kerchak away. The plan works and Tarzan leads the humans to the troop. Everything appears to go smoothly until Terk and Tantor appear suddenly with Kerchak right behind. When he sees the humans he stops in shock but attacks Clayton when he sees him pointing his gun at another gorilla. Tarzan tackles Kerchak and holds onto him while Jane and the others escape. Tarzan then releases Kerchak, nearly choking him, as the troop watches. Tarzan tries to apologize but Kerchak accuses him of betraying the family. That night, Kala approaches a confused and forlorn Tarzan and takes him to the tree house where she found him. There, Tarzan discovers his true past and finds out who his real mother and father were. Kala advises him that no matter what he decides, he must do what makes him happy. Tarzan decides to leave with Jane and the others, donning a suit that belonged to his father. Before he leaves, however, he tells Kala that no matter where he goes, she will always be his mother. Tarzan leaves with Jane, her father, and Clayton the next morning, boarding a small dinghy towards the large steamer. Once on board, however, Tarzan is greeted by fierce looking thugs who force Jane and Porter into the hull of the ship. Tarzan attempts to escape, jumping onto a smoke tower, but the smooth metal is difficult for him to hold onto and he crashes to the deck below. Clayton reveals to be more than just a jungle guide; he intends to capture the gorillas and sell them for a hefty profit. Outraged by Clayton's betrayal and his own naivety, Tarzan lets out a yell which reaches the ears of Terk and Tantor. Already angry aboutTarzan leaving, Terk is cynical to Tantor's statement that Tarzan could be in trouble. Showing a surprisingly assertive side to himself, Tantor grabs Terk and plunges into the ocean towards the steamer as Clayton and his thugs take a small boat inland. Tantor and Terk overcome the guards on the boat and release Tarzan and the others. As night falls on the gorilla family, a flare lights up the sky in red and the gorillas are overwhelmed by Clayton's gang. Many gorillas are tied up and put into cages, but Kerchak breaks through his ropes. Clayton strings him down again and claims that the silverback would be better off stuffed. Before Clayton can shoot, Tarzan lets out a loud battle cry, leading other animals of the jungle into the clearing, and frees Kerchak. Kerchak is amazed that Tarzan came back, to which Tarzan replies, \"I came home.\" Jane and Porter arrive on Tantor and even the mandrill baboons, led by the baby, enter the fray. As Tarzan and Jane release Kala from her cage, Tarzan's arm is grazed by one of Clayton's bullets. Seeing this, Kerchak rushes at Clayton but is shot. Tarzan charges angrily at Clayton but is forced to run and hide as Clayton fires multiple shots at him. They both climb into the canopy and begin to fight on the tree branches. Tarzan wrestles Clayton's gun from him and points it at him, but hesitates. Clayton laughs and taunts Tarzan to become a man and shoot him. Tarzan mimics a gunshot, startling Clayton, before smashing the gun to pieces saying, \"I'm not a man like you.\" Clayton brandishes a machete and swings it at Tarzan, forcing him to fall back. He catches onto some vines and backs into the trunk of a tree. Clayton follows but Tarzan brings down a nest of vines, entangling him. Clayton slashes blindly at the vines around him, not realizing that one is wrapping around his neck. Tarzan tries to stop him, but with one last swing, Clayton cuts the vines they were holding and they both fall. Tarzan lands safely on the ground, but Clayton is hanged. Tarzan returns to the troop to find Kerchak dying and asks for his forgiveness. Kerchak tells him that he was mistaken about Tarzan; that he had always been part of the family and must now lead them in Kerchak's stead. Kerchak then puts his hand on Tarzan's shoulder and calls him son for the first time before he dies. Tarzan then stands before the rest of the gorilla family as their new leader and leads them into the jungle. The following morning, Jane and her father say farewell to Tarzan as they leave shore in the dingy bound for the steamer. Tarzan waves goodbye from the shore but Jane is too heartbroken to return the gesture. Porter notices how sad his daughter is and encourages her to follow her heart and go back to Tarzan. Jane jumps excitedly into the water and runs into Tarzans arms, kissing him. Porter follows, telling the captain rowing the boat to say that they were never found. \"After all, people get lost in the jungle every day.\" The rest of the gorilla troop arrives on the beach, smiling as Tarzan and Jane kiss. Jane tells the gorillas, in the language taught by Tarzan, that she is staying. They all cheer and Tarzan, Jane, and Porter live happily together in the jungle.",

         "... or no, a 15, maybe. This is right up there with 'The Lion King' and 'Mulan'. I had the treat to see this last night, and through it all, even the toddlers in the theater loved it! People have said this is a breakthrough animation-wise, but story-wise, this is like mind-blowing. Tarzan himself is the first truly deep Disney male character since ... I can't think of a really deep Disney male character, except perhaps Simba from The Lion King. Tarzan has everything that makes you realize that, though he's raised by apes, he's truly human, and even his upbringing can't hide that (C'mon, if you were raised your whole life thinking you were an ape, and then suddenly find out you're really something else, wouldn't you also be disturbed?) From the first to the last scene was awesome. Tarzan and the ape Kala's backgrounds were told briefly, poignantly, and emotionfully. There's (intelligent) humor and love, which only add to the film, and there's an obvious love between Tarzan and Jane. Someone here said they're not in love, that it's obvious, but I have to strongly disagree. The scenes between them are funny and give you a feeling that there's a strong attraction (and not just because Jane's interested in studying apes). And even Jane's father, though he's a small background character, he helps the plot along, and while you'd describe him as \"dithering\", he has his own funny bone (When Jane is describing Tarzan to him by drawing a picture on a blackboard, she starts to go on about his 'wonderful eyes', and in the midst of her daydream, her father comments, \"Would you like me to give you and the blackboard some private time?\" Riot!). No, Clayton's not a Jafar or a Gaston, but he's not really the enemy here; he's just an antagonist to help along Tarzan's inner conflict. The real enemy would be Tarzan's battling against his 'true' world (the one with humans) and the one he's grown up with (the one with apes). Clayton just resembles a threat to Tarzan's ape family. In the past, villains were a direct challenge to the hero; here, he is a threat, sure, but he's not the whole movie here. I like it better this way. In real life, there's rarely a big evil soul against you, and Clayton seems like a realistic greedy, nasty guy, rather than the cliche megolamincal weirdos of most animated features. I loved Phil Collins. And while it's great hearing Ariel sing, I think background music was better for this particular movie. I couldn't see Jane or Tarzan singing; it makes the whole thing almost unrealistic. Tarzan himself was wonderful! Charismatic, emotional, outgoing, and at the same time, goofy and boyish. The scenes between him and his ape mother, Kala, were so tender. I haven't seen such wonderful emotions in live-action movies. And even Kerchak ... let me tell you something about him. Even my mom said he was real. I don't think he was too mean. He felt threatened by Tarzan's presence. It wasn't out of superiority. When Kala first shows baby Tarzan to him, Kerchak is worried about the existence of other humans in the jungle, which might endanger his family of apes. He only worries about his family, too, and I suspect that, while he keeps a stoic face over the death of his own baby ape in the beginning of the movie, he's not ready to adopt another baby (if one of your kids died, would you be so willing to adopt another right away? I know I wouldn't). The Lion King, Mulan, and Tarzan all have the same thing in common; they all show true emotion and character, unlike the basic fairy tale fluff like Cinderella and Bambi (nothing against fairy tales, but I like to see true-to-life stuff, you know?). This is a must-see. If Disney keeps this up, adults may start to change their views of animated stuff. It ain't just for lil' kids anymore! :)",
         "The true measure of a family film is to watch a child's reaction. My (normally jumpy) three-year-old sat with enraptured glee through this movie and was able to articulate the plot back to me with amazing detail. That's not a parent's rambling, its a credit to a brilliant movie. Tarzan ranks just below Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid in the list of the best of Disney's new films. Disney formula (rogue orphan, evil villain pretending to be a friend, whacky sidekick, neurotic friend and lots a snappy tunes) has never been more apparent, but it works perfectly. But the real joy of this movie is its breathtaking beauty and the message of living without prejudice. Don't expect anything new from Disney, and do not expect a detailed retelling of the original novel. But do expect to see their product refined even further and at its best since Beauty and the Beast. This is a kid's movie, but any grown-up can like it. Minnie Driver and Wayne Knight provide the best voice overs. As my six-year-old daughter told me once, \"I like movies with scary beginnings, silly middles and happy endings.\" Needless to say, she loved Tarzan. **** out of ****.",
         "As much as I admired the regeneration of the Disney animators in the eight films produced since and including THE LITTLE MERMAID, the formula got to be pretty static and predictable. I couldn't see the hoopla for BEAUTY AND THE BEAST as an Oscar nommed Best Film. It was like all the others. However, I feel that the studio's latest, TARZAN, does deserve a best film nom. Why? It's thoroughly integrated, non-formulaic, and is the first Disney animated film to have a grown man as its hero (all the others have had heroines, animals, or teenage males - Aladdin and Quasimodo - as its centers). Tarzan's issues involve an identity crisis and a social adjustment disorder and he's far more intelligent and clever than any of the human actors who have portrayed him thus far. The personalities of the leads are beautifully fleshed out - Jane is complex, funny and intelligent. Tarzan is anything but one dimensional. The score (both the songs and the background scoring) is exceptional as is the sound. The animation is amazing - especially the flying through the vines of the forest and lighting hits a new high. The gorillas are beautifully and naturally brought to life. I'm going out of my way to hype this film to everyone I know. It's a true classic - a gem.",
         "Animated Disney films always seem to be the same in hindsight. It's only when the directors get the inclination to try something bigger that the films achieve a legendary status. It's been ten years since this new Disney renaissance began with \"The Little Mermaid\", the new \"Tarzan\" represents exactly what is wrong and what is so very right with the Mouse House's approach to the animated features. During these last ten years, the studio has learned what's worked, and what doesn't. Disney always plays it safe. The \"Tarzan\" opening is very similar to the mega-successful \"The Lion King\". They compress the entire backstory into a 10 minute opening, and it works like a charm. We all have to admit that Phil Collins hasn't done anything substantial in the last ten years as well, yet his songs for this new film are spot on. They narrate the film and guide the audience perfectly through this loose adaptation of the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel. Having been weaned on poor character songs throughout the years, it's deliciously blasphemous to not have to sit through 5 or 6 god awful musical numbers that even the composers don't seem to like. It brings an unexpected freshness to this well-known material. With \"Tarzan\", Disney is taking on a character and story that has gone through countless adaptations. This animated approach seems to fit just right. By not having to rely on a physically impressive (but poorly expressive) actor, the animators have created the most believable Tarzan yet. He glides through the jungle with ease, dragging behind his the well worn knuckles of an ape-man. It's probably one of Disney's most impressive creations, even though it is one so renowned. Tony Goldwyn brings the voice of Tarzan to life with unexpected sweetness. While used sparingly, Goldwyn manages to capture the character with ease. I also enjoyed Minnie Driver's spunky voice for Jane, making her the most palatable animated heroine since Lady. Rosie O'Donnell is about as grating as you might suspect and Glenn Close is perfect as Tarzan's ape mother. It's the villain that Disney needs to work on. While watching \"Tarzan\" you can easily feel that the addition of the bad guy is superfluous. He's just there because the filmmakers think we can't go without it. They're dead wrong. The flick is filled with lush visuals (courtesy of the more prominent GCI work), grand music, and a strong story. We don't need forced conflict. The conflict within is what \"Tarzan\" is all about. The rogue brings the film down more than it should. Coming out of \"Tarzan\" I had feelings I haven't felt from a Disney production in some time. I was moved by the material, shockingly filled with emotion. I came out of the theater humming the music, not an easy thing in the years of \"Mulan\" and \"Hunchback\". I also came out impressed that Disney might be making baby steps to a new and brighter future of animated films. I look forward to it. ------------ 7",
         "Okay. They rewrote the whole legend. But Disney has an unerring way of doing that. Anyone remember Pocahontas? They even changed Cinderella, Snow White, and every other Disney Masterpiece sitting on your shelves, so why does it matter that this, too, was changed? It matters on several different levels, but the most important reason it matters is because Disney, in their positioning among the children's entertainment market, is in the unique position to actually teach these legends, these snippets of history, these morals and ethics, to the children of their audiences, rather than proffering sugar-coated, merchandized over-glorifications in exchange for the great American dollar. That having been said, this is still an entertaining introduction to the legend, but I highly suggest \"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,\" (1984), directed by Hugh Hudson. It is the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen, and a highly enjoyable adventure, which carries a PG rating and is safe for most ages to view. A lot has been said about the deep canvas effect used throughout the jungle scenes, and I must admit that I found the technique highly effective and extremely well done. I do computer graphics myself, and I was very impressed with the 3D effects throughout, including the water variants and textures used in the ship scenes, the fire effects used in the jungle, and the smoke effects from the guns used by the poachers. The textures and backgrounds were absolutely stunning, and for me, as a graphics artist, that's what I look for when I view a quality animation. Very good endeavor. It rates an 8/10 from... the Fiend :.",
         "I found this surprisingly good because not only was animation well done - which they all seem to be in the past decade - but an involving, action-packed story that was interesting start-to-finish. The action is not overdone, however. The color in here is magnificent and it looks spectacular on DVD. The film turned out to be a good combination of drama, action, comedy and romance. I would think this would be a little too frightening, however, for little kids, for those wondering about that. The only negative I had was listening to the grating voice of Rose O'Donnell. That, and her New York City, accent, is definitely not appealing. Otherwise, I have nothing but good things to say about this film.",
         "I loved \"Tarzan\"! I was afraid that Disney would cheap out on the romance but there was enough in it for me. I liked the Phil Collins drums, but wasn't crazy about his voice throughout the whole film (nor were the restless toddlers in the audience), rather than character voices singing. The animation was wonderful,incorporating computers and gels. The elephant was too much like Horton Hears A Who, but Rosie O'Donnell's voicing of the ape friend was wonderful. (originally written 7/12/1999)",
         "This is a great film, it moves right along fast, has great characters, action, voice, music is just right, great animation, you name it. Lives up to the Tarzan heritage and then some. I highly recommend this one. Definitely something to jump up and down about.",
         "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr That is the main phrase of what Tarzan uses when trouble is about to come. I did enjoy this movie, every minute of it, it was made in 1999, i think it was is the first ever tarzan movie to be made into a catoon and to be made by Disney. I you like this movie then i am pretty sure you will like Tarzan and Jane because that concludes the next part of Tarzan of what he gets up to this time in the jungle and what missions he does. I give this movie 10 out of 10 because i think it's brilliant. I hope they will make a 3rd Tarzan movie, it would be great to see Tarzan as a daddy. Who know what the future will hold, i hope there will be another movie because Tarzan is so cool.",
         "This movie draws a sense of awe throughout the entire story. Though its plot may be formulaic, it executes better than any other formulaic movie this year. This is the best animated film I have seen in the last 5 years since \"The Lion King\". The images are absolutely wonderful to look at. The music by Phil Collins is so powerful that it energizes the whole movie making you feel emotionally charged all throughout. I feel this film could have never been made in live action, since it gives a totally new perspective on what Tarzan may actually have been like, his movement, his upbringing, and most of all, his interaction with jungle family. The musical sequences by the gorillas were silly, but entertaining (it is a Disney film isn't it?). And Tarzan's movement through the jungle is so spectacular that it makes Aladdin's flying carpet escape from the lamp's abyss seem pale in comparison. Though most of Tarzan's leaping, swinging, and tree surfing seem unrealistic, we have to keep in mind that this is an animated film, and since it is Disney's, thrills will be expected. Tarzan delivers exciting thrills, fills you with awe through the entire film, without sacrificing the story and the underlying theme. This is a WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL FILM. Go see it. If you have to decide between Star Wars I and Tarzan, it's no contest... Tarzan is the film Star Wars I should have been."
