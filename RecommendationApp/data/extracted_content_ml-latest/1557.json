         "Squeeze is one of the most brilliant urban films I've ever seen that doesn't have an abduance of violence. Tyrone Burton (who was 14 at the time) gives an Oscar worthy performace as Tyson a young guy who becomes a victim of the ghetto. If you've never seen this film check it out.",
         "\"Squeeze\" presents strong characters, good writing and photography. The film setting is not unlike most urban ghettos, and the situations are true to life. The story is real and it reminds me of some young people who are smart in school, but decided to drop out for lack of interest. Each of the young males, ages 14-15, had to assume leadership roles in their families trying to support their mothers. Unfortunately, they sought the wrong avenues, finding themselves caught up in a game spinning out of control. They were forced to seek shelter in a community based program by day, and a life of crime by night. The three found themselves in a squeeze-play. Squeeze\" is thought-provoking and the theme is reoccurring in today's society, which is why I recommend people to see it.",
         "This was a really good movie! Rent it, buy it, view it! The characters are true to life, I think I've met some of them before. Geoffrey Rhue does a superb job. This is a strong beginning for this writer/director's career. Check it out",
         "I have seen many movies in my time, but not many have truly impressed me like this film. I urge everyone to view this if you haven't already. This is a powerful story of Anytown USA, and the trials and life of mis-guided youth. This film rates a 9 from xpand. Have a great day, and support independant films."
