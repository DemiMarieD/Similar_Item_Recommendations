Although they have gone together two years, they have broken up five times, only to resume the relationship. Kathy is a stable businesswoman who longs for a commitment. David, however, has held a variety of jobs. At present, he's an English teacher of new immigrants; he's also applying for a job in Vietnam. To make matters worse, while David can tell Kathy he loves her in several different languages, he can't say it in English. After a Thanksgiving dinner with Kathy's relatives (which David was supposed to cook but didn't), they have yet another argument. The result? The couple decides to part company until Christmas; each will assess the relationship for a month. Will it be possible, with help from friends and relatives, for Kathy and David to find a permanent solution to their problems? This is a slight, sweet story told in a quiet manner. There are no \"big scenes\", only lots of little, sometimes touching, conversations strung together. The script does boast some light humor, too. When David gets together with his parents expect chuckles; Mother and Dad have come to the conclusion that their son is not only flighty but gay. Also, Kathy's fellow cartoonists are the incarnation of nerdy weirdos. Even with these bursts of comedy, however, the film just doesn't have that elusive universal appeal. But, fans of romantic comedies and independent films with sophisticated dialogue will find it an enjoyable watch."],
