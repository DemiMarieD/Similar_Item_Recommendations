         "No bottom ten list would be complete without this torturously bad film. This moronic farce stars Mena Suvari, who it seems has decided to make a career out of playing characters trying to lose their virginity. Bob Hoskins and Robert Loggia play two rival porn directors who hate one another because Ronny (Loggia) stole Joey's (Hoskins) wife. Joey takes revenge by recruiting Ronny's daughter Katrina (Suvari) to lose her virginity via a cable hookup where viewers can participate in the event by wearing a special sex simulation suit. Sally Kellerman plays a sleazy, Jerry Springer type talk show host who interviews Joey and Katrina and follows the story to the end. This film fails on just about every level imaginable. The script is trash. The dialogue is imbecilic. There is no acting, just a bunch of people screaming at the top of their lungs and running around like lunatics. There isn't even any real sexual content. The entire film is like a series of Jerry Springer outtakes. This abomination has earned the bestowal of my lowest dishonor: a rating of 1/10 (a rare besmirching). Do not eat for 5 hours before attempting to watch this film.",
         "Just when you thought that throw-away movies couldn't possibly get any worse, along comes 'American Virgin'. 'Virgin' is simply a shameless piece of trash. The filmmakers know it and for that reason they changed the title of the movie from 'Live Virgin' to 'American Virgin' in order to cash in on Mena Suvari's success ('American Beauty' and 'American Pie'). I feel bad for the poor sap who'll buy this crap expecting to see something like the two aforementioned films. This movie is just downright terrible on all levels. One only has to look at the idiotic plot involving Mena Suvari as the daughter of a porn director (Robert Loggia) who agrees to lose her virginity onscreen just to spite her father. To add further insult to an already lame plot, while Suvari's character is losing her virginity, many paying customers will be participating in the event via a virtual sex machine. Hell and I haven't even got to the talk-show scene that even Jerry Springer wouldn't admire, the subplot involving Suvari's geek boyfriend, and the annoying loudmouth antics of the two porn directors. As far as disposable movies go, this one is roadkill. Rating: (2/10) or (0 stars)",
         "There is no way around the conclusion that this production was a major embarrassment to everyone associated with it and a career breaker to some. Castwise, Mena Suvari and Gabriel Mann somehow manage to maintain their dignity despite the total meltdown around them and Alexandra Wentworth actually turns in an excellent performance in one of the supporting roles. But Bob Hoskins and Robert Loggia are unbelievably awful and the rest of the cast are not much better. The concept was fairly original or at least the most extreme take on an unoriginal concept, but at the last minute it gutlessly pulls back for a lame moralistic ending. The directing, production design, and editing are all about as bad as you will find in a mainstream production. Bad enough that the movie would be a useful bad example for students in film school.",
         "In order to cash in on the overnight success of actress Mena Suvari, the producers behind this awful film changed the name from \"Live Virgin\" to \"American Virgin,\" perhaps hoping some poor schmuck out there would mistake this for the Kevin Spacey Oscar winner or the stupid but financially successful teen sex comedy. They should be ashamed of themselves for filming and releasing this at all. This celluloid nightmare contains three Oscar nominees who should have known better. Bob Hoskins and Robert Loggia are rival middle aged porn producers. Loggia stole Hoskins's wife Alexandra Wentworth, so Hoskins steals Loggia's daughter Suvari (so to speak). In order to get back at daddy, Suvari decides to lose her virginity online courtesy of Hoskins' money, and a dopey cyber suit that will let subscribers physically feel what Suvari's lover will feel. So far, so bad. I used to rebel by missing curfews, this is just plain ridiculous. Toss in the grating Sally Kellerman as a talk show host who breaks the story, and Gabriel Mann is her son and Suvari's ex-boyfriend. After a fight on the live talk show, Loggia and Hoskins are tossed in the pokey. Mann tries desperately to find Suvari to tell her he still loves her. Hoskins and Loggia are sadly not executed for their crimes, but released. They desperately try to find Suvari. The entire movie consists of actors desperately trying to find Suvari, who hides out at another porn star's house. At one point, this mommy porn star refers to her toddler as an \"occupational hazard\"...I'll stop here while you convulse with laughter...okay?...anyway, the day of the big shoot has come. Hoskins now sports a tattoo of his impotent manhood on his forehead, courtesy of Loggia and his henchman. Suvari's cyber lover is hurt in a bike accident, and Hoskins decides to sleep with her...and then the real high jinks ensue. Not since \"Star Wars\" has a film careened toward such a breathtaking conclusion, full of hope for the future and love for our fellow man...I'll stop. Esai Morales has a pointless scene as a gay film director who idolizes Loggia. Esai should have stuck around to screen this film, since they spell his first name \"Essai\" in the opening credits. Loggia and Hoskins spend the entire film yelling the F word at each other. Neither is likable, yet neither dies a horrible death either, despite my prayerful efforts. Director Marois could not frame a decent shot to save his life. I have seen better production values from the local university's broadcasting department's news show on public access. Watch for a scene where Mann gets out of a taxi, and a boom microphone's reflection is clearly visible in the cab's roof. Marois also cowrote the screenplay, perhaps trying to put a satirical screwball spin on the porn world. Too bad no one takes the porn world seriously enough to want to see it skewered by some second rate film maker who hasn't an original thought to put on the screen. Look for porn star Ron Jeremy as a cop, proving once again that all his talent is contained below his waist. \"American Virgin\" is loud, dumb, and unfunny. Suvari was one of the best things about \"American Pie,\" but here she looks embarassed. She should be. I do not recommend it. This is rated (R) and contains physical violence, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual references, and adult situations.",
         "This movie was repulsive! I don't know why any of the actors would even do something this pathetic. It really makes me sick to be honest. I have nothing really personal against the subject matter and if it had been done differently maybe it could have been funny. But the way this was done was just pathetic and dumb! Just for Mena I give it a 2 out of 10!",
         "This film features the daughter of a porn magnate with a boy friend she once trusted who appears to have strayed from the straight path of love. In a mixture of despair and retaliation she agrees to be the first star (victim?) on a new TV series which once every month will feature a virgin experiencing her first sexual liaison on camera. The film creates a parody of pornographic movie makers interested only in the audience such a program will achieve, and this is deliberately exaggerated to the point of being grossly overdrawn. Ultimately, it culminates in a pure slapstick sequence where the boy friend manages to penetrate her dressing room on the eve of the performance and convince her that he did not stray in the way she thought - she then tells the producers of the show that she is quitting, with the obvious results. The film ends after the TV connections have been severed by a sword leaving the happy couple able to consummate their liaison in relative peace. This parody of the porn industry displays promoters trying to bring their new series to screen in a very unkind light, whilst simultaneously providing some quite sharp satire. I did not feel it was as bad as some of the IMDb User Comments suggest; but the aim of the film makers appears to have been simply to create easily achieved comedy sequences - not to make a film with any social significance - and as a result much of this satire can readily be lost leaving a very cheap and tawdry residue.. Ultimately I felt the film trivialised a serious issue, aiming to succeed as a comedy rather than to achieve any recognition for dealing with an issue of real social concern. Some of it was fun to watch, but much of the rest was (fortunately) very forgettable. The subject matter could have been treated much more realistically by, for example, introducing public reactions to the proposed TV series. Newspaper reviews could have been shown which on the one hand commended the proposed new series as contributing to the new attitude towards sexual freedom, and on the other condemned the TV channel concerned for further unjustified exploitation of the difficulties young people may experience in establishing worthwhile long-term relationships. These could have been augmented by featuring letters to the editor from fictional individuals with pre-determined viewpoints. Instead we had only cartoon level reactions to very extreme behaviour exhibited by cartoon type characters, which were mostly not worth watching. My final assessment is that this film provided a classic example of a lost opportunity; and that, despite its challenging subject matter, it is unfortunately not worth more than an IMDb rating of 2 out of 10.",
         "I just viewed this movie (IMDB and YouTube have it) and I found it to be not only hilarious but entertaining. I rarely sit through a whole movie nowadays because most suck, but this movie had me laughing all the way through. They not only used class actors but also real porn stars. I don't know why the negative comments but I plan on buying this gem. My advice is watch it and judge for yourselves. Mena Suvari had a small role compared to other works she has done but I couldn't help but like the movie because of the supporting cast. There's just something about their facial expressions and reactions that seem to express the way people would react to a similar situation. The premise is, of course, not plausible but that's why it's called entertainment. P.S.- Not for immature audiences.",
         "I really thought he was above this kind of low-budget garbage. I thought he made good movies. And the same for Mena Suvari, who's been so good in everything she's done. How many of you were like me -- you saw that Hoskins and Suvari were starring in \"American Virgin,\" so you rented it, figuring it would meet a certain standard? Also, what about Esai Morales? I didn't realize that his career had fallen so far down the tubes that not only is he appearing in something like this, he's not even a star. He only has a few lines and a bit part.",
         "This is just plain a bad movie. I had hopes because of the list of stars including Robert Loggia, Sally Kellerman, Bob Hoskins and Menu Suveri but this movie never got off the ground. If this was supposed to be a slapstick comedy it missed its mark. If this was supposed to be funny, someone will have to tell me what was funny about it. The premise of the movie is that the daughter (Suvari) of a porn maker(Loggia) is going to lose her virginity live on the internet. To make it worse, the producer of this is Loggias main competitor and the ex husband of Loggia's current wife. I almost never put spoilers in my reviews but in this case I have to because I want people to know what to expect. If you expect to see Suvari nude having sex its not going to happen. She is seen in bed but nothing is shown. In fact, if you want to see her naked, there are other films out there for you to watch. Its a shame because if you wanted to make this a good movie you probably could have and used all the same actors. Just a huge waste of talent. Do yourself a favor, avoid this one at all costs.",
         "Whenever an actor or director I like passes away, I often find something somewhat obscure to watch in their honor, especially if I've seen all of their most famous output. Sometimes I dig up something really bad, though, and that's the case with American Virgin, which I watched in memory of Bob Hoskins. Robert Loggia and Hoskins star as rival pornographers. When Loggia's teenage daughter (Mena Suvari, who made this film shortly before American Pie and American Beauty) goes off to work for Hoskins, a war between the two men begins. This mostly consists of the two actors hamming it up yelling at each other. This movie, made in Europe, has no idea how to make anything funny. For a while, it's amusing in just how weird it is, and, let's face it, Loggia and Hoskins can ham it up fun, but, after a while, it gets just plain boring."
