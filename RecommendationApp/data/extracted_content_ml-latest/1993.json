In recent times, the case pertaining to the infamous Chucky doll and the dispute the Barclay family caused that started in a nationwide uproar, has come to an all time low. The board executives of Play Pals Toy Company hold a meeting to reinstate their most popular marketing product feeling that re-launching the franchise would be in the company's best interest. The CEO and President of the company, Chris Sullivan concludes the final decision will be creating progress by introducing the Good Guy doll back on store shelves. With this, he makes a final statement claiming, \"Andy Barclay's ancient history. Nobody remembers him. Nobody cares.\" With the decision being made factories in the Chicago area are refurnished, including the same factory where Chucky was destroyed in the previous installment. Chucky's remains are brought into a vat where his blood mixes in with fresh liquified plastic reincarnating his once dormant soul within the doll. In celebration, the executives unwittingly present Mr. Sullivan with a newly reconstructed Chucky as a gift for being the first one off the assembly line. Back at Mr. Sullivan's penthouse, Chucky escapes his box and spills a jar of marbles onto the floor, which Mr. Sullivan accidentally slips and falls on. When he attempts to get back up, Chucky violently whacks him in the skull with a golf club, before throwing several darts into his spine, paralyzing him. Chucky then, leaps onto his backside and strangles him with the wire of a yo yo. Once Mr. Sullivan is finished off, Chucky uses Sullivan's computer to look up the records on Andy Barclay whom he discovers after failing to cope in a series of foster homes, has been remanded to Kent Military Academy as a last resort. At the Academy, Barclay, now sixteen, is subsequently interviewed by the school's commandant, Colonel Cochran. Cochran begrudingly enrolls Barclay into the system under the pretense he will \"be a man and forget his killer doll fantasies.\" After military formation, Ronald Tyler, an eight year old juvenile cadet, visits mailing officer Sargeant Clark, inquiring about notifications from his father, an air force pilot, stationed in Japan. Sgt. Clark replies no, but attempts to cheer the disappointed boy up by requesting of him to deliver a package addressed to Barclay. Tyler accepts the errand and heads off. En route to his destination, Tyler accidentally drops the object down a stairwell causing some of the brown packaging to tear off, revealing that the package contains a Good Guy doll. Tyler clandestinely takes the package outside and into the adjoining Armory Department where he rapidly opens it up to admire the contents. Chucky angrily bursts out of the box and reprimands Tyler for commiting a federal offense, feeling the boy has thwarted his plans in possessing Barclay's soul, when he stops himself in mid-sentence and realizes that now his soul inhabits a new body, and he hasn't revealed his identity to anyone, Tyler would make the perfect candidate. Chucky befriends the boy and introduces his malevolent plot through a game called Hide the Soul which Tyler unknowingly agrees to play. Chucky's ritual is interrupted when Colonel Cochran and a fellow Major enter the department taking inventory for the upcoming, annual War Games. Disapproving of Tyler's girlish doll playing, Cochran confiscates the doll and takes it outside onto the field. Barclay and several other cadets are practicing proper rifle technique when suddenly Barclay notices Cochran and Chucky realizing the doll has returned for him once again. Barclay's beliefs are confirmed when he hears the cries of the garbage truck driver being crushed underneath the trash compactor in Chucky's crude effort to escape. Later that evening, Chucky confronts Barclay in his room where he informs him of his newest scheme to steal the soul of Tyler while planning to kill Barclay to prevent intervention. Barclay refuses to let Chucky anywhere near Tyler and ambushes the doll, bashing it's head onto the floor. Unexpectedly, Cadet Lieutenant Brett C. Shelton, a lieutenant colonel, walks into the room and confiscates Chucky. When Shelton is asleep, Barclay sneaks into his room intending to retrieve the doll. After being spooked by Chucky, who makes a quick getaway, Barclay inadvertently wakes up Shelton who rams Andy up against a wall, before realizing Chucky is missing. In order to weed out the supposed thief who Shelton believes stole the doll, Shelton forces the cadets to participate in an exercise outside in the courtyard until someone confesses to the theft. Barclay attempts to sneak out of the routine when he is apprehended by Shelton who forces him back into the activity. Meanwhile, Chucky stalks the halls of the juveniles' corridor before discovering a note Tyler left for him, misinterpreting their little rendezvous for playing a game of hide and seek. Chucky locates Tyler in Colonel Cochran's office where they proceed with their game of Hide the Soul. When they are faced with, yet another interruption this time by cadets Kristen DeSilva and Ivers. The three flee after hearing the sound of Cochran walking down the hallway. Cochran enters his office where he throws Chucky into a wastebasket. He turns around for a brief moment and discovers Chucky, who has escaped the wastebasket, brandishing a knife. The sight of the doll, triggers Colonel Cochran to go into fatal cardiac arrest. The following morning, while the cadets are recieving instruction from Sgt. Clark pertaining to the War Games. The Academy's sinister barber Sgt. Botnick finishes giving a haircut to cadet Harold Aubrey Whitehearst, Barclay's roommate. After Whitehearst leaves, Botnick finds Chucky in a cabinet and decides to give the doll a haircut. Chucky defensively slashes the man's throat with a shaving knife witnessed by Whitehearst who had returned to retrieve his jacket. After being frightened away by Chucky, Whitehearst returns to his rightful place in line where Barclay realizes he saw Chucky though Whithearst won't admit to anything. Meanwhile, Chucky enters the Armory Department where he replaces the paint bullets from the Red Team's rifles with live rounds. After instruction is finished, both teams head out in different directions with Tyler on the Red Team and DeSilva, Barclay, and Whitehearst on the Blue Team. Later that night, Barclay swipes Shelton's reconaissance map and offers for Whitehearst to tag along with him to rescue Tyler. While, Whitehearst refuses to get involved, he does agree to cover for Barclay, in case anyone questions his whereabouts. Minutes after Barclay leaves, Shelton discovers the map is missing, and after Whitehearst fails to lie to him, comes to the conclusion Barclay is betraying his team in hopes of gaining glory for exposing the Reds first. Shelton immediately orders his team to set out in hopes of stopping Barclay. Meanwhile, Barclay is discerned to find Chucky has already located Tyler and taken him. Before he can set out to search for them, Barclay is cornered by Shelton and the Blue Team. Meanwhile, Chucky and Tyler end up in a secluded section of the woods where Chucky threatens Tyler with a Bowie knife. Tyler acting in self-defense sticks Chucky in the shoulder with a pocketknife before running into Barclay and the Blue Team. Chucky radios Barclay where he informs him that he is holding DeSilva hostage and will bomb her with a grenade if Tyler isn't delivered to him effective immediately. As the Blue Team sets out, Chucky poses as a fellow Red Team cadet announcing that there is a Blue Team sighting at his location. When the Blue Team arrives, the exchange between Tyler and DeSilva is successful when the Red Team descend upon the area and begin firing randomly. Shelton is shot and killed amidst the crossfire when the Red Team cease fire realizing they are using live ammunition. Major Ellis, Shelton's lieutenant, blames Barclay of the ensuing chaos and initiates a fight with him. Tyler uses the diversion to escape down hillside to a nearby carnival. Before pursuing him, Chucky throws the grenade at the quarreling cadets. This is only witnessed by Whitehearst who bravely leaps onto the grenade, sacrificing himself to save the others. When the cadets take a moment to realize what has just occurred, Barclay and DeSilva race off after Chucky and Tyler. When they arrive at the carnival, Barclay and DeSilva discover the cadaver of a dead security officer, killed by Chucky, which DeSilva puts to good use by nabbing his spare gun. She instigates a shootout with Chucky where Chucky is successful in shooting her in the leg. Leaving Barclay to take the gun and move on. Chucky manages to invoke the voodoo ritual onto an unconscious Tyler where they sit upon a foam, skull mountain inside of a horror themed amusement ride. Barclay climbs the mountain while shooting at Chucky. He shoots Chucky's arm off and subdues him for a brief moment while Barclay tends to Tyler. He ends up accidentally dropping Tyler down the side of the mountain, holding onto him by his hand. Chucky leaps onto Barclay from behind when Tyler hands Barclay his pocketknife which Barclay uses to slice Chucky's hand off. Chucky loses grip onto Barclay where he falls into a large fan which mutilitates him into pieces. Police and ambulances emerge onto the scene with DeSilva being loaded into an ambulance and transported to a nearby hospital. While Barclay is taken off by the police for questioning.",

         "Every horror series has a black sheep. \"Friday the 13th\" had the Jason-less fifth installment, \"Halloween\" the Michael Meyers-less third entry, and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" the silly first sequel. For many fans, \"Child's Play 3\" is the embarrassment of the Chucky saga. But why? So many reviews of this film express exacerbation, even confusion, over the sudden shift eight years into the future. What's so hard to understand? We had already had two movies with Chucky chasing a little kid. It was time to move the story along, hence our hero Andy Barclay (Justin Whalin) is now a teenager at a military academy. This change of scenery was the breath of fresh air the series needed, as it opens up all kinds of new options to the murderous doll, which he fully exploits (paintball guns loaded with real ammo, anyone?). Other reviewers complain this just isn't scary. There they have a point, but how many gorefests actually bring our hands up to our eyes? Scariness is a great complement, but that doesn't mean the whole project goes down the tubes without it. \"Child's Play 3\" has a smooth storyline, a touch of suspense and a truly memorable, original climax at a carnival (though it doesn't quite surpass the doll factory finale of the the previous film). Chucky's foul mouth begins to be a liability rather than an asset, but we can cut him some slack -- he's certainly never looked better (or more realistic). \"Child's Play 3\" does have its ups and downs, however. The romance between Andy and a fellow cadet is a distraction, and there are times when our plastic star just seems brushed aside in favor of more serious moments. Chucky's desire to swap souls with someone other than Andy is a welcome change, but his new target, young Tyler, is one dimensional and uninteresting. He's unable to carry his scenes like Alex Vincent, who played child Andy in the first two films. As far as I'm concerned, this was the last of the true \"Child's Play\" films. Once this one was done, the series became a shameful, hokey parody of itself. This entry is by no means perfect and it's certainly not up the caliber of \"Child's Play 2\". Yet it's not the piece of trash so many would have us believe. In fact, it may just be one of the most underrated theatrical horror films of the early '90s.",
         "I'm going to comment hell for this one. This comment will most likely receive a very low \"useful\" rating, but I'm OK with that. This movie was quite possibly my favorite of the Child's Play series. And although you will probably not agree, you will see what I mean: This movie takes place 8 years after the previous. Andy is now a teen and has been sent to a military academy. And guess what: Chucky decided to tag along. This makes for a great story. Chucky really shows his true colors and sick, twisted sense of humor here. We also have an interesting group of characters here, who are actually worth mentioning. We have Andy of course, we have Tyler, a young cadet who catches Chucky's eye as a replacement of Andy; there's DeSilva, a tough girl who has a soft spot for Andy; we have Whitehurst, an outspoken, nerdy type who quickly befriends Andy; we have Shelton, a military-loving, tough, intimidating young man who has it in for Andy; and we have Botnik, an older guy, the barber who loves his job just a little too much. Together with these great characters is a great setting. There are some very interesting kills here which I have not even thought of or seen in any previous film. I do not understand why this movie is so underrated. Is it because of the time lapse? Maybe because Andy's not a kid? New setting? No matter what the reason, this movie deserves much more than a 4.1 rating (as of 3/7/08). I say it gets 9/10. Fans of the first 2 films will not want to miss this.",
         "Gripping drama? Hell no. Hilarious comedy? Nope. Oscar Calaber Acting? Heh... yeah right. But, really, this movie did not deserve to be slammed into the 3s. The movie had everything a mediocre early 90s horror movie should have - a plot you can follow without going cross-eyed, a few really gory death scenes and a pinch of humor. This movie won't make you roll on the ground laughing, but it will get your a chuckle here and there at Chucky's antics. The young actors also pull performances that's beyond tolerable - it's flat out acceptable. Absolutely great movie? No. Absolutely horrible movie? No. I was entertained and got exactly what I was looking for... thus it earns a 7 from me. You want a horrible horror movie that deserves its three - check out Leprachaun 4.",
         "Just when you MIGHT have thought - after watching an excruciatingly long death sequence in Child's Play 2 - that Chucky was no more - he's back(and with the cliché) with a vengeance. How is he resurrected? Well, apparently when eight years have passed the toy company reopens their Good Guy doll factory, removes the cobwebs off of all the old stock, pick the mutilated, dead Chucky doll up and pop him in a vat of boiling plastics. The springs of Lourdes never had so much healing power! This revives Chucky, and he instantly becomes his mean, killing machine of old and wants to find Andy Barclay to take his soul. Andy, played by Justin Whalin, is an older teenager now and enrolled at a military academy. Well, not to get too bogged down in a script that doesn't really merit such an intense analysis - Chucky finds Andy and continues to basically do what he did in the two earlier films. Lots of killing. Lots of wisecracks and that cackling laugh. Lots of the same. I did like this film more though than the second installment. First of all, the director did NOT repeat the problem of an overly long, seemingly never-ending death scene. The military school makes for an interesting backdrop to the story. The young actors do credible jobs. There are some interesting , quirky characterizations from the rest of the cast with Andrew Robinson stealing his scenes as a barber who really enjoys shaving the heads of the cadets. In fact I loved the little ponytails hung on the walls of his salon. A neat little addition. The story is nothing special though, and the film is very formulaic. It is entertaining if you - like me - have limited expectations.",
         "I never watched the Chucky series in sequence. I never used to like them. I saw Seed of Chucky, Child's Play, Bride of Chucky, child's Play 2 and then Child's Play 3. Seeing as though this was the last that I watched. I really was into Chucky and I thought it was a great addition to the series, yes it's a bit \"out there\" but that's what's good about Chucky. I'm not particularly into the military thing but this movie made me appreciate it that bit more. I think it is good how it shows Andy still hasn't gotten over his phsycological problems and that he is still terrified of his old best friend. I liked this one better than the original and I love the lines that Chucky says. For those who don't think it's a good movie, I understand because I didn't enjoy it the first time I watched it but now that I have seen it more I love it!!",
         "this is one of the films that u see when u are a kid n then you never forget it... u get nightmares and never forget the face of that notorious killer doll,Chucky. This is in my personal opinion the best of the Child's Play series (1,2+3... Bride of chucky was pathetic) with its more humorous approach on the whole killer doll idea as well as being the more violent and macabre hence the '18' certificate. From the funny/cool one-liners such as \"Presto... your're dead\", \"nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going\", and the one above in online summary to Chucky's violent killings and chilling laughs you know this is gotta be better than 1 and 2. the music goes alongside the most chilling scenes well such as Chucky's resurrection in the factory and scenes of death. His death scene at the end is also quite funny as he is flapping his arm and legs around before he hits the large fan and gets ripped 2 shreds! I personally regard this movie as one of my favourite films of my life (hey I'm only 14) as I watched when I was 4. I'm now looking forward 2 'Seed of Chucky'!",
         "this time around we find Andy Barclay in a Military Academy, it is 8 years later, and Chucky follows him there , where he meets a little boy named Tyler, Tyler of course falls for Chucky's sweet little innocent routine at first. he goes for the little boy i guess because he realizes that it's going to be really hard to get to an older Andy,, one of the funnier lines in this movie is when Chucky says he wants to be a \"bro\" i just thought that it was hilarious at the time,, Andrew Robinson from the original Dirty Harry plays the barber in the movie who gives all of the recruits their new haircuts,, wow he looks different,, anyways there are war games going on in the compound, and Chucky switches the paintball rounds for live ammo,, leading up to an interesting conclusion to this movie,, also look for Andy's friend De Silva a pretty young girl who andy falls for in this ,movie,, overall not a bad entry,, but not as good as the second one.",
         "Set eights years after Child's Play 2, this sequel sees Andy Barclay attending Military School and getting bullied by the drill sergeant (\"poor man's Christian Slater\" Travis Fine, who never really became as popular as he should have been). Meanwhile, the Play Pals company has reopened the Good Guy factory and is starting production of the doll once more. But when clearing away Chucky's grisly remains, some of his blood spills into a vat of molten plastic and he is born once more in a new body. After a good old strangulation to get the circulation going he locates Andy at his military school and somehow figures out a way to mail himself there. However, once the package gets there it is promptly snatched by a very annoying, morbidly juvenile, and highly wimpy little kid called Tyler who has the same face as has-been 'singer' Craig David, only more annoying (if that is even possible). Since he has a new body Chucky reveals his birth name once more, hoping to get a fast and easy ticket out of his plastic shell. As before there are too many distractions. And as before the film spends way too much time with boring humans who spend too much time lurking in the dark wondering why a doll seems to appear and reappear and not enough time with Chucky. He IS the star of the show and he should OWN this movie. Alias and Lost director Jack Bender never really gives him the chance. Which is a shame since the animatronics had improved over Child's Play 2 and Chucky was beginning to look nastily cute. And more and more like Brad Dourif if you look hard enough. Bender's direction is slick but lacks edge, invention or humor. He seems to be ignorant of the potential Chucky has and treats the film like another mechanical TV series with no spark or signature. I remember when I first watched the VHS tape as a kid I immediately noticed how darker and gloomier this movie is, which ultimately leads to an overwhelming downbeat, depressing atmosphere, that sort of does and sort of doesn't work. The score is a major downer though. Greame Revell's wonderful orchestral adventure of Child's Play 2 has been replaced with a horrid synthesized, death-metal score filled with tacky and unimaginative stingers. Revell, fortunately, returned for Bride of Chucky. Child's Play 3 is no more than a competent sequel. Writer Don Mancini said he wasn't even ready to do a 3rd movie but Universal forced him to before the second was even released. As he was out of ideas he claims this film to be his least favorite of them all. If a better director were involved it could still have been a good film instead of being a merely an above average (by a tiny, tiny bit) one.",
         "I never really liked CHILD'S PLAY. That film was a modern re-imagining of the classic possessed doll theme, which was so silly that it ended up making me laugh. Aside from one scene where Catherine Hicks checks the doll for batteries, the film failed to scare, not to mention having a few plot twists that were just plain bad. Nevertheless the film was a modest hit, which led to two sequels (which were actually better). Six years after his last confrontation with Chucky the possessed doll, Andy Barclay has been sent to a military school. At the same time, the Play Pals toy factory has restarted its manufacturing of Good Guy dolls. Chucky's soul possesses the first one built &, after killing the Play Pals' president, mails himself to the military school. Andy must now try once again to defeat Chucky before he can regain human form by possessing one of the cadets. Like I already said, the series has lost its spark, which is actually a moot point since the creativity that made the first two films was running on used petrol fumes. Child's Play 3 has the exact same plot as its predecessors, with Andy Barclay trying once again to foil Chucky's plan to regain human form by possessing a human child (although this time around, Andy is no longer the target). While the original film offered a twisted commentary on the popularity of large life-like dolls & the second delved into the life of a foster family, this third film looks into life at a military school. Thus we have scenes where Justin Whalin arrives, only to be thrust into a harsh life, being singled out for abuse by the local sociopathic cadets. As is usual with these films, it's the Chucky show. This time, the doll kills his victims in ways that would make Freddy Krueger laugh. The first scene, where the president of the toy company is attacked by remote controlled toys, slipping on some marbles & finally strangled with a yoyo string, is quite creepy at first then turns routine (how does Chucky learn computer skills?). The other kills are milked for all the dark humour they contain � Chucky crushes one victim in a garbage truck, slits the throat of the demented hairdresser & kills the school's leader by scaring him to death, saying \"You've got to be � kidding me\" as he watches the man die of a heart attack. Plus the way Chucky sabotages the war games by switching the paintball rounds of the rifles with real bullets is positively original. The acting is decent enough for these sorts of films, with Justin Whalin playing the outsider with a troubled past quite effectively. Perrey Reeves & Dean Jacobson provide adequate support while Brad Dourif (the only actor to star in all three films) is hilarious as Chucky, once again proving to be the star of the show.",
         "Surprisingly, an improvement over #2, and still, 'Child's Play 3' is too much of a waste of time. Sure, it's harmless, but it's just another excuse to beat a dead doll. Chucky's back, and again it's a preposterous reincarnation and introduction. We find him stalking little Andy (now a teen in a military reform school) again, despite part two's explanation that Chucky can't transfer his lost soul into the boy anymore. Some of the humor's there, my favorite was the Colonel's death mixed with Chucky's surprise and disappointment. Thankfully, now that Andy's grown a bit, he's played by a much better actor that has some (I said some) range. I also liked him in the 'Lois & Clark' Jimmy role (he was in 2-4, replacing the dud they hired for Jimmy in season 1.) And I admit some of the lines Chucky used was mildly funny as well as the conclusion in the seemingly never ending haunted house was appropriate for the series. Unfortunately, the whole movie was just another remake of #1-2 and the inconsistencies and plot holes were fairly large. Would they really put sharp knifes in the haunted house? Would someone seriously not report a death that just happened and go off to play a game? Yeah, I'm looking too deep. It's safe to skip #2 and #3 and return when Chucky returns in full force in 'Bride of Chucky.'"
