         "A happily married woman Faith (Lysette Anthony), has a one-night stand with Walter (handsome William R. Moses). Turns out he's a psycho and wants her to leave her husband (Patrick Cassidy). She rejects him and...guess what happens? Thoroughly predictable but not bad. The script is very well-written and all the actors give out good performances (even Cassidy whose part is criminally underwritten. Also, Wanda Acshna is fantastic as one of Faiths friends. Also the film wins extra points for keeping the violence down to a minimum. No great shakes but well done. An enjoyable time killer.",
         "This film was very good with much suspense through out. I do not understand why the movie has a 5.2 user rating. It was very entertaining and kept me at the edge of my seat. I saw this on the cable network, FX and for a Cable TV movie. this movie was better than most. It kept my attention and since I watched it late at night while laying on the couch at times and that I did not fall asleep that is quite an accomplishment. Although it is predictable and not quite in the same league as \"What Lies Beneath\", I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends and family.",
         "this movie sucks. don't waste your time or brain cells. Its like a souped up love story version of \"the shield.\" and to think i could have been studying. Each character is dry and undeveloped. Walter is creepy, but so is Faith, so their relationship would seem to make sense, but instead these horrible performers seem to destroy any trace of chemistry they might have had. The dialogue sucks, the script looks like its a first draft, and the direction... well i wasn't able to find any. This movie gets an F. but the character Richard's hair gets an A. Titanic was a better affair story than this.",
         "This movie is so empty and vacuous it's hard even to comment. \"Man...\"/\"Fiance\" falls into the suspense---you wish---psycho serial killer genre. Everything suffers from terminal malnutrition: the plot, the dialogue, the direction, the acting, the score, not to mention each of its two titles (\"The Fiance\"??? Really!). The actors are pros but have absolutely nothing to work with nor any apparent direction. The characters connect neither to each other nor to the plot, the bones of which have no meat on them and barely connect to each other. No effort is wasted on creating or building tension; when someone gets killed, it's a non-event. One minimal plus: a couple of slightly interesting outdoor locations. (Ha! Now you can leave or go back to sleep.) Pathetic!"
