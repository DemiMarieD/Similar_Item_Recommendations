         "content": "If you fall out of bed again the cockroaches are gonna start talking.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Spot is directed by Dennis Hopper and adapted to screenplay from the Charles Williams novel, \"Hell Hath No Fury\", by Nona Tyson and Charles Williams. It stars Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen, Jennifer Connelly, Charles Martin Smith and William Sadler. Music is by Jack Nitzsche and cinematography by Ueli Steiger.\r\n\r\nDennis Hopper loves film noir, he has been in some bona fide classic neo-noirs, whilst also turning his hand to directing that style of film making. The Hot Spot may not be a total success as such, but it is a superb effort that lovers of all things noir can feast upon. Story pitches Johnson as drifter Harry Madox, who lands in a Southern state town, bluffs his way into a car salesman job, plots a robbery, and then finds that two local ladies - of very different qualities - are about to change his life forever...\r\n\r\nI found my level and I'm living it.\r\n\r\nHopper turns in a honest and faithful tribute to the first wave of film noir, but armed with the fact this was his era of film making relaxations, he gets to sex things up. Blending noir with erotic thriller conventions allows Hopper to pile on plenty of sizzle, which comes in the form of Madsen, who as Dolly Harshaw gives neo-noir one of its finest femme fatales. Overtly sexual and on the surface a ditz, an easy lay, it's only when this part of noirville shows its hand - in true old school fashion - does the character become memorable still further.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side is Connelly's more straight laced Gloria Harper, who Madox coverts, yet there's baggage there as well (is she virginal?), baggage which adds more potency and trickery to this smouldering hot spot hot-pot. The girls are great, but so is Johnson, he broods and has a raw masculinity most fitting for this type of role. It's a shame he didn't do more neo-noir because he has the tools for the trade. Hopper brings sweat, sweaty close ups and noirville fans, while the photography and musical accompaniments are superbly compliant to the required atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe editing is a let down, so many scenes needed to have the linger factor, but it's not enough to kill this fine slice of noir pie. A sexy guy in over his head, devious machinations from both sexes, robbery, arson, deaths, ignorance and stupidity, The Hot Spot is far from being boring! The deliberate slow burn pacing has alienated the casual \"crime/erotic thriller\" film fan, but for those who love and know their noir, the fireplace cinders approach is a joy because the pay off delivers all that we hoped. 8/10",

         "This movie has to rate as one of the most important American films of the 90's. Dennis Hopper could be the next great American director in the 21st Century. The film was sexy without being crude. Don Johnson showed that his acting can be powerful if the right roll comes his way.Virginia Madsen steams up the show with her portral of the modern vamp.Jennifer Connelly plays it perfect with the innocent routine when she is the hottest girl in the movie. Anyone would enjoy this film on a cold night in the dead of winter with a lover on the couch next to them. A Great Watch!",
         "The audience for this film stayed away because of Don Johnson. In his defense, Johnson has been in a few very good films (Melanie, A Boy & His Dog), and he is very smooth and sleazy here. Fueled by a great sound-track, provided by John Lee Hooker, Miles Davis and Jack Nitzsche, this dirty edged noir evokes a Jim Thompson like feel, and is beautifully lit and shot. Dennis Hopper directed, and he did just fine. There is so little good noir in the last 30 plus years, that fans of the genre will want to see this. And if you get the chance to see it on the big screen, it is well worth it. In an era when no 'new noir' comes close to Polanski's Chinatown, this movie is way better than Body Heat or LA Confidential. It certainly looks better, and has a much rawer sensibility and texture.",
         "This movie has someone for everyone to like and almost everyone to hate. Between Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen, and Jennifer Connelly, there's a romantic interest for both you and your sweetie. I've never lived in the South so I'm not sure you'd like the portrayals if you are from there, but even without the Southern setting, the deviousness and deceit are universal. After the first viewing, the plot twists may not surprise you anymore, but you'll appreciate even more how justice and irony come into play in deciding the fate of the players. Highly recommended.",
         "If you are like me, you might have turned on HBO late the other night, and thought.... \"Damn, a Don Johnson movie\". Luckily I gave this film a chance and found a real winner. Don's performance is not just good, but I think it is his best ever. Jennifer Connelly is just perfect in the role of the frail and beautiful girl next door. But Virginia Madsen steals the show. She is that woman you just love to hate, but just can't keep your hands off of. Just watch the flick to see what I mean. As the credits rolled across the screen at the end, I realized that Dennis Hopper directed this \"Red Rocks West\" like film. No wonder I enjoyed it. I give it a solid 7 out of 10.",
         "This is classic southwest film noir/romance novel brought to life. Although the plot is the standard lets kill a cuckolded, rich husband (with sex!) and take off with the new handsome stranger, the heat of this film lies in its characterizations. Don Johnson is almost perfect as the handsome stranger/used car salesman/bank robber/arsonist/white knight in shining (but obviously tarnished) armor. Jennifer Connelly's understated desperation at her situation is almost exactly balanced by Virginia Madsen's almost over the top vixen/gold digger. Other characters add the perfect backdrop to the action (Charles Martin Smith's \"nose sniff\" scene is absolutely classic). The twists and turns of the plot and revelations makes this movie constantly interesting. It really doesn't get much better than this--Jennifer Connelly does a rare, for her, nude scene, as does Virginia Madsen, Don Johnson, and a bevy of strippers.",
         "i checked out this movie just due to the fact that it was written and directed by Dennis Hopper and had the beautiful Jennifer Connelly in it as well. the movie has so many twists and double crossings that going into the plot would ruin the experience. but for once, a movie kept me guessing and the twists and turns were logical for once. it seems that a lot of movies nowadays throw a ton of curveballs even if it isn't necassary (Wild Things is an example.) all of the acting is superb and Virginia Madsen is deliciously nasty and sexy but Jennifer Connelly steals the show with a great performance. ms. connelly was the perfect choice for this role in that she embodies stunning sexuality and physical perfection as well as a sweet persona that lends itself to the role perfectly. the strong doses of sex are appropriate to the plot as well. the film's only flaw is that it is easily at least 30 minutes too long. i felt the movie should have been wrapped up a lot sooner than it was and the overlength brings it from an 8 down to a 7 still, this is well worth renting for all the performances and a genuinely well told story. rating: 7",
         "Dennis Hopper delivers the goods in this meticulously conventional tale of a charismatic underachiever finding his level. Harkening back to the gender and class warfare sensibilities of the Forties, The Hot Spot excels across the board, in acting, dialogue, plotting, music, and cinematography.",
         "When the drifter Harry Madox (Don Johnson) reaches a small town in Texas, he gets a job as used car salesman with the dealer George Harshaw (Jerry Hardin) and settles down in a hotel room. During a fire, Harry observes that the local bank is left empty and open without any security. Sooner he plots a scheme to rob the bank, provoking a fire in his room to distract the employees. When Harry meets George's wife Dolly Harshaw (Virginia Madsen), the easy woman teases him and they have sex. Harry becomes the prime suspect of the bank heist and is arrested, but Dolly provided the necessary alibi to release him and blackmails him to have a love affair with her. However, Harry falls in love for Gloria Harper (Jennifer Connelly), who works as accountant in the dealership. He discovers that Gloria is blackmailed by the despicable Frank Sutton (William Sadler) and he decides to press Sutton. But in the end, Dolly gets what she wants. \"Hot Spot\" is an unknown gem and one of the most amoral stories of the cinema history. With the exception of the sweet Gloria Harper and the cuckold George Harshow, the other three lead characters have no moral or ethical codes and Virginia Madsen performs one of the most despicable and Machiavellian femme fatale of the cinema. This masterpiece of Dennis Hopper is certainly the best work of Don Johnson and the soundtrack is stunning and among my favorites. I have just watched \"Hot Spot\" maybe for the sixth or seventh time and this film-noir has not aged. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): \"Hot Spot \u0096 Um Local Muito Quente\" (\"Hot Spot \u0096 A Very Hot Spot\") Note: On 29 October 2011, I saw this film again.",
         "This film is great. The atmosphere, heat, casting, setting, plot, you name it. Everyone in the film is sweating up to the eyeballs, constantly mopping their brows, with stains all over their clothes, looking very hot and tense indeed. The seeds for a necessary release are sown! And sure enough, the pressure reaches boiling point and everything erupts. I don't want to give too much away, nor can I be bothered writing a proper commentary but this film is BLEAK in it's honesty with respect to it's (secondary/primary?) plot - all ideals are shattered: romance and (true?) love, freedom (whatever that really is) and so on. Some would call this a cynical work, I'll call it realistic - Sod's Law applies as heavily in the movie as it does in real life. Go on Dennis, more of this please!!",
         "Shot in and around Austin, Texas, brilliantly written and directed by Dennis Hopper and adapted from Thompson's book, Hell Hath No Fury, this is a movie buff's movie. It is probably the best performance by Don Thompson he will ever give. It's one of those movies that put everything together to achieve a \"harmonic\" that is very very rare. Why it didn't achieve notice and a clutch of awards is one of the mysteries of the film industry. Everything in the movie meshed perfectly, including a great score."
