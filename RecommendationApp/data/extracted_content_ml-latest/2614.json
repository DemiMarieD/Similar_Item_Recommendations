      "synopsis": "Park Plaza Mall has just installed a state-of-the-art security system, which includes security shutters across all exits, and three high-tech security robots, programmed to disable (using tasers and tranquilliser guns) and apprehend would-be thieves. Four couples (Married pair Rick and Linda, Greg and Suzie, Mike and Leslie, and Ferdy and Allison) decide to have a party in one of the furniture stores where three of them work. They all stay after hours at the mall, drinking, partying, and eventually three of the couples have sex in the furniture store beds, while the fourth couple, Alison and Ferdy, who were introduced by Greg and Suzie, watch old science fiction films on TV. Outside, a lightning storm strikes the mall several times and damages the computer controlling the security robots, which kill their technicians and a janitor, before going on regular patrol in the now empty mall. Two of the teens (Mike and Leslie) leave the furniture store to buy cigarettes, and are subsequently killed by the robots - now the \"killbots\" of the movies original title. The surviving teens witness the killbots kill Leslie, and the men and women are forced to separate, the men into the mall and the women into the air ducts, when the killbots begin their attack. The men break into a sporting goods store (\"Peckinpah's\") to arm themselves with guns, whilst the girls take gas and flares from an automotive store after Suzie has a panic attack and leaves the air ducts to help Greg, with Allison and Linda following her, not wanting to leave her in the mall alone. Utilizing a propane tank, Rick, Greg, and Ferdy blow-up and appear to destroy one of the killbots (Though it later recovers). Rick, Greg and Ferdy then rig the mall elevator with a booby trap. A second killbot ambushes the women while the men finish rigging the elevator, and Suzie's screams alert the men that the women are in trouble. They rush to help, but are too late. Suzie is killed as the killbot utilizes its laser, setting fire to her gas can and setting her aflame, while Greg watches in horror. He tries unsuccessfully to shoot the killbot, before Rick drags him away. The teens, now regrouped, are able to destroy a killbot by luring it into the booby-trapped elevator. They then hide out in the restaurant where Allison works. Greg confronts Allison and Linda about leaving the air ducts, which led to Suzie's death. Greg also exhibits signs that he's beginning to crack. The girls try to explain, but Greg has difficulty accepting their explanation, going so far as to pull his gun on Ferdy when he intercedes on Allison and Linda's behalf. Rick manages to calm him down, and Ferdy suggests destroying the main control centre for the killbots, thinking that it will shut them down. Greg and the others support the idea. They begin to make their way to level 3 of the mall where the killbots' control centre is located. Greg, continuing to behave recklessly over Suzie, and despite the others trying to get him under control, gets too far ahead of them and is killed when one of the remaining killbots ambushes him and throws him over the balcony, where he falls to his death three floors below. While on the run, the remaining teens see the killbot that was believed to be destroyed and realize there are still two left to deal with. The final four, Allison, Ferdy, Rick, and Linda take refuge in a department store as the remaining two killbots work to gain access. Hearing one of the killbots gain entrance in the store's lower level, The group sets up store dummies and mirrors in an attempt to confuse the killbot waiting outside the upper-level door, then open it up. The plan works, and when the killbot starts firing at the dummies, one of its lasers reflects back off of a mirror, hitting the killbot and setting it firing blindly. Linda is killed when one of the lasers hits her, and Rick, enraged, drives a store golfcart into the killbot, firing wildly. He is electrocuted by a bolt of electricity, but his actions finally destroy the second killbot completely. Their deaths leave Alison and Ferdy as the only two survivors to search for the control centre in the storage areas of the mall. The third and final killbot corners Alison who is rescued when Ferdy shoots it point blank, damaging its laser, and setting himself up as a target instead - the killbot strikes and appears to kill him as Alison escapes. Alison falls to the lower mall injuring her leg, and sets another trap for the killbot in a paint store, by mixing paint and chemicals from the shelves. She goads the killbot into the store where it becomes stuck - its tracks unable to find traction on the spilled paint and thinners - and throws the flare into the store where the volatile chemicals explode, destroying the final killbot. As she leaves the store, she hears Ferdy call her from the upper mall, revealing that he was still alive. The film ends with Alison and Ferdy together as the mall is now at daytime, showing that Alison and Ferdy survived the night massacre. After the credits roll, a killbot shows and says \"Thank you, have a nice day\" as then it cuts to black",

         "What more could you ask for in a cheesy horror film from the 1980s? This movie depicts a group of horny teenagers who are accidentally trapped in the mall overnight with three possessed security robots. Unreal circumstances, predictability, corny phrases, and partial nudity make this banal-plotted flick a true camp hit!",
         "Well, there is a whole lot of cheese in Chopping Mall. Remembering this movie from my childhood, I was compelled to rent it last night. Well, I am glad I did! Yeah, there isn't anything spectacular about the movie...There is a lot of Cheese (Automatic Rifles in a Mall?), but it still stands out as one of the better B-movies of the 80's. The Robots are pretty decent looking. The acting is typical for the genre and timeframe. The head explosion scene is just classic. I now feel compelled to track this down on Ebay, since I don't see an American DVD release anytime soon... Rent it and just enjoy the actual quality to this b-movie. I don't mean the acting, but the scenery and the robots. The CGI is laughable...but, that is another topic... 7 out of 10",
         "Ever wish you could hide out in a shopping mall overnight with your friends and do whatever you wanted to do there? Would you still do it if the mall was patrolled by security robots after hours? What if they were bigger than you, could move faster than you, and were equipped with lasers? And what if the computer that controls them was hit by lightening earlier tonight, so now they just patrol the mall killing anything that moves? It wouldn't be boring, that's for sure. Good movie to watch when you want something simple and lively.",
         "This film isn't half as gory as it's name and the box (which shows a metal hand holding a shopping bag filled with dismembered parts,) would have you think. The victims here die by lazer blasts, or are electicuted, or are dropped off high ledges. One girl is burned to death. The film's dummy title,\"Killbots\", is probably far more appropriate for this particular movie. The plot: at a shopping mall, presumably sometime in the not-too-distant future, a super computer is installed which is activated at night. It activates solid steal doors which seal off the enterances, making breaking in (and getting out,) almost impossible. The computer also controlls three high tech security robots, known as \"protector\" units. Then, one night, there is a thunder storm. Lightning strikes the antena on the roof of the mall, scrambling the computer's circuts, and the computer turns the protector robots into killing machines. After offing two techinitians hired to operate the computer overnight, and a janitor, (B-movie vet Dick Miller,) the protector units go after four teenage couples who've decided to spend the night in a mattress store for an orgy. Anybody who's familar with the teen extermination flicks of the 80's, or who've seen \"Scream\", will figure out right when the couples get together who will live and who will die. But the film is still worth seeing just for Keli Maroney's preformance as Alyson. She manages to play a strong female heroine without becoming a male clone. Her charecter is comparable to Ripley from the \"Alien\" series. Also, unlike some splatter movies, this one's more interesting in that the young people find out right away what's going on, and then they all battle the robots together, instead of one person getting seperated and killed, one by one until there's only one left. This is a definete must-see.",
         "Cheeky, but fun, 80's flick about killer robots. Has a pretty coherent plot without any major holes (except for maybe why a computer is put on the roof), not 1, not 2, but 3 robotic villains (who are rather polite for killer robots), and idiot humans that you want to see die anyway. It's a shame it's out of print.",
         "In this insignificant but nevertheless fun 80's low-budgeter, the sex-hungry teenagers for once aren't chased around by a killer wearing a ridiculous mask but by a troop of malfunctioning and heavily armed security robots! Four couples that work in various stores at the Park Plaza shopping mall secretly throw an after hours party during the same night when a lightening storm completely disorientates the 3 brand new \"Protector\" robots and get killed off one by one. \"Chopping Mall\" (how can you not love that title?) is a lot of fun to watch and it's easily Jim Wynorski's best effort out of more than 60 directed films. Despite the fact that \"Chopping Mall\" doesn't take itself too seriously and mainly focuses on satire, there really are some tense moments and properly mounted suspense sequences. The laser head-explosion sequence is famous and there are multiple other cheese-highlights. But what is perhaps the most surprising, are the engaging acting performances and the welcome amount of tasteful nudity. The most familiar cute face in the cast is Barbara Crampton who stars as a screaming beauty in between her two greatest films \"Re-Animator\" and \"From Beyond\". Truly ingenious are the endless references towards Roger Corman's repertoire, especially illustrated through cameos of Paul Bartel, Dick Miller and Mary Woronov. Unquestionably, \"Chopping Mall\" is a righteous guilty pleasure of many, many horror fans.",
         "I caught this one really late at night back in 1995, and I must say, I enjoyed it. It went under it's other name, Killbots, during that showing, and with a name like that, you know it's going to be cheesy and stupid. Cheesy it is, stupid it ain't. Forget the misleading title or cover art on the box, this movie is very entertaining if you like b-movies. I don't know why, but for once in a long while, especially in an 80's horror flick I was actually feeling for the characters. I can't explain why, but the acting and direction were both well done, and though it's more of a horror spoof than anything, it is quite a frightening concept. Though some of the deaths are stupid and the action scenes unrealistic, I couldn't help but see the similarities between this and Dawn of the Dead. I mean, these kids, once they figure out what's going on (and witness the famous head exloding scene) they wage war with the robots...I mean they break out a freaking arsenal and lay waste to these things (yeah, like Dawn of the Dead, what kind of mall would have firearms in it? I mean, one guy has an M-16 assault rifle!), though I can't remember them ever reloading once...it's all in good b-movie fun. The major complaints I have with this one is that, like I said before, some of the deaths are 'throw away', obvious and without style (most of the movie, they are running from cheesy 80's laser effects shooting all around them, but never hitting them...of course, when they do finally make contact, you never expect it), but it is still a good movie to watch on a boring friday night with friends and a couple cases of beer. I love the quote that the robots say every time that they dispatch one of the teens. It is simply priceless. Also, watch for Barabara Crampton of Re-Animator fame as one of the horny teenagers. Overall not bad, and when I think of the title and what this movie is, I'm surprising myself in giving it a 8/10.",
         "A group of teens(among them lovely Barbara Crampton from \"Re-Animator\" and \"From Beyond\")are terrorized in a shopping mall by a bunch of killer security robots.\"Chopping Mall\" is a highly energetic horror film that is perfect for younger horror fans.The film is well-made,delightfully cheesy and it offers some memorable set-pieces(check out a head explosion scene!).The characters are likeable and there are some great one liners.Highly recommended.Director Jim Wynorski made also \"Sorority House Massacre 2\",\"976 Evil 2:The Astral Factor\" and \"Hard to Die\".",
         "CHOPPING MALL is one of those cheapies made in the 1980s that was probably green-lighted because of the expanding video market. Even though it was released theatrically, CHOPPING MALL looks more like a direct-to-video movie than anything else. The video I saw had a terrible transfer (out of focus and murky) and the cheesiness of it all could have made this a chore to sit through but even with those things going against it, the film was fun and fast paced. It's totally played for laughs and never takes itself seriously. The upbeat goofiness basically saves CHOPPING MALL from the usually unwatchable Concord/New World junk. It's a definite minor Cult film.",
         "I don't know, but I really enjoyed this. \"I like pepperoni.\" The unpredictability of the lasers....wow. Having them bounce off most of the time and then suddenly busting out the whooping stick and taking someone's head off...that was glorious. I mean, you'd think that they could have different colors or something for when the lasers change from \"good for scratching itches\" to \"incredibly destructively lethal beams of death\". Awesome premise for the movie, too, I mean, I can TOTALLY see a day in the future when all security is taken over by lethal security robots. As a matter of fact, right NOW, I think I'll go set about making that happen."
