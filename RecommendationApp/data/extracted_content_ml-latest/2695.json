         "Some years ago in the western suburbs of Sydney there was a particularly nasty rape and killing of a young nurse on her way home from work carried out by two brothers and their friend. The incident became known as the Anita Cobby case and although the killers were caught and convicted, its reverberations still continue in the NSW criminal justice system. This film, from Gordon Graham's play, is not a recounting of the Cobby case, but attempts to answer the question: what sort of people could have perpetrated such a crime? The answer given here, in a coldly clinical examination, is a domineering psychopath and his two compliant brothers brought up in a family where the women are treated as mere conveniences. David Wenham, more usually associated with pleasant off-beat characters like Diver Dan in the TV series \"Sea Change\", plays the evil Brett, who has just done time for assault, and is back home manipulating his family and girlfriend. Despite the fact he spends most of his time sitting around drinking beer, everyone is afraid of him. He has the happy knack of being able to inspire fear just by looking at someone and lowering his voice. It is a remarkably powerful performance. Toni Collette as Brett's girlfriend Michelle is able to give us some insight into why an apparently sane (if insecure) woman would want Brett - it's the buzz of his badness that attracts. Being derived from a play, there is drama here, but because the approach is also rather clinical, it does feel a bit like looking at cockroaches through a magnifying lens. It's hard to feel much empathy with Brett - whatever made him what he is, he's pretty nasty and permanent incarceration seems to be the best option. If there is any chance of redemption it is not evident here. The other brothers Glen and Stevie are not so bad (though Stevie has a violent streak), but easily led, or bullied. In other circumstances they would not have committed such a crime. So in the end it is down to Brett and we don't even get a hint as to why he is as he is. He does tell us \"we are all gods\" by which he means we are all responsible for what we do. In his case he's happy to be a murdering psychopath. So look out.",
         "A comment was made here that Australian films are more than just about \"three drag queens in a bus tripping across the outback, or a cast of actors falling all over each other because the lead actor is American.\" Well, thank God for those kinds of Aussie and Kiwi films, because between the sturm und Drang of ONCE WERE WARRIORS, THE UGLY and now this, you might start to think that Down Under is a place you'd never want to go to in a million years... Anyway, about the film. Very few American filmmakers visit this kind of cinematic territory, not because it isn't worth examining, but in most cases it alienates an audience looking for \"entertainment\" from Jump Street. The comparison to TAXI DRIVER is indeed apt, but you might say it's also been cross-bred with a touch of AT CLOSE RANGE as well. THE BOYS certainly reminds us all too well that we Americans certainly don't have the market cornered on testosterone-fueled, dimwitted, nihilistic, misogynist sociopaths, and here we get three for the price of one, and brothers yet. Though it tries to show us in small, subtle ways why they are the way they are, it's kind of difficult to muster up any sympathy for people who are this far gone into their own murky little world, especially when every frame drips with menace, and the potential for brutality that could explode at any moment (and eventually does.) Where American screenwriters and playwrights have dealt with the rage and hopelessness borne of lower class socio-economic circumstances in such \"literary\" fare ranging from A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE to TAXI DRIVER, the dynamics mapped out in THE BOYS are closer to LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN, both Hubert Selby Jr.'s undiluted novel of industrial strength squalor and despair, and director Uli Edel's gut-wrenching screen version. David Wenham gives us a psycho/sociopath every bit as memorable and searingly portrayed as Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle, the only difference being that even in the depths of his growing isolation, rage and despair, Travis managed to have some redeeming qualities, could stir some sense of empathy within us. Don't expect to find any of that here with Wenham's Brett Sprague. Already pretty far gone when he was arrested the first time for attempted robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and grievious bodily harm, he helps underscore the failure to rehabilitate any felon by incarceration, no matter what country you're in, and he comes out with a chip on his shoulder double the size of the one he had before. In fact, that coffee table he totes out of jail in the opening scene makes a fine metaphoric symbol. John Polson and Anthony Hayes deliver fine performances also as his brothers, Glenn and Stevie; half-wit ne'er-do-wells without a whole brain between them until Big Brother comes home. Domineering and manipulative, Brett is all too aware of how equally dangerous his brothers are compared to him. All they need is a spark to light the fuses of their dormant rage, and he has the matches to do it. The most truly depressing part of the film is not witnessing the human train wreck of the Sprague family's existence; it's having one look at their mother, Sandra (Lynette Curran) and realizing exactly why the brothers Sprague are the way they are. It would be easy to lay the blame all on Sandra's head, but you just know by the ineffectual way she tries without success to corral \"her boys,\" that she was probably raised no differently, nor were her parents...if they stuck around long enough, nor were THEIR parents, back and back, ad nauseum, ad infinitum. The same can be said for at least two of the women involved in their lives: Nola (Anna Lise), Stevie's pregnant girlfriend who may or may not be having his child, and Michelle (Oscar nominee Toni Collette, here in a role very unlike what we've seen her in lately), who is drawn to Brett's bad-boy charms like a forbidden aphrodisiac, but is certainly not ready for the bitter aftertaste of the venom that comes with it. The entire cast and crew have done an impeccable job of rendering a slice of urban Australian life we would not otherwise be aware of, under the direction of Rowan Woods, who is responsible for some of the darker episodes of the spectacular series FARSCAPE. Most notable is the growing sense of disaster that builds with every blackout, even with the flash-forward device that jerks us into the aftermath of \"the boys'\" horrible crime, until the devastating ending, when after making his speech about \"being our own gods\" to his acid-tripping siblings, the last three words he speaks: \"Let's get her,\" hold all the gruesome implication of the entire body count of the first SCREAM movie. All this, and you never see the actual crime they committed. Which is exactly the point, so effectively made here. You don't have to, to know how brutal it was. Looking for a light-hearted romp for the evening? Better skip this one. Want a hard-bitten, dark-as-midnight, kitchen-sink drama, warts, scabs and all? Help yourself. The Spragues sure can't do likewise.",
         "This movie is the most powerful piece of cinema to come out of Australia and the performances by all actors, and in particular David Wenham and Toni Colletter where incredible. It is in the same league as Romper Stomper, and, Chopper, but with better acting. This film was never intended to be a documentary or to be an insight into the criminal mind and those who have reviewed it as such have totally missed the point. This is a movie about smalltime criminals that pulls no punches and tells it as it is and doesn't try to glorify these characters unlike the sort of movies you see coming out of Hollywood that are from the same genre. If you are looking for a \"moral\" to the story, or to learn some \"facts\" about the criminal world you may be disappointed with this film. But if you like intensely realistic plot lines and powerful acting performances then you will find \"The Boys\" to be one of those movies that you must add to your DVD library.",
         "What a Movie...this movie was impacting, and left a sour taste in my mouth. Brett Sprague was an extremely nasty piece of works. David Wenham brought the character of Brett to life so brilliantly. I was in fear of this character, and what was the most frightening aspect was that this character felt real... not a \"Freddy Kruger\" type of unbelievable scary character, but a TRUE nightmare... there are people like Brett out there in the world, and that was what was so frightening for me. This movie had a tremendous sense of fear and danger throughout. Every performance was outstanding, especially those of David Wenham, Toni Collette and Lynette Curran. The women in the film sensed the imminent danger, but the brothers were just hopelessly and dangerously in awe of their brother, Brett. This is Australian film making at its best, and I would like to commend our film industry with taking risks, and encouraging our artists to continue to make wonderfully original and creative films. Congratulations to all concerned.",
         "This is acting at its best! Although confrontational, \"The Boys\" serves as a reminder that society is made up of many characters including those less than endearing in \"The Boys\". Brilliant ensemble acting including a stand out performance by David Wenham gives this movie the edge above the normal urban society story.",
         "Rowan Wood's film The Boys is a cracking little drama from Australia, driven by some excellent performances and notable for an early appearance from David Wenham & Toni Collette on screen together before they hit it big over in the states. This film is intense, taken as a slow burning drama it works incredibly well as a portrait of a working class Australian family tearing itself apart over the course of a single day. It culminates in an ending that leaves the viewer cold, featuring intertwined cut-scenes strewn throughout the film which show later consequences only serving to intensify the lack of resolution and bleakness present as the credits start to roll. As a director Rowan Woods adds some nice touches though the main focus of the film is on developing the characters present. The opening sequences feature an almost surrealistic focus on an everyday Australian household setting and the objects within it, something quite unknown to me in the realms of film which sets a spooky tone to the minimalist soundtrack composed by The Necks. Grainy shots of the city at night between sequences further this, capturing perfectly the maudlin vibes I know so well. The Boys is a very well made film, one of the most accomplished dramas to have come out of Australia. Being born on these shores personally and having known people who live like this it becomes all the more relevant. It is bleak but despite this there is an uneasy humor throughout, the plight of the ultimately pathetic characters striking an ambiguity where you don't know whether to laugh or feel disturbed. This is life... is it not?",
         "The filmmakers of \"The Boys\" get so deep inside the blamings and self pity of humanity's monsters, you could almost miss the culpability of the ineffectual women who enable them to grow up into walking catastrophes. The events of this film, set off by the first day of parole for angry young headcase Brett Sprague, lead to a decision so horribly wrong-headed and repellent, that a suspended moment of nothing but a black screen is one of the most excruciating pregnant pauses in the history of films. Up to this point, there's a kitchen sink drama like almost no other (Gary Oldman's \"Nil By Mouth\" a close cousin, but not nearly as upsetting) and lacerating performances by the cast and crew - The sound designer gets a deserved opening credit. It appears that this movie was well appreciated in Australia, but had an abortion of a release here in the US. Now that it's on video, it's one of the best lost gems you're likely to score this year.",
         "The Western suburbs of Sydney and Brett is released from prison to be welcomed back into his own prison, Home. The family are at odds with life and Brett makes matters worse. By evenings end the brothers dwell into a deep dark void and go on a primitive hunt. A disturbing film capturing the struggle of the male species placed at the bottom of the social ladder. Brett, repressed by the laws of society and the repressor of the weak, portrays the primitive role of man as he and his brothers roam within the confines of their cave where they rule supreme. In the outside world they are powerless. They even fail in controlling their women that their forefathers were able to do with a heavy hand. So society has changed but not the testerone levels these men carry. Have we gone against nature and created these oppressed monsters who break and rise to seek their fury on the weak? A wonderful discussion to have over a beer and BBQ. The director Woods opts for the neo-realist approach that works in the confine spaces of the house. Strong filmmaking for a small film carrying important issues.",
         "I'm surprised by the negative reviews I've read here so far, but, thankfully, there are some great positive summaries offsetting these. I don't know whether it's \"The Great Aussie Film\" or not, but it's a great film, alright, and like a few members here, I've known people like these, and having known them, have absolutely no sense of sympathy for them. The experiences I draw from are from a working class childhood... and, interestingly enough, I guess, the worst, overtly violent characters came from lower income families (the covertly nasty ones are another story entirely). I recall no books in their apartments/townhouses, no value on education, their TVs droning endlessly, little to no parental interest -- much less control -- of any kind with those kids (unless one or the other parent took the time to kick the crap out of one or the other of them). My capacity for empathy goes only so far: those people were like human piranhas, every one of them. I suppose part of the film's point is asking what creates characters like these. There is none of the ubiquitous overt violence common to just about all films now: something the director deserves high marks for, and all performances were outstanding. An Australian poster on a bulletin board recommended it, and he was dead on. Alas, I could only get it as a used VHS tape, but here's to hoping it'll magically appear on DVD over here sometime.",
         "This movie is not entertainment and should be approached with caution. That said, it is a powerful insight into how a certain strata of society lives. You see the boredom and hopelessness and the effect it has on the individual and the family. The strength of the movie lies in the control and stillness of the main character. This is not a man you want to meet, let alone upset."
