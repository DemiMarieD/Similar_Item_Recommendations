         "Alex de la Iglesia has got to be one of the coolest directors ever. I liked Accion Mutante but I LOVED Day of the beast. It is a shame this movie has not been played in america because it's one of the best movies in a long time. It's funny...very funny if you have a weird type of humor. It's not really bloody and gory like people have stated but some scenes have a shock value to them. Visually Day of the Beast is wonderful it's darkley filmed and has cool production designes. The actors for the most part do a good job only sometimes they go a little over the top. The only thing wrong is that this movie begins to run out of steam at the end and the ending is kinda confusing and when satan appears it's a let down. But all in all a cool movie and a good time.......if only our awards were like spain's",
         "When you consider all the elements that have gone into this movie, it's hard to deny that it really shouldn't have worked. Spanish director Álex de la Iglesia has put together a film that fuses ideas of the apocalypse and the antichrist with heavy metal and one of the blackest streaks of humour that I've ever seen. Day of the Beast starts off with a string of blackly comic happenings, which see such things as a man crushed by a cross and a priest pushing a performer off his perch. Amazingly, the director manages to keep the laughs coming throughout, while at the same time ensuring that the apocalyptic tones aren't lost to the comedy side of the film. Personally, I didn't think that much else could be done with the idea of the antichrist - but I've been well and truly proved wrong by this totally unique horror flick! The plot follows a priest who believes that he has found a secret code of some sort, and that he has to commit evil acts in order to get an audience with Satan himself, so that he can kill the Devil's child, which he believes will be born on Christmas Eve. Aiding him in this quest is a drug-taking heavy metal fan, and the host of a paranormal TV series... I've got to say that I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Álex de la Iglesia's films, as this guy has an absolutely great sense of humour; and even though this movie is only half a comedy, it's far funnier than many films designed only to make its audience laugh. The laughs are very dry indeed, and are guaranteed to appeal to people who appreciate jokes that are aimed at offending people. Aside from a great sense of humour and an interesting storyline, Day of the Beast also benefits from a plethora of great performances from a talented cast of Spanish actors. Álex Angulo, Armando De Razza and Santiago Segura are brilliant as the central threesome, and offset each other nicely with their defined and very different characters. While the film definitely is a comedy, it's obvious that Álex de la Iglesia is a horror fan; as the atmosphere is morbid and suspenseful, and many scenes are extremely suspenseful and well laid out. The special effects are hokey in true demonic horror style, and the light use of them ensures that they work well when used. Overall, I don't hesitate to call this a masterpiece. Day of the Beast is everything you could want from a cult horror movie and more!",
         "After watching this brilliant movie,I came to conclusion that(besides \"Braindead\")this is the best horror/comedy of the 90's.The acting is great,the characters are captivating,the photography is nice and the humour scenes are excellent.This is the first horror/comedy from Spanish director Alex de la Iglesia.Hey guy,I hope to hear about you soon.The funniest sequence is when the priest is looking for the blood of the virgin to summon Satan.On the other hand,this creative film beats any of these expensive pseudo-horror movies from Hollywood.If you are a real horror-fan like me you should check it out.",
         "On rare occasions, a movie appears that successfully mixes elements of comedy with those of horror without being silly, cheesy or vulgar. Alex De la Iglesia's superb \"El Día de la Bestia\" is definitely one of those movies. With an interesting plot, very likable characters, good SFX(considering the low budget) and a great cast, this formidable movie from Spain turns instantly in a cult classic by it's own merits. Alex Angulo stars as father Angel, a priest who is also a scholar of theology, and that has discovered that John's revelation contains encoded the date and place for the birth of the Antichrist: Christmas Eve of 1995 in Madrid. With that knowledge, he decides to turn himself into a satanist in order to discover the exact place of the birth. With the aid of metal-head Jose Maria(played by Santiago Segura) and the fake psychic Professor Cavas(played superbly by Armando De Razza), he goes on his quest to kill the baby before the anti-Christ's reign begins. The story is filled with very dark humor as the priest has to sin in order for him to be convincing enough as a satanist. Alex Angulo really carries the film and gives a great performance, but is Armando De Razza who steals the show; Cavas and his girlfriend(played by beautiful Maria Grazia Cucinotta) have a great scene and Maria shines on her small role as the dumb blonde who dates Cavas. De la Iglesia takes us on the roller-coaster that is this movie, as it never drags and goes on with a fast-paced rhythm. A great camera-work makes the film even better and the bizarre beauty of it's photography, contrasting the colorful Christmas with the dark gritty violence of the streets of Madrid. Overall a near-perfect film, \"El Día de la Bestia\" will keep you entertained with it's irreverent(some would say blasphemous) dark humor. 10/10. Very recommended.",
         "When you hear Spanish films, Aldomovar is always brought up. Unfortunately, films like Dia De La Bestia suffer. This film is a treat to people who like their comedy dark and have a weird sense of humour. The Apocalypse never looked more interesting than in this film. Visually the film is darkly lit and the appearance of Satan changes the whole mood of the film. Next time you see this film in a film festival, DON'T MISS IT!!!",
         "I have become increasingly dissatisfied with most of Hollywood's output, horror or otherwise. Too many movies are either highly cynical commercial products, aimed at teenagers with no discernment or real love of movies, compromised messes that please no-one, stale rehashes of previous works, or just plain STUPID. 'The Day Of The Beast' is none of these things! I was almost put off by the packaging with it's description of a \"horror action comedy\", expecting some kind of juvenile 'Army Of Darkness' crap (a movie I have no time for). Surprisingly, it DOES have horror, action and comedy, but blends them in original and exciting ways Hollywood hasn't dreamed of. Just compare this to recent supernatural themed thrillers like the brain-dead 'End Of Days' or 'Stigmata', and you'll see that director Alex de la Iglesia is working on a much more intelligent and provocative level. 'The Day Of The Beast' concerns a naive priest's attempts to summon Satan so that he can try and prevent the birth of the Antichrist and Armageddon. He befriends a hilarious acid-gobbling Metal fan (the wonderful Santiago Segura), and with the reluctant assistance of the host of a TV show dealing with the paranormal, the two comrades bumble through a series of adventures while trying to complete their task. The whacky humour and general silliness is balanced with a genuinely dark vision of Madrid and this is what gives this movie such a unique flavour. It juggles comedy, horror and social criticism marvellously, and never loses sight of it's themes of faith, evil and moral responsibility. I can't recommend this movie highly enough as the antidote to the onslaught of contemporary asinine horror and fantasy movies. Make sure you track down the original undubbed Spanish version to fully appreciate it. 'The Day Of The Beast' ranks up with Mexico's 'Cronos' and Canada's 'Ginger Snaps' as one of the most imaginative and original horror movies of the last ten years. Don't miss it!",
         "A complete cult film in Spain. I think Alex is one of the most original talents in nowadays cinema. And not only in Spain, all over the world. You have to realize what it means to issue such a film, and what a danger you take. How he uses black humour and keeps tension on every scene is incredible. And he has shown that in every one of his films, specially in The perfect crime (a pearl of how to use black humour), 800 bullets and Common Wealth. These are films to take with an open mind, no previous thoughts of what are you going to find. I'm still surprised at each one of his new films. A masterpiece, but not a film for everybody.",
         "While El Dia De La Bestia had some logic errors, such as easily finding a virgin at her late 20's, it was a good film overall. It's designed as a thriller-comedy so you can't expect everything to be perfectly logical anyway. The only film I've seen with a similar plot was The Devil's Advocate, and I have to say this one was a few million times better. It's time dear Americans see it takes not only expensive FX but also and more importantly soul to make a good film. Probably 99.9% of the spectators of the film didn't pay attention, but Maria Grazia Cuccinotta shines in the bimbo role more than any other part of the cast does. But the general cast is quite flawless too. I have to say there's some good music in the film also :) I don't care if it's associated with satan, it's still good to hear metal in films like this one. If you've watched and liked The Devil's Advocate, and just like me, you think the film seems to have everything necessary to be a good film but something's terribly missing, you'll see that missing thing is right in its place in El Dia De La Bestia. Brilliant comedy, brilliant thriller, absolutely unique. 9/10.",
         "As films like \"Perdita Durango\" prove, Spanish director Álex De La Iglesia is a specialist for macabre humor. One of his earlier films, \"El Dia De La Bestia\" aka. \"The Day Of The Beast\" of 1995 is a perfect example for this director's talent, a macabre and hilarious black horror comedy that entertains highly from the beginning to the end. A catholic priest (Álex Angulo) goes to Madrid in order to prevent the birth of the Antichrist, which he believes to take place there on Christmas Day. In order to find the exact place where the Antichrist is to be born, the kind-hearted priest is forced to commit 'Sins', and furthermore associates with the surprisingly friendly Death-Meal lover and Satanist Jose Maria (Santiago Segura)... Angulo and Segura both fit very well in their roles, especially Angulo is very hilarious as the priest. Armando De Razza is furthermore great, and hilarious as Cavan, a hypocritical TV psychic. Director De La Iglesia did a great job making this film a hilarious Horror-comedy and still maintaining a dark and somehow gloomy atmosphere. If you like satirical Horror, make sure not to miss \"El Dia De La Bestia\", and enjoy 100 minutes of macabre humor and originality. Highly Recommended!",
         "Over a year ago I accidentally bought Day of the Beast off Ebay with no subs. Finally after a long wait I got the chance to check out this flick, and what a damn shame I wasn't more safe when buying it the first time, because this was a really good flick. El Dia De La Bestia is a comedy/horror/action hybrid that really meshes on a level that few movies have. It's Xmas Eve and a Priest, Metalhead and a TV Host band together to try stop the Anti-Christ from being born. Sounds like the beginning of a joke, but it's the truth and these guys go through some ridiculous stuff trying to accomplish their goal. The acting, cinematography, directing and especially the screen play were all great. The writing was fast, realistic and smart, just like how the movie played out. Day of the Beast has barely has any dull scenes, it's funny, and moves at a pretty fast pace. I suppose it's not gonna be everyone's cup of tea, but hell, for me, there's nothing in it worth complaining about. I really hope this film gets more popular, because it definitely has the opportunity to have a large fan base. Hopefully someday it will get some more recognition and you'll be seeing it in Best Buys and so on. And the best part is the director has many more flicks that are supposed to be just as good. If you're looking for a plain old good flick, look no further, Day of the Beast is it."
