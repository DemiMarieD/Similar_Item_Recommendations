         "You have to watch a few other movies first to really appreciate this. The main two movies you have to watch first is Menace II Society and Boyz N The Hood. 'Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood' spoofs these two to the max but if you haven't seen these two movies most of this movie will be lost on you. It pretty much is good from beginning to end and i can't think of anything bad to say about it. I particularly like the scene with Officer Self Hatred. This movie isn't a total spoof of movies with a couple of original jokes here and there. The Wayans brothers are good in whatever movie they are in so go watch 'White Chicks' and the first two Scary Movie's. If you like this then i also recommend 'CB4' which is equally hilarious. 9/10",
         "Spoofing practically every \"growing up in the hood\" movie, \"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\" is a laugh a minute. Following the adventures of Ashtray (Shawn Wayans) and Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) in LA's black ghetto, it's one joke after another - the way that a Mel Brooks or Leslie Nielsen movie is. Probably the funniest scene is when they enter a convenience store. The owner, convinced that African-Americans would only enter his store to steal things, follows them around - while a rich white man comes in and proceeds to empty the place. Containing virtually every imaginable use of the N-word, \"DBAMTSCWDYJITH\" is pure hilarity. Those Wayans brothers have it down.",
         "This movie is wonderful. It points out all of the absurdities of the earlier 'hood movies. You need to have seen most of the movies being parodied in order to see the true depth of the humor in this movie. Absolutely one of my favorite light comedies with \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\" and \"Half Baked\". I can't put it in a category with \"Airplane\" because that is the standard by which all other parodies are measured.",
         "This movie has the privelge of being better than the movie \"Friday\", it has taken the spot for top \"ghetto\" comedy movie ever. The story isn't what's great, but the acting an great spoofs of \"serious ghetto movies\" is! Making fun of many movies, \"Don't Be A Menace...\" takes a back seat to no comedy. A definite must see comedy.",
         "I was watching an old \"Honeymooners\" rerun with a friend and we came to Jackie Gleason's Ralph's inevitable \"To the moon, Alice!\" expression of frustration with his wife, and suddenly I realized that it WAS inevitable, so why were we laughing, having heard it a dozen times before? My friend pointed out that Gleason's timing - the manner in which he held his slow-burn, the widening of his eyes, the sudden \"Bang! Zoom\" take off into the line - was what always made it funny. We weren't laughing at the line so much at the performance of it. \"Don't Be A Menace\" is the most obvious collection of predictable gags and bits I have seen in a long time, but it is by far the funniest. The Wayans are rather stuck - the genres they parody here have very rigid conventions, so much so that there is usually only one or two gags one can use to mock them - e.g., when a young gangsta warns us that many young men in the 'hood don't live to see their 21st birthday, we all know what's coming next. So the Wayans handle it in a manner that delays the punchline while emphasizing its obviousness. Thus we laugh with them, appreciating the way they pull it off, and recognizing the gangsta genre limit that's getting parodied, rather than at the bit itself. Just about the whole movie operates on this level, and for this reason has become one of my favorite comedies. The Wayans capture every moment with a dead-on rhythm that blends the gags into a kind of music. Shawn plays the steady bass while Marlon does some wild riffing. Other characters and bits drop in and out like improvisation and sound effects. Keenan Wayans drops in every now and then like the voice on a scratch dub. The tempo could have been a little swifter, but the rhythm itself is excellent. Comedy like this is very tricky, and I personally didn't think the Wayans' efforts in the \"Scary Movie\" films were quite as successful - but here they move it right along. It's rude, it's crude, it's in-yor-face - and it's just a delight to watch.",
         "Besides having a title that is funny in itself, Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood is one of the funniest movies this decade. It spoofs such black films as Boyz N' Tha Hood, Dead Presidents, Juice, Menace II Society, and South Central with such hilarity that you'll be repeating its many classic lines over and over again for months. Wayans brothers who started on In Living Clor and made the hilarious 1988 movie I'm Gonn Git U Sucka do it again with this long overdue spoof of movie that are extremely serious. Classic lines and memorable scenes saturate this movie beginning to end. All characters are well acted and comic pacing and sight gags are at a peak not reached since Top Secret or Naked Gun. Multiple viewings add to the fun. Hilarious. I was foolin` y`all! Those was jokes!",
         "Shawn and Marlon Wayans, along with director Paris Barclay, have created a very humorous satire of the flood of films recently dealing with African-American life in the ghettos of inner-cities of America. \"Boyz in the Hood\" and \"Menace II Society\" are among the films at which the Wayans brothers poke fun. \"Don't be a Menace...\" follows the story of Ashtray(Shawn Wayans) as he wades through a series of episodes in Barclay's \"hood.\" He lives with his father, who is \"only a couple of years older than him.\" Among the lessons his father teaches him are: \"No smokin' my shit, no drinkin' my shit, and if you bring any of them hos up in here, make sure I fuck 'em first\", and (drinking and driving)\"That shit is fun, man!\" No stereotype or politically-correct boundary is too sacred for the Wayans brothers to poke fun at. Some of the jokes hit, some miss, and the fun will definitely be increased by those who have seen the films that \"Don't Be A Menace...\" frequently jests. Not extremely culturally-important fare, but a good laugh, nonetheless.",
         "This film is one of the best spoof films i have seen in a while. The Wanyes brothers bring their unique comedy style to a great comedy. i suppose you have to have seen all of the films which they are making fun of to fully appreciate the comedy but once you have seen Menace II Society, Boyz 'n' the Hood, Friday And Higher Learning you will want to watch this film over and over again",
         "Renting this movie I was expecting another comedy to the likes of \"Class Act\" \"Booty Call\" and \"House Party\", which were all great movies. But I got so much more. This parody of movies such as \"Menace II Society\" Boyz N Da Hood\" and \"Dead Presidents\" was funny as hell. They really poke fun at themselves to the extreme, making fun of guns, booze and lets not forget the ladies. I really enjoyed this, it was a movie where you could grab some popcorn lay back, switch your mind off and laugh non stop.",
         "Honestly, you will not like this movie at all if you haven't seen any ghetto movies or don't understand ghetto humor. Like most spoof movies, it won't be funny if you don't know what is being made fun of. If either of these things are true, see this movie. If not, don't bother. I think that I have never laughed harder than during this movie. One of my personal favorite comedies."
