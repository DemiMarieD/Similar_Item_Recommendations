      "synopsis": "Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) is about to give the main speech in an exclusive party in Puerto Rico. He is called to the police station to be questioned about his finding of a raped and murdered young girl the day before. Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman), and the younger Detective Felix Owens (Thomas Jane) question him. Hearst changes his story several times: he was jogging with a neighbour's dog, he found her, the dog found her, he was jogging without the dog, so the police think he has done it. Benezet is pressured by his boss (Miguel Ángel Suárez) to free Hearst so that he can give his speech. However, as there is no conclusive proof, Benezet has to let him go. At the party, a crowd is gossiping, and Chantal Hearst (Monica Bellucci), his wife, has to keep her composure. She will be questioned later, after her husband gives his speech without his wig, to confirm why she and her husband sleep in separate rooms. Little by little, the story each of them tells changes. Hearst first blames Chantal for being jealous. Then, it's discovered he likes cheap very young prostitutes. Hearst says that Chantal and artist Paco Rodriguez (Luis Caballero) are lovers. He's the husband of Chantal's sister María (Jacqueline Duprey). Chantal says that he saw Hearst with her niece Camille (Isabel Algaze) giving her presents and trying to seduce her. Also, she tells that once she saw her husband washing his blood-stained clothes at night. Pressure over Henry increases. Finally, Chantal, the legal owner of the mansion where they live (it was Henry's present), signs a form permitting the police to look for more clear proof. At the dark room, they find the photos of the two murdered girls and many previous snapshots of them. Henry says that it must be Chantal's trap. He doesn't divorce her because she would be entitled to one half of everything and the mansion. Henry gives up. He starts confessing it all. Suddenly, Benezet is interrupted. Another police officer tells him that they have found the real murderer in a car, pestering some other young girl and with the recorded videos kept in his car. Benezet and Owens free Henry. Henry doesn't forgive Chantal for trying to frame him. (At least that's my interpretation of the ending)",

         "Most of this dialogue-intensive film takes place in an office in a Puerto Rican Police Department with a top detective (Freeman) grilling a wealthy attorney (Hackman) about the rape/murders of young girls. Featuring outstanding performances by both principals and technical and artistic excellence, the film's story unfolds piecemeal as it scrutinizes the Hackman character with painful deliberation while holding out the \"whodunnit\" carrot until the very end. More mature audiences with an appetite for this type of film are likely to find \"Under Suspicion\" a spellbinding tour de force by Hackman.",
         "'Under Suspicion,' a remake of the French film 'Garde a Vue,' is as compelling and engrossing a psychological thriller as I've seen in years. The drama is wonderfully tense and taut, and, best of all, the suspense holds out until near the very end of the film, lingering on afterward for hours in the viewer's mind. Gene Hackman plays Henry Hearst, a successful attorney in San Juan, Puerto Rico who lives an apparently blissful life of luxury--he's got money, respect, a gorgeous house on the coast, and, most of all, a stunningly beautiful young trophy wife, Chantal (Monica Belluci, the voluptuous heir-apparent to Sophia Loren, in one of her first US roles). On the eve of the feast of St. Sebastian, during which Hearst is set to deliver an address at a fundraiser for hurricane relief, he is called in to the police department by his longtime acquaintance Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) for additional questioning surrounding the death of a young girl. It seems that earlier that day, Hearst discovered the girl's body while jogging. It doesn't take long to discover that Hearst is a suspect, particularly when he is repeatedly threatened and insulted by the tactless Owens (Thomas Jane), a loose-cannon junior detective hot to make his first big bust. As the interrogation progresses--interspersed with stylish flashbacks combing memory and real-time--it becomes apparent that the case is far more complicated than it first appeared. It seems that the imminently respectable Henry Hearst has a fetish for young girls and a secret life involving internet pornography and prostitutes. Simultaneously revealed is Captain Benezet's longstanding jealousy of Hearst, whom he has watched gain wealth and prestige while Benezet has lost his wife to divorce and struggled to get by. As the intense intellectual combat continues, truth becomes more and more murky, to the point that the characters are not even sure of their own motives or actions. This movie really stuck with me. Without giving anything away, let me say that the film will force you to consider the complexity of truth and memory and the degree to which psychological trauma and coercion can influence what we know about ourselves. Hackman and Freeman are superb, and it's a pleasure to watch them stretching their skills and chewing up the excellent dialogue as their characters confront each other. Thomas Jane gives one of his better performances as the hot-tempered Owens, and Monica Belluci gives a subtle and convincing performance while simultaneously being so unbelievably gorgeous that you can't take your eyes off of her. The direction by Stephen Hopkins is superb--creepy and stylish, the cinemetography makes maximum use of San Juan's many settings. For some reason this one really flew below the radar when it was released. I highly recommend it as an excellent, memorable suspense thriller with meaning and substance.",
         "In the middle of San Sebastian's Feast celebration in San Juan, tax attorney Henry Hearst is guest of honour at a fund raising event to help repair damage from a tropical storm. However, less than an hour before the event, Henry is called into the police station by friend Capt Victor Benezet to clarify some points on his statement. Henry had discovered a dead child on a local beach but the police doubt some of the things in his story. As the time ticks down, Victor comes under pressure to release Henry but at the same time his story begins to reveal lies. The situation is only made more revealing when Henry's wife comes into the station. Everyone loves a good thriller so it was a surprise to me how quickly this film with it's heavy-weight cast managed to slip through the UK cinemas almost unnoticed. There is nothing significantly wrong with it to justify the low box office it seemed to generate, so I'm not sure why it happened. The story is set, for unknown reasons, in San Juan, a fact that is only distracting as none of the principals are Puerto Rican and their presence there is never really settled. Anyway, the film is very much a play that is carried by the two main characters. The revelations and movement of the plot is engaging and it is great fun to watch. The ending is difficult though - we are taught to expect a certain type of ending in this sort of film and it is slightly disappointing when it doesn't come. I expected a big twist and, in a way, that happened but the fall out from it isn't well explained by the film and a lot is left for you to think about. In that respect it is difficult, again because we are not expecting that type of ending but also that it is quite hard to understand as it is very tied up in the emotions of complex characters - complexities that we having been watching because we've only been seeing them as `twists' and revelations. That said, I still enjoyed the ending and thought it was brave to be different - just a shame it was badly handled. The cast are roundly great and are a big reason that the film remains gripping. Hackman and Freeman are great actors and having them both in the same film was enough of a draw to get me watching. The vast majority of their scenes are shared and they interact together really, really well when it comes to the dramatics. What they don't do as well is convince that they really are old friends. Jane is good but his character is far too simplistic and brash. Bellucci is better than I have seen her, but she is a little too wound up emotionally. She is very good looking and I was glad that the film didn't just trade on that, but it didn't (or couldn't) get a great deal out of her. The director manages to add energy and style to what could have been a rather contain piece (like a play). Visually it is exciting but, looking back, it was more important to develop character than deliver a slick thriller - something he didn't do well at all. The ending is weak because it takes thought, as we have not been forced to look at the complex characters. It was Hopkins' job to make us do that but he can't manage it. Overall this is an enjoyable film that will frustrate many with the ending. Despite being a clever and different conclusion, it doesn't really work because of the director making the wrong sort of film to suit that ending. However for the vast majority it really works and the strength of the two lead performances mean that, for all it's flaws, this is never a dull film.",
         "SPOILERS ---- What amazes me is how many of you viewers are so quick to condemn this movie because you just don't get it. Do movies always have to wrap things up into tight little packages for them to be workthwile? Personally, I prefer movies that require you to think a little after it is over to allow you to come up with what you think is the real meaning to all of it. Under Suspicion is that kind of movie. It was pretty obvious to me that the movie wasn't as much a murder mystery as much as it was about a man struggling with his own personal demons, in particular, the loss of the love of his life and his obsession with young women. If you've ever been in a relationship that ends poorly but you still are in love with that person, you might understand. It is quite obvious to me that Hackman's character is in love with young (very young) beauty. That is his flaw. His stumbling during the investigations is a direct result of his attempt to hide that flaw and to reveal very personal things about his life and relationship with his wife. His obsession about young women is why he had the photographs of them and why he knew one of them. By telling the truth, he would have to reveal this obsession. His wife has her own problems, that is the green monster he was talking about - jealousy. She knows him too well that she fears that as she ages, she will lose him to younger girls. She allows this obsession of hers to take over her reason and let's it destroy her relationship with her husband. In the end, Hackman's character is a lost puppy, weak and pathetic, because he is unwilling to let go of a lost love as he still loves her deeply and is in denial of the fact that she won't come back to him. He is holding on to that shred of hope that she will realize the error of her ways and love him again. But she can't do that. In the end when he finally realizes that she actually believes in his guilt and helped to find the \"evidence\" against him, he finally realizes and accepts that she will never overcome her jealousy and come back. So, he has nothing to live for and he confesses, mostly to get back at her I think. By confessing, he will ruin her too as she will lose all social standing she has, etc. And I think there is some self-pugilizing too. I think he may also be trying to punish himself for being such a fool for her and for his obsession with young women. The interrogation may have convinced him that he was wrong for having this obsession, so his confessing accomplishes both - punishing her and himself. In the end, she realizes her mistake and even contemplates suicide, but decides to try to make up for it and come back to him. He, however, actually has made some progress by finally being able to let her go and rejects him. She ends up losing in the end and he gains some self respect. At least that is where I think the movie goes. A couple of small points that people are making. I am not sure why Puerto Rico was picked. Except maybe to add some irony by injecting an exotic locale. I don't think that choice is necessarily a good one, not necessarily a bad choice either. But it doesn't work well and it may have been the director's choice not to exploit that. Maybe the book got into it deeper. Also, the friendship between Freeman's character and Hackman's obviously took place much earlier in their lives. It appeared to me that they had really be estranged for a long time leading different lives, his in the wealthy, social world, Freeman in the working class world. They knew a little about each other, but not the details. I do think they could have expanded on this a little more for development though. Overall, I think this is a very good movie and worth seeing if not for Freeman and especially Hackman's performances. Hackman doesn't often do a movie where he plays a vulnerable character.",
         "A film with Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman in the two main roles is a dream come true for anyone who loves the art of acting, and their performances here (especially Hackman's, who after all does have the more showy part) are stunning. Stephen Hopkins' direction is hip, inventive and unstagy (though it must be said that his \"a person can physically visit someone else's flashbacks\" trick had already been done three years earlier, in \"The Ugly\"), the dialogue is sharp, and the story is compelling. So what's wrong with this picture? You guessed it...the ending! Simply put, the ending is baffling and unbelievable, no matter how you try to \"explain\" it. This film closely resembles the 1994 French thriller \"A Pure Formality\", and the irony is that, although that was a much worse film overall, it had a genuine surprise at the end, while \"Under Suspicion\" has the kind of \"surprise\" that makes the whole film come off as one big red herring. (**1/2)",
         "Ignore the grumbling about camera work, inexplicable location, Thomas Jane, and some peculiar directorial choices. See this movie for Hackman - I'm hard pressed to think of a more fully realized performance on film. He's just extraordinary.",
         "Okay, I commented on this movie once a few days ago, encouraging viewers to go and watch it and not try to learn too much before seeing it, so as not to tarnish their perceptions. So many are troubled by the ending and don't understand. No doubt, it makes you think and doesn't hand over instant satisfaction or relief from the conflict. Does life always. Well, here's the importance and brilliance of the ending. Henry is like many of us. Little parts of our lives taken out of context or thrown into the wrong context could leave us having to \"explain.\" More than one part, public embarrassment, a mixture of betrayal and enough suspicion could put you in Henry's shoes. To highlight. The dog. The dog ran with him like most times. But he didn't meet the dog like usual, rather the dog met him on the trail. Even Henry first recalled it happened like always until he really remembered it hadn't. But the dog was there and the dog found the girl. The dog's owner says otherwise. Camille. Nothing really happened with Camille. But now, like the dog, it looks suspicious to investigators. His wife always thought so and made it part of Henry's nightly problem before this ever surfaced. Something so familiar to him, he blurted out a denial before his wife ever brought it to investigator's attention. Now they make it their business to discover all they can about this from her, and get her side naturally. Henry visited websites, innocently like many of us, but now the police see the pornsites he looked at while he believed things were private and now he must explain. He is a prolific photographer. As photographer's always do - he shot many rolls of indiscriminate film and not surprising (by itself) captured some of the victims at some point. The victims were public people (which is part of why they became victims) and Henry had an abundance of pictures related to these scenes around him. All this suspicion and pressure, and his wife and the \"lengths she went to\" as Henry said, when learning she dug through his darkroom and discovered photos he didn't even realize he owned. Then she gave them to the police. He stands as the only one saying aside from all this, he didn't do the murders. He looks at the mirror and tells his wife to \"come in here and face me.\" Given all his thoughts and feelings, even he decides to go along with everyone. He gives up. Doesn't care. He's the last one to join the parade. It all played out and he tosses his hand. Begins his false confession which is fueled by facts he learned from listening to the interrogators over the last few hours. (He never suspected his wife did the murders as some have said). Then an undisputable circumstance rears it's head and suddenly everyone pulls the weight of suspicion away from Henry. For the first time they are on his side. He's \"free\" but really far worse off than he ever was because of all the things he realized about his life. He's has to accept who and where he is, whether deserved or undeserved. As viewer's we became an integral part of directing suspicion towards Henry, we too began thinking and agreeing about his guilt. We too, wanted to find the shred of evidence that made him \"100% guilty.\" It isn't there, nor was it ever - just like Henry said. The character's in the film are deflated, confused and unhappy with the ending - just like you are!!",
         "I read some time ago that Morgan Freeman tried unsuccessfully for many years to produce a remake of the French movie, GARDE à VUE ( Claude Miller, 1981) before getting Gene Hackman interested in the project; despite their notoriety, a few more years were required before the UNDER SUSPICION filming started, with the two players acting also as executive producers (Hackman's sole attempt to date, Freeman's second out of five ones). SPOILERS AHEAD SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES. Both movies have (of course) the same basic plot: a VIP, having found the corpse of a young girl, reports it and soon becomes the main suspect of two rapes and murders for the police, but also for his wife; the man, entangled in lies about his doings during the night of the first murder, and facing adverse testimonies in connection with the second one, is unable to reverse the growing inner conviction of the police; the last straw occurs when his wife supplies a piece of circumstantial evidence; he then gives it up and confesses crimes he is innocent of.. Both have four main protagonists: the suspect (Michel Serrault/Gene Hackman) and his wife (Romi Schneider/Monica Bellucci), two inspectors (Lino Ventura/Morgan Freeman and Guy Marchand/Thomas Jane). In both cases the marriage has previously crumbled. Not having read the \"Brainwash\" novel by John Wainwright, I do not know which movie is the closer to it. But the treatments of the films are very different. Claude Miller sets his story in a middle-sized country town of (presumably) the North of France, on a cold rainy night, and most of it takes place in the dreary ill-equipped defectively-lighted office shared by the two inspectors in charge of the inquest, thus establishing a grim depressive atmosphere; the necessary flashbacks are few and as short as possible. UNDER SUSPICION on the contrary is situated in hot and sunny Puerto-Rico, and the police office is large, clear, and apparently suitably fitted: hence we do not understand why Morgan Freeman, sole inhabitant of the room, complains about it; and the defective lamp, if it has its meaning in GARDE à VUE, leads to nowhere in UNDER SUSPICION; the colourful Carnival has atmosphere, but unfortunately the police precinct has none; and there are many lengthy flashbacks, in which Freeman is inserted as a witness,- a gimmick which soon becomes rather tiring. CHARACTERS. The characters too are treated differently: in GARDE à VUE Michel Serrault is bitterly ironic, rather uncouth, and on the whole unattractive; he never met before stern chief inspector Lino Ventura, who relentlessly strives to establish his guilt; the other inspector is a bully, who beats up Serrault when left alone with him. Romi Schneider comes from a family with a high social position but no money. She willingly admits to Ventura that she married Serrault in her mid-twenties for his money, after having been his mistress for some time and condoning with his sex fancies though she has no physical needs; nevertheless they were happy till the Camille incident (see hereafter), when she shut her door to him; divorce is out of the question, - for the husband because divorce is looked askance at in the town where he has his office, for the wife because she is totally dependent on him for money. Gene Hackman is a more genial suspect, but his rather special tastes regarding very young prostitutes reinforce (rightly or wrongly) suspicion; inspector Freeman shared his youth and has remained in speaking terms with him; however, if the policeman has grounds for suspicion, he is also strongly jealous of Hackman's huge fortune and beautiful wife; he is therefore biased in his judgement - which complicates matters to no avail; the second inspector behaves more in accordance with his chief's politics than in GARDE à VUE, and is less important. Hackman has known his wife since she became an orphan, paid for her studies, and seduced her when she was 14. From the Camille incident on, their marriage has been just a front. THE CAMILLE INCIDENT UNDER SUSPICION uses some of the GARDE à VUE dialogue - unfortunately, often not in situation; more, it is misused in connection with the Camille incident (Camille being the daughter of Serrault's sister in GARDE à VUE, but that of Monica Bellucci's sister in UNDER SUSPICION): on a Xmas night at her niece's home, Schneider enters unexpectedly the dim-lighted dining-room, finds her husband and her niece gazing raptly in the other's eyes, and realizes that they share a universe of their own from which she is excluded and shall never be a part of. She develops an instant hate for her husband. She says later to Ventura \"He had no right to have her gaze upon him like a woman \"; there is no inkling of any improper behaviour. Monica Bellucci goes into Camille's room, finds her very excited, in the company of her rather drunk husband: as she is convinced that he behaved badly, with the girl's consent, uttering the same words as Schneider is nonsense. ABOUT REMAKES What with the number of movies and TV films, the shortage of original stories is unavoidable, and therefore you cannot object to remakes on principle, nor demand that they be carbon copies; but the changes brought must be as least as effective as the abrogated parts: in that respect, making Hackman a photography addict has a use; but other alterations are not so welcome. For instance, Serrault's wife does not want children, and her refusal can explain his unhappiness and attraction towards Camille. In UNDER SUSPICION, Gene Hackman loves children, (his speech leaves no doubt about it\u0085), but he had been married for several years prior to the Camille incident, his wife says she is not sterile, and still they have no child \u0085 no explanation is given hereof. Further, the discovery of the real culprit in UNDER SUSPICION is narrated (rather badly, what is more), not shown, and fails to attract your attention. And the discovery of a third victim, Ventura's admonishment, the ultimate suicide of Romi Schneider and Serrault's despair result in a far more impressive ending than Gene Hackman going back home alone and presumably leaving his wife for keeps. THE CASTS The characters in GARDE à VUE are better delineated and more incisive than in UNDER SUSPICION, and give more opportunities to the actors: if Hackman is excellent, his character is less complex than Serrault's, who fits his to perfection; Freeman's performance is not one of his bests, while Ventura is outstanding as an inspector who fails to remain objective, and whose future accordingly is bleak; Romi Schneider's delicate features and calculating coldness are perhaps more suited to the story than Monica Bellucci's earthly beauty; Thomas Jane has not much to do, while Guy Marchand's sadistic impersonation earned him a Cesar, the French equivalent of Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The Puerto Rican bit-players are non-existent, where all the French ones are good (compare the native commissioner in UNDER SUSPICION, who has no substance and whose warning to Freeman to proceed carefully fall totally flat; on the contrary the French one is established in two scenes as a man of power, incisive and demanding). END OF SPOILERS THE TECHNICAL TEAMS Many of the best directors love to lend a hand in the writing of their movies; such is the case for Claude Miller, co-writing a closely-knit script with Jean Herman prior to directing it, incisively and faultlessly; witty vitriolic dialogue by Michel Audiard and a perfectly suited musical score by François de Roubaix are priceless contributions. The result is a taut fascinating movie which never drifts from the trend of the story. Viewing UNDER SUSPICION, you have the feeling that the writers brought most alterations regardless of their impact, for the sole purpose of justifying their salaries. As to Stephen Hopkins's direction, it is uneven; together with the loose treatment of the plot and its superfluous complications, it fails to ensure the unity required for such a film. CONCLUSION. Those who have not seen GARDE à VUE can be attracted by UNDER SUSPICION 's cast and may find it a slightly better than average thriller; most of the others will judge UNDER SUSPICION the unnecessary",
         "Like SE7EN there is weird (albeit appropriate) music. Like SE7EN there is a jumpy, ADD-inflected title sequence. Like SE7EN this film is dark and dreary, a vision of an ill-lit and illicit milieu, raising far more questions than it answers. And Morgan Freeman is playing yet another world-weary detective, swamped by serial killings. There is even a young, hot-headed cop involved, although Thomas Jane (Detective Owens) is certainly no Brad Pitt. He was so grating in his part that I kept wishing he would get off the screen so the two leads could get at it. And so they do. If in their last appearance together in UNFORGIVEN Hackman's character was tormenting Freeman's, then it is somehow fitting that here it is the latter's Capt. Victor Benezet who interrogates, berates, persecutes and ultimately breaks down the resistance of Hackman's Henry Hearst, an attorney who verily has a fool for a client. Capt. Benezet may position himself as the 'good' cop in the 'good cop/bad cop' scenarios he sets up with Detective Owens, and later, Detective Castillo (Pablo Cunqueiro); but he is ever questioning, ever probing, ever seeking in his interrogations the heart of this dark matter. He is even insinuated into his witnesses' recollections, through a cool cinematographic trick appearing and asking questions in situ in the midst of the film's flashbacks. In spite of interruptions from underlings, superiors, and ultimately Hearst's spouse Chantal (Monica Bellucci in a tight, controlled performance) , over the course of the film one by one the lies and half-truths are stripped away, leaving Hearst with only his moral turpitude and his pitifully sparse self-justifications intact. It is only another interruption from one of Benezet's people that jerks us away from the sleazy, soul-shorn sight. Yet the revelation that follows twists and tears, sending our belief in this story and its implications into a dizzying, perhaps fatal spin. In the ending sequence Chantal and Henry Hearst walk towards each other, but somehow do not connect. They end up sitting apart. In a way that relates to the way UNDER SUSPICION acts upon its viewers. Sorry, no neat, happy ending here. Not even a coherent one.",
         "This is an intense drama that takes place between Gene Hackman as the suspect, Henry Hearst, and Morgan Freeman as Capt. Victor B., mostly in the form of an interrogation at a police station in Puerto Rico. However, it has some interesting scenes that take place outside the police station, while the interrogation is on going - showing us what might have happened. Both Hackman and Freeman do excellent work in this film, as expected of these two pros. Thomas Jane, a good actor, has little to work with in this particular drama, which showcases Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman as the leads. Monica Bellucci plays Chantal, the beautiful young wife of Henry Hearst, however, in my opinion, her acting was only average except for one scene where she is crying. Mostly she is just delicious eye candy. As the interrogation continues, Henry's story keeps changing as Victor hammers away at him about the rape and murder of two young girls, until secret after secret is uncovered and fully revealed much to Henry's humiliation. Just prior to the ending, Henry goes completely out of character, in my opinion, and when we reach the conclusion to the case, it is somewhat disappointing. Other than the somewhat weak ending, however, the film is quite riveting and held my interest entirely, although perhaps it is just a bit overly long for a interrogation format, and does lead at times to some repetition, it is nonetheless a highly entertaining film. 8 stars out of 10"

         "A lawyer is asked to come to the police station to clear up a few loose ends in his witness report of a foul murder. This will only take ten minutes, they say, but it turns out to be one loose end after another, and the ten minutes he is away from his speech become longer and longer...",
         "While San Juan celebrates San Sebastian's Feast, recently-divorced and world-weary police captain Victor Benezet calls in prominent attorney Henry Hearst to clarify his statement about discovering the body of a girl of about 12, the second such murder in two weeks. As Hearst answers unconvincingly, Benezet reveals circumstantial evidence: the lawyer is under suspicion. The interrogation strips away Hearst's dignity, public persona, and even his toupee, exposing a breech with his beautiful and much younger wife, questionable sexual predilections and a damning hobby. Then, Hearst's wife volunteers information that confirms police suspicions. Is Hearst finally at the breaking point?"
