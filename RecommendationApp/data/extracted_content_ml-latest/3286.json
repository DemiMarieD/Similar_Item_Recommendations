      "synopsis": "It's the day children dream of and parents dread: a sudden snowstorm causes the cancellation of school, giving kids a day off and their folks one more thing to worry about. Snow Day traces what happens in an upstate New York town when a thick layer of white stuff forces local schools to take a day off. Fifteen-year-old Hal Brandston (Mark Webber) is crazy about Claire Bonner (Emmanuelle Chriqui), the prettiest girl in his tenth-grade class, who already has a boyfriend -- the class jock and BMOC. Will the magical powers of Snow Day give Hal a chance to win her away? Meanwhile, Hal's ten-year-old sister, Natalie (Zena Grey), is having so much fun with Snow Day that she doesn't want it to end, so she makes sure the Snow Plow Man (Chris Elliott) can't get the roads cleared before morning. Four-year-old Randy Brandston (Connor Matheus) is all cranked up and ready to enjoy life on a day with no day care -- bad news for his mom, Laura (Jean Smart), a businesswoman who has to close an important deal. And weather is a sore spot with father Tom Brandston (Chevy Chase); as the meteorologist at the lowest-rated TV station in town, he is trying in vain to get folks to pay attention to what he has to say about snow, rain, and the elements. Snow Day was produced by Nickelodeon Movies, the feature-film branch of the children's television network, and its eclectic cast also includes Pam Grier, John Schneider, and Iggy Pop. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide",

         "\"Snow Day\" is a good family film that you should watch on a rainy day, or snowy day for that matter. Chris Elliot did a good job as \"the snow plow man\", and the rest of the younger cast was okay. The entertainment was good, and the acting wasn't too bad. In fact, some of the movie was funny. Overall, this is a good rainy Sunday movie. If your'e looking for a entertaining family film, you should rent this. But only take it for what it is. I give this film a 6/7 out of 10.",
         "I first saw this movie at my cottage in 2001 because my little cousins begged to rent it. I groaned because it looked like any other Family Channel movie with cheesy lines, etc. However, I was very wrong. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was recently advertised to be shown on TV again, and I felt nostalgic about it. But, I couldn't help thinking that since I was about 13 when I first saw it, my tastes might have changed, and I would hate it now. Again, I was definitely wrong. This movie can appeal to any age group, because it has plot lines involving a wide range of ages. All the plot lines offer something funny and cute, even if sometimes unbelievable. But with a movie like this, you have to be able to suspend your grasp on reality for a couple hours. If you're looking for a good, light movie to pass some time with, you will not be disappointed by this one. I recommend it to anyone.",
         "Part \"American Graffiti\" (a few hours in the lives of several kids and the adults in their lives), part \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" (fun and life's lessons learned in a day off from school), part \"Groundhog's Day\" (the second film in what I hope will eventually be The Weatherman Trilogy featuring Chris Elliot in quirky roles), and part \"A Christmas Story\" (nostalgia and snow), \"Snow Day\" is a slap stick comedy that doesn't take itself seriously and offers harmless fun. Something for everyone in the family. Chevy Chase and Jean Smart have fairly small roles as the parents but they are a joy to watch. Stories involving younger kids reminded my of \"Our Gang\", the stories involving teens reminded me of \"Ferris Buelle\"r. Rated PG for mischief (say what?), and the word \"butt.\" Emmanuelle Chriqui plays the most popular girl in school who is not only drop dead gorgeous but a girl next door type who is nice to everyone. She makes a terrific role model and it's refreshing to see this aspect of her character, which in most movies would have been written as all out bad.",
         "Key Words: Cute / Kid Flic / So-So There are some belly laughs for the adults in this one, and a plethora of snowball attack and \"fart joke\" situations that the kids in the audience all loved. But the plot was not as deep as the snow, and I longed for some more good situations that could have been worked into the action. All in all it was a light diversion with some cute kids and one nasty, dirty, \"snow-plow man\" that was more comic strip than reality.",
         "This movie has a predictable fairy tale plot. A boy tries to date the most popular girl in school. But another girl tries to get with him. He about to get beat up by the popular girl's boyfriend. But he ends up with the girl that wanted him. Plus a girl wishes for snow and sabotages the snow plower's snow plowing job. Unrealistic. The highlight of this movie was seeing fly Chilli and fly Pam Grier making a cameo. Chris Elliott has been type-casted as a stupid person in every movie that he is in. It is hard for Chevy Chase to top his National Lampoon movies. Any child knows that when it snows, they have to make up snow days on Saturdays, during Spring Break, or at the end of the school year.",
         "I hate to see people meticulously pine over the details of this marvelous film as if it were \"The Last Temptation of Christ\". It's a simple film with heart and hilarity. This film features some of the funniest children actors I've ever seen. It's painfully corny, yes, but a the same time it makes you laugh out loud and feel the characters. Watch this movie. It's pure hilarity and fun.",
         "I had high hopes for this movie before it first came out, noticing that the writers were none other than the masterminds behind \"The Adv. of Pete & Pete\". Having watched it, however, left me feeling underwhelmed. I think for anyone who was (is) a fan of P & P, watching this movie is like watching flashbacks from the show, albeit with less engaging characters and a so-so story. Messrs. McRobb and Viscardi even throw in the obligatory \"slightly annoying sidekick kid named Wayne\" in this movie, which I find to be quite sad.. anyway, here's to Pete & Pete, forever in our collective memories..",
         "I remember seeing this when it first came to video. Even at a young age, I knew something was wrong. The story it told was bizarre. It tries to balance teen-romantic comedy with Home Alone style kiddie hijinks. Those really don't go together. I can see how you can thread together multiple plots and characters during a single day (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World did it perfectly so many years ago), but these filmmakers, and ESPECIALLY Nickelodeon weren't prepared to make something like that work. Chris Elliot's Snowplow Man is also such a hateful character. This was during the time when Chris Elliot was somehow in every comedy movie, because for some reason, everyone thought he was hilarious in There's Something About Mary (that would be half-right). Also, I don't dig Chevy Chase comedy. Not one bit. Snow Day is a conundrum.",
         "Whether you were in first grade, or a senior in high school, one of the most exciting phone calls you could ever get in the wee hours of the morning would be a canned recording of your district's superintendent informing you that school was cancelled for the day due to inclement weather. Living in the suburbs of Chicago my entire life, I vividly remember hearing reports of heavy snowfall that could potentially close schools, and going to bed those nights hoping to whatever God would listen to my ridiculous plea that I wouldn't have to go to school the following day. More often than not, it was wishful thinking on my part, due to the around-the-clock, persistent work of the snowplows, but on occasion, the snow and ice would be so bad that the school buses couldn't get through (the ultimate factor in a district's decision whether or not to close school) and I'd be blessed with great news when I woke up in the morning. These thoughts and memories flourished as I watched Chris Koch's Snow Day, but not because the film was extracting those paradoxically warm and fuzzy feelings, but because I was so disinterested in the characters and the events occurring in the film that the only outlet I had was my overactive, nostalgic mind. This is a film that has the ability to operate like an episode of the underrated Television show Recess, which concerned a group of six schoolage children who tried to do everything they could to live up the thirty minutes of liberation they got every school day. The kids in the show were bright, developed, adamant about sticking together, and clever in their abilities to stay one step ahead of their school administration. The children in Snow Day are a gaggle of underdeveloped and ill-behaved brats that mistake loud, ribald behavior and baffling choices as likability and logical motivations. The film concerns a group of young schoolkids in Syracuse, New York, who do everything they can to keep their school closed after heavy snowfall, which involves stopping the fearless snowplow driver (Chris Elliot) from getting through to plow the streets. One of the kids is Hal (Mark Webber), who spends the day trying to win the heart of his sweetheart Claire Bonner (Emmanuelle Chriqui), with the help of his best friend, Lane Leonard (Schuyler Fisk), who is secretly repressing feelings for him after a lifelong friendship. Then we have Natalie (Zana Grey), Hal's younger sister, and her two friends Wayne (Josh Peck), and Chet (Jade Yorker), who work to stop the aforementioned snowplow driver from plowing the sidestreets leading to the school. Finally, there's Hal and Natalie's father Tom (Chevy Chase), who works as a Television meteorologist, spends the day attempting to cover the record snowfall in a quicker manner than his competitor Chad Symmonz (John Schneider), both of whom fighting for their own job security. The biggest problem with Snow Day is it doesn't have a central focus, despite one pragmatically assuming that the effort to take out the snowplow driver would be the film's primary focus. The issue here is that the film doesn't invest enough time in the efforts to stop said driver, nor does it concoct many setups or provide much development to the idea that would allow one to believe what is actually happening in efforts to stop this man. Snow Day is simply a collection of subplots that make less a movie and more of an anthology film, strung together from comedic odds and ends, never materializing to something of a collective whole. Some of Snow Day's greatest sins could be forgiven if the film was the least bit humorous. Alas, however, Snow Day focuses on the kinds of things people with no knowledge of kids think kids say but never actually do; with that comes a barrage of stale, foreseeable humor and monotonous slapstick that never amounts to anything that is memorable in a long term sense. Even veteran actors like Chase and Elliot cannot save the project with their presence, for their characters have been hamfisted into pure stupidity and childishness beyond what should be acceptable for them as actors. Snow Day is a film bearing very little wit or craft in its writing and its characters. It's more or a less an assembly of parts, characters, situations, and subplots searching for a bigger picture to function in. It's the equivalent of someone dumping a toolbox all over the floor, with wrenches and hammers representing the actors, and the screws, nuts, bolts, and other connective devices representing things like writing, transitions, and characters, and hoping they'll all work together before their eyes and churn out something of untold greatness. Starring: Mark Webber, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Zena Grey, Chevy Chase, Chris Elliott, Schuyler Fisk, Jean Smart, Josh Peck, Jade Yorker, and John Schneider. Directed by: Chris Koch.",
         "Snow Day isn't perfect, but I saw it in grade seven and loved it immediately. Sure it's got the one or two crude humor jokes and sure it's hokey at times, but it's a hilarious adventure about what can happen on a snow day. Hal and Natalie are a brother and sister living in Syracuse with their weatherman father, stay-at-home computer addicted mom and baby brother Randy. The family is dysfunctional; Laura (the mom) is always on her webcam and never looks away from the screen, then gets angry when Randy makes a mess or wants to play with her. Tom (the father) has very low ratings and is constantly in competition with Chad Symmonz, a flashy modern weatherman who viewers all over town love. Randy is a defiant child always getting into things and making messes just for the hell of it. Hal has a fixation on a popular girl from his high school, Claire. Meanwhile, Natalie and her two friends (an overweight boy named Wayne and her best friend Chet) are mad that it's winter and Syracuse is in the middle of a heatwave, meaning there won't be any snow days, much to the joy of their school principal. Natalie wishes on her brother's favorite action figures for a snow day to come by... When Natalie gets her wish, the town suddenly changes. Anything can happen on a snow day, Natalie says, and it can. Laura is about to learn that a family matters more than a laptop screen, Tom is about to find the courage to stand up to Chad Symmonz. Hal is going to discover that his real true love has been right by his side the whole time and Natalie and her friends will finally have the courage to stand up to the evil Snowplowman, the sadistic and somewhat pervy guy who always foils her plans of a perfect day off of school. I had the movie novelization of Snow Day as a kid (I bought it at a second-hand store when I was three). I've gotta say, the movie is much better, I love the animation in the intro, and there are various funny scenes, from Tom knocking over an ice sculpture of Chad to a janitor finding the words Al Martino bites the big one written above a toilet at his skating rink (he dips the cleaning rag in the toilet to get it wet as he cleans away the graffiti). The only thing I just didn't understand was Wayne (the fat kid). Every time he runs, a farting noise plays in the background, it's unnecessary and pretty crude."
