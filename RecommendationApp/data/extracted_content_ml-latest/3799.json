      "synopsis": "The film takes place in the centre of the Orange Islands Archipelago, on the island Shamouti and neighbouring islands occupied by the Legendary Birds, Moltres, Zapdos, and Articuno, who are said to keep the balance of nature in check. An eccentric collector named Lawrence III arrives in the Orange Islands to fulfil an ancient prophecy, now deemed a legend by the locals. The legend is as follows: Disturb not the harmony of fire, ice, or lightning, Lest these titans wreak destruction upon the world in which they clash. Though the waters great guardian shall arise to quell the fighting, Alone its song will fail, thus the Earth will turn to ash. OChosen One, into thine hands bring together all three. Their treasures combined tame the Beast of the Sea. Lawrence believes the Beast of the Sea is the fourth Legendary Bird, Lugia, which dwells in the ocean near the three islands. Lawrence plots to capture Moltres, Zapdos, and Articuno in order to lure out Lugia and add it to his collection. Setting out in his enormous flying fortress, Lawrence approaches Fire Island where Moltres lives and bombs it with blasts of ice. Moltres emerges but is quickly captured by Lawrences unique aerial, electric rings that double as cages. After the opening titles, the story catches up with protagonists Ash Ketchum, Misty, and Tracey as they travel by boat through the islands. They decide to release their Pokémon, but a powerful storm kicks up, sending them miles off course and find themselves off the coast of Shamouti. Team Rocket, a trio of criminals who follow the children to capture Pikachu, are also caught in the storm and crash their Magikarp-shaped submarine into a cliff face. Numerous Pokémon including Pikachu are disturbed by the odd weather and start travelling to the Orange Islands. In Pallet Town, Ashs mother Delia and scientist Professor Oak, also encounter a flurry of bizarre weather patterns. Ash and co. dock on Shamouti and are quickly approached by the locals who are celebrating their annual festival related to the legend. One of the locals Carol recognises the captain of the kids boat Maren, being old friends. Carol was once the festival maiden, which has been taken over by her younger sister Melody, who is not interested by the traditions of the island. When the locals learn Ash is a Pokémon trainer, they celebrate, and an island elder approaches Ash and selects him to be the festivals chosen one as per the legend. Melody gives Ash a welcome kiss, much to Mistys jealousy. Ash and co. attend a party at a temple where Melody appears in her role as the maiden and plays a signature tune on an ocarina. Melody approaches Ash and informs him of his role in the festivities he is to travel to the islands of the Legendary Birds, also referred to as Titans, and collect three glass balls that represent the birds power. He then brings them to the islands shrine where Melody celebrates by playing the song from before, which is associated with Lugia. Ash is eager to go, but Melody tells him to relax and do it the next day. Pikachu has other ideas, stealing Ashs hat and runs out to the dock, followed by Ash and Maren. Team Rocket sail the remains of their submarine to shore but watch Ash and Pikachu race by on Marens boat. Meanwhile, Delia and Professor Oak watch a news report which describes the climate and weather are being effected worldwide and the disturbances centre around the Orange Islands. Oak receives a phone call from fellow scientist Professor Ivy who informs him the Pokémon in her care are acting strangely. Concerned for Ashs safety, Melody decides to go and find him, and is accompanied by Misty and Tracey, with Team Rocket sneaking onboard Melodys boat. Ash, Pikachu and Maren are caught in an ocean storm but manage to make it to Fire Island in one piece. Pikachu races on ahead and Ash follows. Melodys boat is also thrown around in the storm and Team Rocket are sent flying to Fire Island by the strong winds. Ash and Pikachu find the islands shrine in the middle of the dormant volcano, where Pikachu points out the ancient sphere Ash needs, which glows red when Ash pulls it from the shrine. Team Rocket appear, but their motto is interrupted when Melodys boat flies through the air and lands in the volcano. Zapdos suddenly appears and lands in the volcano. Pikachu uses some form of electrical communication to speak with Zapdos, and Meowth translates, with Zapdos proclaiming that he intends on ruling Fire Island in Moltres absence. Lawrences airship arrives and drains Zapdos of its electrical power, capturing it, along with our heroes. Lawrence is surprised but charmed to find he has captured Ash and co., and frees them within the lower half of the ship whilst he goes to capture Articuno. Melody notices an ancient ruin describing the legend and realises it is actually happening. Ash and co. decide to free Moltres and Zapdos to avert the prophecys continuation, using their Pokémon to blow up the cages containing them. However, Moltres and Zapdos attack each other than bring down Lawrences airship, which crashlands on Lightning Island. Ash and co. escape, collecting the second sphere in the process. As the three Legendary Birds clash overhead, Ashs group escape on Melodys boat and are carried across the ocean to Shamouti by a water spout. The boat is flung onto the island, but the children escape before it falls down the cliff face. The children find themselves on the islands shrine where they meet its guardian Slowking, who speaks English. He points Ash to the shrines centre where he places the first two treasures. The Legendary Birds approach the shrine only for the water spout to rise again and reveals Lugia. Lugia battles the other Birds but is defeated and plunges into the ocean. Delia, Professor Oak, and Professor Ivy travel to Shamouti via helicopter with a news crew. Oak explains the theory that because the balance of power between the Legendary Birds has been disrupted, an underwater current has formed and could ultimately flood the planet, revealing that it is the Beast of the Sea rather than Lugia. Ivy comments that the Pokémon are reacting to the climate change and are heading to the Orange Islands by instinct. The helicopter eventually is caught in the storm and crashlands on Shamouti, though the passengers survive. Ash and co. watch the Pokémon gather around the island, and Slowking reveals that the prophecys line about the world turning to ash is not literal but rather the Chosen One is none other than Ash, which everyone. Ash backs away, believing saving the world is beyond him, but Misty, Tracey and Melody encourage him to try anyway. Melody realises the song from the legend is connected to Lugia and plays it on her ocarina, reviving Lugia, who telepathically speaks to them. Lugia tells Ash that he must retrieve the third sphere from Ice Island to end the chaos. Ash is reluctant but his Pokémon rally to his side to aid him. Ash sets off, using a part of Melodys wrecked boat to act as a sleigh, using his Pokémon to pull him safely across the frozen sea with Lugia escorting him. However, Ashs journey is threatened by the Legendary Birds who block his path. Team Rocket utilise a rubber dingy and part of the helicopter to create a hovercraft and pick Ash and Pikachu up, commenting they dont want to the world to end since there would be no one left to steal from. Ash and Team Rocket race across Ice Island until they arrive at the shrine where Ash finds the third treasure. Moltres, Zapdos, and Articuno attack, with the first two rendering Articuno unconscious. With their hovercraft destroyed, Ash, Pikachu, and Team Rocket down the side of the island and are rescued by Lugia. Pursued by Moltres and Zapdos, Team Rocket realise they are dragging Lugia down and sacrifice themselves to let Ash get to Shamouti, but land in the ocean safely. Lawrence sends more of his flying rings to capture Lugia, who uses its Aeroblast attack to defeat Moltres, Zapdos, and Lawrences rings but plunges into the ocean and falls unconscious. Worried about Ash, Misty swims out into the sea and rescues her friends with help from Tracey. Misty and Tracey awaken Ash who makes his way up to the shrine where he is greeted by Melody and Slowking. Ash places the third treasure into the shrine, causing the shrines pillars to crystallise and glowing water to spill out of it. Realising the song is required, Melody joins Ash on the shrine and plays the tune on her ocarina. Accompanied by a full orchestra rendition of the theme, the green water spreads out across the ocean, reviving Moltres, Zapdos, Articuno, and Lugia, and ends the storms. Lugia takes Ash and Pikachu on a flight around the islands with the other Birds, until the underwater current rises from the ocean, taming it as per the legend. As the song ends, the current sinks back into the water and the Birds return peacefully to their islands. Melody collapses to her knees in exhaustion, now embracing the traditions of her island. At sunset, Lugia bids farewell to Ash, complimenting that the fate of the world couldnt have been in better hands before diving into the sea. Delia, Professor Oak, Professor Ivy, and the news crew arrive, with Delia scolding Ash for getting into trouble again. Misty tells her of Ashs heroics, but Delia admits her worries about Ash, particularly with what has happened, but acknowledges he is a Pokémon Trainer and asks him to save the world a little closer to home. Ash agrees and thanks his mother for her support. Elsewhere, Lawrence finds a card of Mew that started off his collection, and he decides to abandon his goals and begin again with just the card. The next day, Team Rocket make it back to the shrine but lament that even though they were heroes, no one saw what they did. Slowking appears, telling them that many people saw what they did, breaking the fourth wall and acknowledges the audiences presence. Team Rocket are thrilled they are not evil after all but fall into bickering about whether or not they should remain in Team Rocket or start a new syndicate, only to realise they would have to steal money to fund one to begin with.",

         "Excuse me if i sound a little choked up. But this movie symbolizes many things. It was the best poke'mon movie made, and it was the last worth wile poke'mon movie made. None is better when it comes to this film's greatness. It had everything i was looking for, including more. Being an AAML(Ash and Misty love) fan, i found it particularly enjoyable from that stand point. The biggest clues about this couple in the 9+ years of the franchise existence is right here in this movie. Of course at the time it was in it's second year of existence. It also contained dramatic twists, and memorable lines that stand out in all poke'mon fan's minds forever. No poke'mon experience comes as good as this movie.",
         "Being a Pokemon fanatic, I was thrilled to see a sequel to Pokemon: The First Movie. Then again, I was sort of skeptical, because the first movie was not as \"adventurous\" as I thought it would be. Also, it is known that sequels tend to be worse than the original film. However, I was proven wrong. This film has better animation, a more detailed plot line, and greater sense of a \"movie\" rather than an extended version of the television series. Even the short, \"Pikachu's Rescue Adventure\" made more sense than \"Pikachu's Vacation\" in the first movie. I know what you all may be thinking, he is probably just some kid who just wants to brag about how good Pokemon is; but the fact is... I'm 20! I can legally walk into a \"R-rated\" movie! But, I would prefer walking into this delightful feature, because sometimes, with all the horror and boring over-dramatic films out there, it feels good to see a cute & funny animated film with a lesson to be learned at the end (which I'm not going to spoil for you). I highly recommend this movie, because nowadays, we all need to feel like a \"kid\" to release us from the stress! So, until a third movie comes out, I'll watch this one some more!",
         "People should Stop Talking trash about this excellent movie. There is adventure and action, comic situations, good morals, adorable characters (PIKACHU & TOGEPI), beautiful animation, super script, suspenseful events, and everything you can think of that makes an all around great movie, even better. It is also a great way to inspire children that they can make a difference, no matter when times are hard. It Also influences kids That friends are the most powerful tool of all, and can help you when you are down, and out. Very, very cool, and Very, Very Exciting. To simply sum up my point, BOTH KIDS AND PARENTS WILL BOTH ENJOY THIS MOVIE!!!!",
         "I for one, and seeing on the internet I am pleased that there are others that are still unashamed pokemon fans out there It really has been so long since I saw the film. I saw the first and loved it and loved this one first, if this one had come out first then the fan base would've remained stronger and not cut the fans in half. Half leaving and half staying. New Pokemon were brought in this film, they came in the first one as well and then after this there were so many it got ridiculous. But as someone hoping to be a filmmaker one day, I plan to make a pokemon film for the devoted unashamed fans just to stand up for us, and put us all to rest. I love the animation in this film, I love Lugias song. I thought it was funny and moving. I better grab this and the first on DVD before the disappear in obscurity",
         "This Pokemon Movie is an extremely great movie. It was humorous, educational, and enriching. This was an extremely well-balanced movie. I laughed out loud at some parts and I shed tears at others. Another added bonus was a free Lugia Pokemon Card with every ticket. I don't understand why people wouldn't like this movie. It has a very clear plot, superb voicing, and tons of action. Any person, Pokemon fan, anime fan, or neither will enjoy this movie to the fullest. Parents, if you're thinking this is just stupid, mind-numbing violence, think again. This movie demonstrates friendship and teamwork and how working together with anyone can save the world. This is clearly the best of the Pokemon films.",
         "Part of the reason for the huge financial success of this movie has to do with all the ads which address Pokemon 2000 as the greatest adventure yet (or something like that). But is it?...not exactly. Pokemon 2000 is entertaining, but it could have been more. Among the things that it lacks are the sense of a journey, the ethereal ambiance of the first pokemon feature, as well as the antagonistic sense of menace which Mewtow provided. On the other hand Pokemon 2000, is probably a better film for a mass audience, because there is more action and humor, but those alone do not make it the great adventure it promises. Unlike the first movie, this one feels a bit short given the type of premise (one hero must save the world from destruction). Naturally this hero is Ash. In the movie however, he does not do anything so incredible. It felt to me like any other character could have been the hero, because if you get the help of an almost invincible legendary pokemon like Lugia, you don't need much skill. If this had been a slightly longer story, with a little more adventure, Pokemon 2000 would be a worthy film, but it's probably good enough for young Pokemon fans.",
         "For some, the Pokemon franchise is an immense joke. The movies, the show, the cards and games are just complete tripe. For others, it's a religion. While I lean towards neither one, I have indeed liked all the main films (Pokemon 1-4) and find them all very enjoyable kids films. This one surpasses the other three by a milestone, however. Not only is this movie a good Pokemon movie or a nice kids film, it's just a very great and fun film over all, in my sincerest opinion. First of all, the story is quite honestly beautiful to boot. I know that might not bide with some, but truly, the whole idea of the legendary Pokemons Articuno, Moltres, Zapdos and Lugia creating a mass destruction that of course our one and only \"chosen one\" Ash can stop and how all the characters interact with the story is amazing. There are eye-catching action scenes as well as gorgeous animation settings, the best being the scenes near the climax at the three legendary bird islands and the ocean waters that Lugia resides in. It's all very breathtaking, regardless of whether you like the movie or not. While all these films are extremely childish in terms of dialogue, what more could you expect? It does the job it's supposed to and does it well. Even the villain is sinister enough to get by and makes you feel empathy for the Pokemon he sets out to conquer. The score of Lugia's song is also a very soothing and wonderful score that overpowers even the whole film; simply beautiful. In any matter, the movie entertains. I like all of the settings mostly; The islands are all unique in their own way and stand out. The villain's blimp is elegant, and the new characters in this film besides the main Ash, Brock and Misty are all very fun; the most fun of all supporting characters in the movies. Basically, if you liked the first, the rest contain exactly all the other attributes except they all vary in terms of professional tact. Like I have stated, this one takes all the characteristics of the Pokemon series to the highest they can go, and I am not ashamed to admit how much I enjoy this film, and have watched it more than once willingly. This movie shows what faith and determination can accomplish; all the films do, and I am proud to own this on old-timey cassette, and won't stutter to say I put it in, lay back, and let myself go from time to time.",
         "Many of those who claim to hate this movie openly admit to hating Pokemon to begin with. As I had said in my comments on \"Pokemon The First Movie,\" you have to go in to the movie with an open mind. If you go see \"Pokemon 2000\" because you were \"dragged in\" by your kids/nieces/nephews/others, you've already decided that you're going to hate it. I'm not saying that you WILL hate it; just that you've DECIDED that you're going to hate it no matter what, just because it's Pokemon. Current Pokemon fans (like me, and I'm 30!) or more open-minded moviegoers will probably like \"Pokemon 2000.\" I was glad that Kids WB decided to go with a more \"theatrical\" score for \"Pokemon 2000.\" Although I would have preferred that more of the Japanese music would have been left in, I think that the orchestral music was more fitting than the bubblegum pop that permeated \"Pokemon The Movie.\" Like most people, I liked \"Pokemon 2000\" more than \"Pokemon The First Movie,\" probably because of the overall brighter feel. I personally loved the first U.S. appearance of one of my favorite new Pokemon, the flowery Bellossom. There are points of the movie that I felt could have been expanded on, but overall, \"Pokemon 2000\" is a fun ride.",
         "Ok, I know that I said in my review of Pokemon: The First Movie that I would wait until a week before the second one was released to order it in Japanese, but I just couldn't hold out any longer. I had to see it, and it's incredibly well done. So, which one do I like better? Truthfully, I don't know. Mewtwo Strikes Back had heart, and this one has a ton of adventure. Of course, since this one is still about five months from being released in the US, I won't summarize it, but I will say that Misty has a little competition. You'll see what I mean. Those of you that didn't like Mewtwo Strikes Back might like this one better. It has a great storyline, very likeable characters, and a beautiful music score. Hopefully this time, Kids WB will do better in the translation and keep the original music (except, of course, for the theme song). However, looking at their start on this movie (naming it Pokemon the Movie 2000), the future for this dub doesn't seem very promising. Hopefully, they know what they're doing this time.",
         "I have always enjoyed pokemon from the animated series to anything else. So as you can guess, this movie was ,for me and maybe many others, really great. The movie starts out with a typical mini-movie starring Pika chu and some of the pokemon he is friends with. And in this adventure, the whole poke-gang(as I will call them for now) end up falling down some giant hole in order to rescue their friend, Togpei. Anyways, we see bunch of new pokemon that have yet to be seen and some real cute dance scene performed by the Bellossom and other accompanying pokemon. Then,finally the group finds the lost togepi with a nest of exeggcute who have become very attached to him and won't let him go. Then suddenly tragedy hits as a huge eletrical storm breaks out and the pokemon must work together to keep the exeggcute nest safe. Finally, the storm ends and it's time for our poke-gang to go home. But, before that we get to see the lost brother from the exeggscute nest be returned by a random Chansey and they evolve into Exeggutor. (Yep, get it exeggcute = execute, exeggutor= executor) Well, I will admit this part of the movie is nice and cute. But, I will have to admit not having the narrator like they do in most of these mini-movies is kind of nice. it allows the pokemon to speak for themselves through their actions. Now for the actual movie, I personally loved the majority of the movie despite how bad the jokes were. I love seeing Ash at age ten being a strong and impetuous braggart that he can be still pull off actually saving the world. And yes, I know that Misty can be very bland even for a female character. But, I love seeing a likable female character. She may not scream girl power per se. But, she is the ten year old girl in all of us. In this movie, she does the typical female protagonist thing where she hides her true feelings from the male antagonist. I like the part where she says \"He is a boy, and he is my friend. But, he is not my boyfriend\". But, she does change towards the end and goes to help Ash when the other female co-star offers to do it. Next the members of team Rocket, I like them in this movie because they do actually help and was funny how they actually get some recognition compared to the other movies. Even though, they do supply the majority of the bad jokes. Now,my rating for this movie was a seven because I could see how hard they worked to get the sheer awesomeness in the artwork and the music was great. And I have to admit that seeing movie that was not CGI or had a bunch of adult innuendos put in it was nice. Now, my only complaint I had with it was the generic anime style action to it. It was the power of oneness to all of it. And the message was kind of confusing. It was between the environmental message and the the power of one. And it kind of seemed the movie was making a decision between whether of the two go with. And finally what was with having the collector make that statement toward as if we were going to see him again. Well that it for this week. See ya!"
