         "This is a rather mild and forgettable comedy, but I think it deserves a **1/2 rating, if only because it dares to deal with some ambiguous subjects (like vigilantism) without become overly moralizing. The viewer is allowed to think (or not think, if he does not wish to) for himself. It's not a funny movie, I'll grant you that, and Jack Lemmon is thoroughly wasted, but it's an interesting one nonetheless.",
         "Penny Marshall produced this? Harvey Miller, who wrote \"Private Benjamin,\" wrote this? Lemmon, Aykroyd, Hunt, and the incomparable LILY TOMLIN agreed to work on it? Tasteless, unfunny, painful to watch. Whatever moral point they were trying to make, and whatever humor they were trying to achieve, this film just... just hurt. Hurt my eyes, and hurt the reputations of all involved. I'm embarrassed for all involved, and chagrined that I felt I had to watch to the end, to justify writing a review to warn others. Fifteen minutes would have been more than enough.",
         "Maybe it's just because I like Dan Aykroyd: I have never seen a movie with him that I did not enjoy. I decided to put in a few lines of appreciation for this one, considering the bad reviews read here. It certainly is not the ultimate masterpiece of comedy but I found it thoroughly enjoyable, and despite the fact that I was very tired it kept watching it until 2am.",
         "A true comedy if i've ever seen one is this picture. IT vill warm your hearth with warmth and joy. After seeing it 10 times it never gets bored, which is amazing to say the least. Jack lemmon the bitter old sour lemmon that he is, was offcourse perfectly cast as the nazi-loving teacher. The rest of the cast could easily been awarded with an award of some sorts. Maybe a golden trash can or something. In case you were wondering : watching this crap will make your eyes bleed. Have a nice day",
         "I got quite a lot of chuckles out of this movie. But does that make it a really good flick? Not necessarily. It's better than most people say it is (well, the few people who've seen it). Hell, I figured \"Jack Lemmon's in the cast. How bad can this movie be?\" Dan Aykroyd's career definitely isn't as successful as it was in the seventies--his SNL days. I still think he's very talented, but like Chevy Chase he's starting to fall into that ditch with other has-been SNL alumni of the seventies. Lily Tomlin is another veteran comic, but let's face it--what was the last big movie she was in? I love Dan and Lily, but they're two people who wouldn't surprise me if they were to do a bad movie, despite their talents. But actually, this isn't a bad movie at all. People may criticize the subject matter involving Nazi Genocide, but I'm flexible when it comes to comedy. I have a pretty dark sense of humor myself, and I don't mind dark humor at all and believe that almost anything can be made funny if handled in the right manner. \"All in the Family\" is one of the most successful sitcoms of all time, and the show constantly dealt with the subject of racism. There are a good deal of funny moments, though worthy of chuckles and not laughs. But the movie just lacks a certain energy. I can't point out exactly what could've been done better, but the film just has a bland feeling to it. It needed more bite. The acting is great, though. Aykroyd gives an enthusiastic performance. Lemmon performs the same way he would in any of his Oscar-winning films. And Tomlin is impressive as well, in a role that requires her to be somewhat dramatic and not the goofball she usually plays. So basically, what we have is a first-rate cast in a second-rate movie. As I said, not a bad movie--just needed more bite. My score: 6 (out of 10)",
         "Picked this up at Hollywood Video for four obvious reasons: Aykroyd, Tomlin, Lemmon, and the always lovely Bonnie Hunt. But holy cow, what a waste of talent. Lemmon is given nothing to do, Hunt's role is superfluous, and Tomlin's role isn't funny. Aykroyd is in virtually every scene, but since the writers didn't bother coming up with anything funny for him, he becomes tiresome after about fifteen minutes. I have no idea why this movie was made.",
         "I'm only reviewing this because of all the bad reviews. I gave it a 7 though I may change it to a 6 later. I really don't see why people had such a major problem with this movie. It was fun. \"You call this justice?!?!?!\" Basically, don't go into the movie expecting some crazy comedy with an intricate plot line. This movie is just a light-hearted movie to have a few laughs though; no masterpiece, but certainly not a 3.4 either. (That's what it was rated when I wrote this review.)",
         "I bought this movie for one reason and one reason only, Bonnie Hunt. I can not believe she sank so low! Her character is the only good thing about this film, and I hate to say it, her character isn't that great! This movie was the worst thing I had ever seen! Usually Lilly Tomlin is funny, she wasn't. and I was so suprised at Jack Lemmon's character too. Why did you people make this movie? WHY?!?!?! This Movie will forever sit on my shelf never to be watched again!",
         "Despite having a cast that included Dan Aykroyd, Jack Lemmon, Lily Tomlin, and Bonnie Hunt, Savoy Pictures barely released \"Getting Away With Murder\" to theaters. Watching it, I think I can see why. With the movie centering around someone accused of being a Nazi war criminal - and being a comedy - a more sure hand was needed to make this subject material palatable. As it is, the movie is too soft, when it needed to be more biting, like how the Mel Brooks movie \"The Producers\" was with its own Nazi material. But there are other problems than just with a wrong tone. Long stretches of the movie go by without any attempts at humor. There are several moments when scenes appear to be missing, though at the same time the movie also feels stretched out when its telling should have been tighter. I admit I kept watching to see how things would be wrapped up, but the movie cops out in this area as well, leading to a final moment that will have you saying, \"That's IT?!?\" out loud. If you do watch this movie, see if you can figure out why this was given an \"R\" rating - the movie really feels more like a PG-13 or even a PG movie.",
         "Dan Akroyd usually isn't very good by himself, but he did a good job on this movie. It's sardonically funny, and won't make you split your sides laughing, but it is entertaining and provides a good, non-mainstream movie that's more about the line between right and wrong than about getting a laugh, which it does anyway. The daughter is rather comical in her stoicness and reminds me of what Frau Farbinssina would be if she were less obnoxious. The older couple later in the movie is hysterical, but are not included enough in the later events. I wanted to see more of them. The movie as a whole needed more comic relief, since Akroyd himself is not amazingly funny, but he's far from some of the Hollywood idiots running around today doing anything for a cheap laugh. Humor that requires you to think and pay attention."
