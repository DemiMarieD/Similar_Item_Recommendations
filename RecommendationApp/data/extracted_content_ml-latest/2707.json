      "synopsis": "Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is a college history professor at George Washington University who has been raising his nine-year-old son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), since the death of his FBI agent wife, who was killed in the line of duty in a scene loosely based on the real-life Ruby Ridge incident. Somewhat of a specialist regarding American terrorism and due to teach a class on terrorism at the university, Michael starts to become suspicious of his new suburban neighbors, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), whom he's just met after taking their son, Brady (Mason Gamble), to the emergency room following a reported fireworks accident. At first his suspicions are based on little things such as Oliver's architectural blueprints that seem to be for something other than the shopping mall he claims he's building, as well as pieces of mail that contradict where Oliver said he attended college. Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories. After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16. William/Oliver confronts Michael over his looking into William's past. He reveals that 'Oliver Lang' is the name of his friend, who died in a hunting accident. William's family had owned a farm but it went broke because the government 'appropriated' the river that ran through it 'for other uses'. As a result the crops died and they could not raise any animals. William's dad then killed himself and made it look like a tractor accident so the family could claim the life insurance. He left a note for William explaining everything. He built the pipe bomb to get back at the government. When William's friend Oliver died he took his name the next day to hide his past. This makes Michael think twice about what he had found out. Michael continues to uncover what could be possible evidence and becomes even more wary of Oliver and Cheryl. Michael's girlfriend, Brooke, casually spots Oliver and follows his car after witnessing a suspicious package delivery in a garage. Her trail ends up in the headquarters of a mail delivery company from where she decides to call Michael and leave a message, finally accepting his fears as founded; unfortunately, after hanging up, she turns around and stumbles on Cheryl, who had obviously heard the whole message. Brooke's murder (which happens off-screen) is covered up by making it look like Brooke died in a car crash. Michael realizes this after finding out, a few days later, that at least two voice messages were left in his answering machine and then erased by someone else (how is never explained). He tells Carver that Lang may have been involved in her death, and is going to get proof by traveling to St. Louis to talk to a terrorist's father, Arthur Scobee. Scobee's son blew up an IRS building five years ago (a thinly veiled version of the Oklahoma City bombing), killing himself and eight children in the process. It becomes obvious that Scobee was set up. Another clue leads Faraday to suspect that his son may be in danger when he talks with Scobee's distraught father and learns that Scobee was involved in a Boy Scouts-style organization and that he knew the head taskmaster... a person that Oliver also knows. Eventually the conspirators use a field trip with a Scouts-style organization to keep Faraday's son Grant as an unknowing hostage. Faraday confronts Oliver while he is throwing a party, where Oliver finally reveals that he indeed is a terrorist and is plotting something big within a few days and orders him to keep quiet about what he and his group are plotting to do. Growing more desperate, Faraday learns about the origins of two phone calls made to his house that were erased; one being from Carver and the other from Brooke which was made from a payphone at a local shopping center. Faraday rents a car the next day and after sneaking out of his house, goes looking for leads when he spots a van that his son is in. While following the van, Oliver Lang appears and rams into Faraday's car and begins to beat him up. After getting into a fistfight with Oliver in an old building, Faraday bests him and tries to help him understand that killing hundreds of people won't make a difference. When Oliver refuses to call off the bomb and lets it slip that the van is on their way to the FBI building, the frantic Faraday has to stop it before it's too late. In a harrowing chase sequence, Faraday, in a clear panic, drives through the crowded streets of Washington DC and forces his car into the secure parking garage of the FBI federal building, only to discover that he has followed the wrong van into the parking garage. Attempting to calm Faraday, Whit Carver informs him that he is the only person not cleared to be in the garage. Realizing his mistake too late, Faraday rushes to the trunk of his rental car, opening it to reveal.... a hidden bomb just seconds before it explodes, killing Faraday, Whit, and 182 others. Posthumously, Faraday is vilified as a terrorist who destroyed the FBI headquarters under the motive of seeking revenge for his wife's death. The Langs and their conspirators (some of whom include the Scout taskmaster, a telephone maintenance man, and at least one of Faraday's students) completely get away with it. Grant, now orphaned, ends up living with relatives, not knowing of his father's innocence. After the Langs decide to move out of the neighborhood, Cheryl suggests to Oliver that they should go \"someplace nice, someplace safe\"... strongly implying that sooner or later they will strike another government target elsewhere, as well as find another fall guy to take the blame for their evil actions as they did with Arthur Scobee, and Michael Faraday... whom was just their latest victim among so many.",

         "Contrary to what you may think initially, nothing happens by coincidence on `Arlington Road.' Outstanding performances by Jeff Bridges (As Michael Faraday) and Tim Robbins (Oliver Lang) highlight this taut thriller about terrorism in America, a disturbing film instilled with a sense of loss, fear and paranoia. Director Mark Pellington perhaps does not mine this vein to the depths, but there is still a silver lining in this movie, which contains elements of two of Alfred Hitchcock's classics, `The Man Who Knew Too Much,' and `North By Northwest.' Had this film been made forty years ago, in fact, Hitchcock would have been at the helm and we would have had James Stewart instead of Bridges and Richard Widmark in place of Robbins. When Jeff Bridges stars in a thriller, you can usually bet that the project is going to be a cut above the average fare of the genre, and this one is no exception, arguably his best of it's kind since `Jagged Edge.' This is a riveting film, and the tension builds steadily throughout as we uncover, along with Faraday, the dark secrets which ultimately lead to an explosive climax. The excellent supporting cast includes Joan Cusack, Hope Davis and Robert Gossett. A trip to `Arlington Road' is a jolt to the senses and may cause you to stop and rethink a few things about your life. At the very least, you're going to want to finally meet that neighbor who moved in across the street last year. I rate this one 8/10.",
         "It seems like every year, there's one or two films which are far from perfect but nonetheless shake us up in ways better films don't quite do. Last year, it was BULWORTH, and this year, it's ARLINGTON ROAD. Obviously, after all that's happened this decade in America, from Waco to Oklahoma City, the time is ripe for a movie to explore the cracks in the American dream which brought about events like those. This film ultimately asks more questions than it answers, but that may just be a condition inherent to this type of film. More troubling is two things: (1) Though I agree with those(and I'll try not to give away too much here) who theorize the ending changes the whole perspective of the film, there are still too many key narrative cheats(a conversation Robbins supposedly had with Bridges' son seems unbelievable, and the traffic light scene near the end also is) to make it fully effective; (2) The film seems a little confused of what it's about; it is a study of one man's psyche, or the nation's? Still, ARLINGTON ROAD shouldn't be dismissed. There are troubling questions explored, and you don't have to be a conspiracy nut to believe those so-called \"fringe\" hate groups are entering the mainstream at a frightening rate for a so-called \"civilized\" society. The ending is also powerful, and though I understand it, more than anything else, was responsible for the delays, I applaud whoever was in charge for not changing it(though again, how they got there is another story). Bridges' performance is another thing which makes more sense once you look back with the ending of the film in mind, and it doesn't seem like over-acting. Robbins is a little more problematic; there are scenes where he's convincing, and then scenes where he goes over-the-top and shouldn't. Hope Davis doesn't have a big part, but she injects a lot into it as usual. But the biggest surprise here is Joan Cusack. Anyone who thinks of her only as a (good)comic actress will be in for a shock; there's one scene involving her which is the scariest in the film. Again, ultimately, while it leaves you with nagging doubts about the quality, ARLINGTON ROAD makes you think enough to recommend it.",
         "\"Arlington Road\" is the perfect example for how thrillers should be made. A good story, a good atmosphere, good actors and voila! you have got a good thriller. \"Arlington Road\" has got it all and it's a near perfect movie that is a must see for the thriller fans. The intense beginning sets the mood for the rest of the movie. It's atmospheric and tense right till the good ending. I'll admit that there are some slow moments and some distracting plot lines but it doesn't take away the tension or ruins the atmosphere in any kind of way. The movie is very well casted with Jeff Bridges as the more and more paranoid getting Michael Faraday and Tim Robbins as his neighbour that he begins to suspects of being a terrorist. Both main actors pull of really well and help to created the good thriller atmosphere that this movie has. Good thriller with a great atmosphere, story, actors and ending that will stay with you forever. 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
         "Bridges plays the same character as always, but fits nicely into this part. Robbins plays a very back stage part for most of the film, the main concentration is on the small minded paranoia of Bridges. Brilliant film which brings home some harsh, hard truths about American society and security. An interesting storyline, which excels beyond the average Hollywood thriller, the typical guessing game of the goodies and baddies plays a secondary role to the real story. A uniquely intelligent terrorist thriller from Hollywood. Don't miss it.",
         "*****PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW******** ******DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!******** In real life, successful plans (especially military ones) allow for things going wrong, things not happening in the right order, unexpected events and unreliable information. The 'Fog of War' is a major factor in any situation, even with today's technologies. Clever plans have a great amount of tolerance built-in, so they can be changed to fit current circumstances as parts of them succeed or fail, especially when you have little direct control over the situation. Not so for Robbins' character's terrorists. - Bridges' character beats up Robbins' badly enough so he feels comfortable leaving him alone but not so badly that he's unconscious. This is all part of the plan, we find out. How could Robbins' character rely on not being either restrained, knocked out, taken to the police or even killed by Bridges' character? - Bridges' character spends just long enough fighting Robbins' for a bomb to be securely planted in his car, but is in a hurry enough to leave a live and unrestrained Robbins. How could Robbins' character possibly plan for this? - Bridges' character, a civilian academic in a disturbed state of mind, has enough stunt driving skills to speed through acres of pedestrians in the middle of rush hour, so that he'll just see the noon delivery van disappearing into the FBI building. If he misses the van or arrives before it, or if the van itself isn't on time, the bomb won't get into the building. - In real life he would have wrecked the car (and maybe damaged or set off the bomb) or been stopped by the police before he was a quarter of the way to the FBI building. - What if Bridges had parked his car outside and gone in the building by foot? - Bridges character HAS ALREADY PHONED the FBI building to warn them about the bomb BEFORE he sets out. Why didn't Robbins' terrorists break his mobile phone when they planted the bomb in his car? - Why didn't the FBI building close its gates after the warning? Surely they would have at least stopped the white delivery van Bridges' character specifically tells his Agent friend to investigate. - Why the heck is Robbins' character trying to convince the world it's the work of a crazy individual anyway? How does that draw attention to or advance his cause? - Worst of all, why does Robbins' character embark on an elaborate six month charade of dinner parties, psychological warfare, deliberately injured children, campsite kidnappings, faked car crashes, hidden blueprints, hostage taking, phone tapping, name changes, car exchanges, etc etc? All he has to do is deliver a briefcase sized bomb fifty yards past a small checkpoint. Couldn't he have driven it himself? Couldn't he have abandoned a parked car just outside the building with a larger bomb in it instead? No one would ever devise a plot anything like Arlington Road except a thriller writer desperate to keep the viewer amused. This is why the film should never have been made, because it wraps a brainless mediocre piece of entertainment in the bodies of the 149 adults and 19 children who died in the Oklahoma massacre. It is exploiting a recent real-life atrocity purely for the sake of making money and selling videos. Death = $$$$. It's obscene, and worst of all some people will think this is how terrorists operate in real life. Real terrorists leave arabic flight manuals in hire cars and tell instructors they're not interested in how to land an aircraft, but still manage to kill 3000 people in one day. That's what's really frightening.",
         "ARLINGTON ROAD (1999) ***1/2 Starring: Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis, Mason Gamble, and Robert Gossett Director: Mark Pellington 117 minutes Rated R (for intense violent content and some language) By Blake French: \"Arlington Road\" is this year's \"Breakdown.\" It's filled to the rim with hard core, high octane tension and suspense-so much that it is almost hard to catch your breath throughout the movie's running period. Fueled with first rate performances and a script that is understandable and clear, this may be one of the best thrillers. The movie starts off with a boy, named Brady Lang, who stumbles down Arlington Rd. with blood dripping from his body. Jeff Bridges, who plays Michael Faraday, a single professor who teachers a course on terrorism at a local university, observes this terrified and injured child from inside his car as he drives by. After realizing the nature of his wounds, he dashes out of his car to help. Michael rushes Brady to the nearest hospital, in result he saves his life and meets some people whom he will soon wish he would have never laid eyes on. Wow. What an exhilarating opening scene. While it may be a little over the top, it does provide the setup needed for such the brutal, bloodthirsty film this really is. It is not a film for younger viewers, and I would check into it some more if you're faint of heart or squeamish in any way. This movie takes itself seriously for every second of the way, unlike many other \"scary\" movies out there today. Brady Lang belongs to a new family down the block from the Faraday's, consisting of Oliver, the friendly dad, Cheryl, almost eccentric wife, and their children, who are very bizarre acting. Quiet and suspicious, almost as if they are holding something back. When Michael and his girlfriend, Brooke, meet the Lang's, they introduce them to his son, ask them over for dinner sometime, and look around their new house. Oliver is an architect currently working on a shopping mall somewhere out of town. But wait! When Michael was over there last he saw the blueprint to his \"so called\" mall, and knows that this is no mall he his constructing. This makes Michael very wearily of his neighbors, especially when he beholds Oliver's mail and discovers that there may have been a name change sometime ago in Lang's past. He brings these things to the attention to Brooke, only to have her call him paranoid and that his occupation is getting to his head. That is also what his old buddy, FBI Agent Whit Carver, says to him when Michael asks him to do a background check on Oliver. Things really heat up when Michael discovers the truth behind his friendly neighbor's secret identity. Movie posters and newspaper ads suggest it. Previews and reviews reveal it, and by the time the film takes an unexpected turn in the third act, the only one suspecting Oliver Lang to be just an ordinary person is Michael. \"Arlington Road\" is smart enough to develop Jeff Bridge's character with feelings, flashbacks and an emotional past, rather than showing us the details of his past marriage. It is also smart enough not to develop a romantic subplot between Michael and Brooke, beyond the suggestions and interest in each other. It stays on track every inch of the way; all the scenes further the plot a little bit at a time. Leading us with a perfectly structured, flawlessly planned out thriller. The performance by Jeff Bridges is so great and certainly Oscar worthy we actually buy into the paranoia plot and end up caring about him so much this movie's ending actually hurts to watch. It ruins the entire production. The last twenty minutes of this movie arrant just unbelievable, but the closing scene features a sense of injustice, unfairness, and is unsettling beyond comprehension. All of this and I still have not revealed the actually end to you, and will not. But I hated it, and think the majority of an audience will join me in saying as the closing credits arouse on screen their jaw dropped off their face and hit the floor. However, I do think the film is unconventional because of the thematic structure it used for its closing and subject madder. If it would have concluded in a predictable, usual fashioned people would complain about that too. It proves how much we care about the characters. And at the same time allows us to realize that this film deserved better, somewhere down the road, it deserved to be much better.",
         "This is a nifty suspense story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I was craving some ice cream as we watched it but couldn't tear myself away until it was over. (And I love ice cream!) And the ending is, well, intriguing. It got a little silly in spots but overall it's a dandy nail biter with solid acting, great direction, creative camera work and a taut script. I gave it an 8.",
         "I have watched this twice, and despite its many flaws, I thought this movie was dynamite. This movie has the most effective opening sequence ever. The pulsating techno score, the giddy camerawork, if this movie didn't have that opening, I would have given Arlington Road a 7 instead of a 8.5. The movie had excellent, if sometimes overracted performances, particularly from Jeff Bridges, but I'll give special mention to Joan Cusack, her performance was chilling. Tim Robbins, was disappointing. He doesn't cut it as the villain. He was excellent in Jacob's Ladder, but here doesn't make the grade. The script faltered sometimes, towards the end (But not the ending), because it grew a bit confusing. However the dialogue was excellent and always realistic. The direction was outstanding. I could see no flaw in the direction. The cinematography was also excellent, the editing, too. And the music, just fabulous. I'd like to discuss the ending. After seeing the commercial for this movie and reading the reviews, I knew there was going to be a big, surprise ending. Then how come I predicted the ending to occur? But in a movie like this it didn't matter. Just sit back, and enjoy this for the acting, direction, music and cinematography. And if you don't predict it, the ending will be a big, satisfying surprise for you. 8.5/10.",
         "Man, this was one overrated movie. Found it hard to watch, and I have to include SPOILERS to say way. From the camera moves to the music to the acting, this thing was so O!V!E!R!D!O!N!E! I couldn't stand it. Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors, but here he's such an over the top loon that I had no sympathy for him. And I never bought that his discovery of the plot started when he saw a small part of a blueprint that's hidden under stuff on a kitchen table! He saw this for what, 4 seconds? And didn't it bug anybody that the bad guys showed up at such convenient times, as if they had ESP? Jeff reads microfilm about Tim in a library, and voila, Tim is at the library looking over Jeff's shoulder! Jeff reads Tim's old yearbook then falls asleep, and voila, he wakes up and Tim is there! Jeff's girlfriend is at some anonymous mall out in the middle of nowhere, spilling her guts to his answering machine about bad guy Tim, and voila, she turns around and Tim's wife is there! It's these logic problems and the over the top style that make this film unwatchable.",
         "This is an awful movie. I have never seen so many plotholes in a movie that takes itself seriously. I hardly ever say that a movie was a waste of my time, but this time there is nothing else I can do: Arlington Road is a complete waste of anyones time!! SPOILERS: It's the intention of Oliver Lang, that Michael Farraday will go to the pay phone, sees the truck, realizes that this truck has got something to do with his son, follows the truck, DOES NOT GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE DURING HIS CHASE (!), sees his son, gets away from his car, goes back to his car, knows where the bombing will take place, IS ABLE TO GET IN THE BUILDING (!)(despite the fact that this is a highly guarded building, and that Farraday doesn't have permission to enter it). Every one of these actions could NOT have been predicted this accurate. And these are just a very few of the many, many unbelievable things in this movie."

         "Widowed when his FBI agent wife is killed in an operation against suspected terrorists, a college professor becomes increasingly obsessed with the culture and sub-society of these dangerous groups. The arrival of new neighbors, gives him new spirit, as they are gregarious and friendly, with a ten-year-old boy that his son can be friends with. He is even beginning to see another woman. However, he begins to suspect something is odd about the neighbors, something about the way they don't want him to see certain parts of the house, or a set of blueprints they have there. Are his neighbors terrorists... or is the stress of losing his wife merely driving him past the point of paranoia?",
         "Michael Faraday is a recently widowed college history professor living alone with his ten-year-old son Grant in the suburbs of Washington, DC. The death of Michael's wife Leah, an FBI agent killed in the line of duty, continues to haunt both father and son. Michael and Grant are soon befriended by the Langs, a vivacious, All-American family new to the neighborhood. The parents, Oliver and Cheryl Lang, go out of their way to draw Michael into their lives. Soon, Grant and young Brody Lang become inseparable friends. The Faradays' long period of mourning seems finally to be over. As the two families become closer, Michael begins to have misgivings about the gregarious Oliver. After catching Oliver in a few insignificant lies, the more Michael learns about Oliver, the more his uneasiness grows. With Grant spending more and more time at the Langs, Michael decides to check into the background of his neighbors. What he discovers deepens the mystery, arousing suspicions that shake Michael to the core of his existence. The Langs are definitely not who they claim to be; but who are they? Why have they come to Washington, DC?",
         "When Michael Faraday, single father, accidentally stumbles across a little lie from his new neigbour, he gets suspicious. As a university professor who gives classes on terrorism history and whose wife got killed in the line of FBI-duty, his fatherly protection instincts arise much faster than in normal people. Grant, his son, became the best friend of Brady Lang. Only that Brady's father did not always carry the name Lang. Digging deeper and deeper, Michael Faraday excavates a very interesting and frightening history. But what we didn't think of: From whose point of view is that history frightening?",
