         "In 1957, Roger Vadim caused a sensation and turned Brigitte Bardot into an international sex symbol with his scandalous film about a pouting, sexually uninhibited young woman who's got 'it' and knows how to flaunt 'it'. Scenes of Brigitte *almost* naked, and memorably gyrating on a table to the tango, pushed the censors to their limit, and delighted male audiences all over the world! Thirty year later Vadim attempted to repeat the success, and in Rebecca De Morney found a stunning actress worthy of comparison to Bardot. Sadly, it turned out to be a forgettable, surprisingly tame film, updated into a story about a girl with ambitions of getting out of prison and finding fame in a rock 'n' roll band. (Although after you've heard a few of their soft rock anthems, you may wish she was back behind bars). As in the original, the heroine strings a few men along, all useful to her in different ways, but this time she's no tease, just a brisk, modern woman with a career, keeping her men at a distance by turning hot and cold on them as it suits her. As has been noted, there is ONE scene worth catching early on - Rebecca and Vincent Spano's 'brief encounter' in the prison gym. In the scene, Rebecca's breakout attempt has been foiled, and she needs to break back IN, but while changing back into her prison clothes she's spotted - naked - by a young prison carpenter (Spano). They hear some guards coming, and he helps hide her safely out of the way. In silence, Spano looks at the naked beauty before him (full-frontal De Morney! Wow!!), and she looks back with a mixture of gratitude and sexual hunger, and soon they're getting it on against the wall. This is the hottest sex scene of Rebecca's career!! There are a couple more later on - one on a pool table where she pushes Frank Langella's head between her thighs (nice work for some!), and one in bed, bumpin' 'n' grindin' naked on top of Spano (and revealing a figure in a million!) - but the one in the gym is the best. Vadim had hoped this might do for De Morney what the original did for Bardot, but the film turned out to be a box-office dud, and she'd have to wait a few more years before her chilling performance in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle finally saw her deservedly hit the big time.",
         "In New Mexico, the prisoner Robin Shea (Rebecca De Mornay) has an intercourse with the simple carpenter Billy Moran (Vincent Spano) and in order to get her probation, she proposes him US$ 5,000.00 to get married with her for one year. Billy accepts, expecting to have sex with her, but she does not include this type of service in their deal. Meanwhile, she uses and is used by a powerful politician, James Tiernan (Frank Langela), who is trying to be elected the next governor of New Mexico. What a corny movie is this \"And God Created the Woman\"! The story is quite ridiculous and the flick is worthwhile only due to the sexy body of Rebecca De Mornay, always naked or half naked. My vote is five. Title (Brazil): \"E Deus Criou a Mulher\" (\"And God Created the Woman\")",
         "One thing I've always admired about 80's movies is that they all have that \"Miami Vice look\". The groundbreaking show featured hip clothing for the time as well as lots of music playing (hits or otherwise) when there was no dialogue. Today, we don't have that in films or T.V., but in the last great decade, it was everywhere. I've wondered if there ever was a true 90's movie? And God Created Woman continues this trend. This film was made during the \"hip\" trend of the late 80's, when people gave up their feathered mullets and ugly tank-tops and started wearing the suits, hats, and skinny ties that were in style. The ladies would wear acid-wash jeans and what-not. This story is a different version of the original Bardot film that made Roger Vadim a star. In this one, Rebecca De Mornay plays Robin Shea, a convict who wants to make it big as a rock 'n roll star. However, she is doing time for something and she has to wait for her parole. The story that unfolds is the kind of unbelievable pap that came out in the 50's but is set in the 80's. It's just a fairy tale. The story is too mundane to even explain, because you've seen it before. I will say that the acting is mediocre at best. Only Vincent Spano, who plays a decent guy who ends up in cahoots with De Mornay delivers a good performance. Frank Langella sleepwalks his way through his role as a prospective candidate for the governship of New Mexico who also gets involved with De Mornay. De Mornay herself is very cute, but plays a rogue who nobody would approve of. Everyone else is just a cardboard extra. The soundtrack is decent (all movies came out with a soundtrack, it seemed). All in all, not good, but better than the crap coming out today, I guess.",
         "I couldn't stop laughing, this could easily become a cult classic for it's over the top writing, acting, music, everything. There were some hotter erotic scenes that were probably the only reason anyone ever watched the entire film. So predictable and ridiculous that it's one chuckle after another, so I guess I enjoyed it a little, but most likely not for the same reasons the film was made. Apparently I need to write 10 lines of text to be considered a full review, I thought I summed it up in 2 sentences. This movie has no direction, it wants to be too many things and ends up nowhere. My only comment on De Mornay is that although she had her moments, on stage and being sultry, it seems to me she has about as much talent as most strippers. This film is basically a failed attempt at anything, and a disgrace to the original.",
         "Probably one of the worst movies of the 1980's, 'And God Created Woman' stars Rebecca De Mornay as Robin, a prison inmate who convinces the prison handyman (Spano) to marry her for a large sum of money so she can get released on parole. When she's out, they move in together and don't get along. Robin starts a rock-band, hoping to fulfill her life long dreams of becoming famous. Soon Robin catches the eye of local senator James Tiernan, and they eventually have an affair. As Robin's new found freedom is put in jeopardy, she must do whatever she can to remain free, while not hurting the man she really loves. If there was ever a movie looking for a point, this is it. The movie has no direction, it wants to be too many things and ends up nowhere. There are prison breaks, gratuitous sex, family squabbles, political banquets, and rock bands. The writing in this is so over the top I had a hard time figuring out if this movie was intended as a drama or a comedy. Hack director Roger Vadim, remaking his own 1956 film of the same name, had hoped this might do for De Morney what the original film did for famous sex symbol Brigitte Bardot, but the film turned out to be a box-office dud, and she'd have to wait a few more years before her chilling performance in 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle' finally saw her deservedly hit the big time.",
         "Roger Vadim's remake of his own film opens with a ridiculous jail break from what appears to be a soccer mum in a mullet and tracksuit and leads to a number of other embarrassing sequences that are at least saved with an early nude scene from Rebecca DeMornay. The moment is quickly ruined by a music sequence or however else Vadim over idealises his leading lady. It turns out this scene indicates DeMornay's desire to escape from prison and pursue her realistic dream of being a famous rock and roll star. The whole experience starts getting humorous when DeMornay is sent back to prison and arranges to marry a young carpenter to beat parole on the advice of Frank Langella, a candidate running for governor of New Mexico that ran into DeMornay during her failed escape from prison. Despite the obvious predictability of the love triangle that film will pursue the film is redeemed from plenty of comedic moments thanks to the strong performances from DeMornay and a whole cast of unknown actors. It turns out irresponsible screw ups are a great source of comedy. However, plenty of embarrassing moments continue to show up in the film including a cringe worthy disrobing of some random actress who rocked up to work in granny panties and a nauseating navel gazing Langella. It is pretty depressing seeing how easily the men in this film can be led just because someone is attractive regardless what a terrible human being said person is. I think the film is meant to be a farce, it's all very light hearted with some tacky New Romantic 80s pop thrown in.",
         "Roger Vadim's 1956 film 'And God Created Woman' created the sensation that was Brigitte Bardot with its then shocking portrayal of a woman who would use her sexuality to get what she wanted or on a whim with equal abandon. Thirty years later, a parallel portrait of feminine caprice had little impact on movie-goers jaded by 70s excesses. The film itself is moreover less visually interesting than the earlier one, replacing the splendor of the Cote d'Azure with the drabness of the American southwest. In place of a woman as tropical orchid, we get a cactus flower. The plot moves forward in arbitrary jumps that make little sense. Somebody needs to remind Vadim that capriciousness and randomness are not synonyms. Add in that the male leads seem to be sleepwalking through the movie and there is little here to like. And the urban cool of Rebecca deMornay does nothing to evoke the energetic spunkiness of Bardot in the original. Avoid.",
         "I love this film because both the movie and Rebecca De Mornay are bright, breezy, and fun. It's a Cinderella story turned on it's ear with a blue collar Prince Charming (Billy played by Vincent Spano) barely able to stay afloat in contemporary middle income lifestyle, but stable enough to help lift a lovely jailbird Princess (Robin played by De Mornay) out of both a physical and personal prison, but this being a contemporary story she controls her own destiny and plots her own path. An evil politician (played by Frank Langella) adds to the fun as does some laughs that springs from realistic situations. At the heart is an old-fashioned romance. We know from the start that Billy and Robin are meant for each other. The language and tasteful love scenes that give the film an R-rating are overshadowed by the entire atmosphere of the film which more accurately should have been awarded a PG-13 rating (this is not Hand That Rocks the Cradle or Risky Business). Despite themes of feminism and romance, there is enough fun to keep the guys interested too, most notably the sexy but ever wholesome De Mornay.",
         "I can't believe this movie is so trashed and Ms.DeMornay got a worst actress award and \"Razzie\" award.Number one if you only watch a movie to see nudity,you must be a loser.To me it was a story of an independent woman who had some speed bumps in her life.She understands some men use women and vice versa for their own conveniences.So do the men she deals with only Billy is a decent guy too.The relationship was both business and free spirited romance and if you've never experienced free spirited romance(I'm not God's gift to word composition)you haven't lived.She's both tough and vulnerable,she has to be, because of her background.I like the saying \"If your two hours late,you might as well not go in at all\".Too much is made of this and that in movies,I recommend watching it.I'll be getting the DVD as soon as my own economy improves.",
         "First off.. If I could rate this movie more than 10, I would; to say this movie is \"excellent\", is a total understatement. A lot of user reviews on this movie are saying its basically crap.. Um.. NO!! Im a HUGE Frank Langella Fan.. and I remember my first reaction.. it was the same as my second reaction, watching it last night. (more on it below ;) ) The basic story in the movie is Rebecca DeMornay's character, Robin Shay, marries a man she met while \"breaking in\" to prison.. Just to get out of Prison again.. She starts an unlikely friendship between the Governor to-be, James Teirnan ( played by Langella <3 ) So the marriage is not going too great, and they both cheat... Rebecca's character with Frank Langella's character. She starts up a band, with her brother in-law and other guys, and after being caught having sex with her husband,, on camera.. she needed to get on Tiernan's good side, so she played at his fundraiser and basically made him win. Let me tell you why this movie was so amazing and will forever be in my top 5 movies, EVER! 2 words. FRANK LANGELLA! I knew this movie was gonna be good, even when I saw the trailer.. Im not joking.. this is ONE of the sexiest roles he has EVER played.. All throughout the movie, the viewers can see that Tiernan wants Shay, by a simple hug, phone call.. Then my favourite scene EVER in the movie was the seduction scene. It starts out with them playing pool, and drinking.. as the game progresses, he leans in to kiss her, she pulls back.. When she tells him \" One more game- the winner says due, the loser, dies\" she lays on the table.. he makes his way to her , spreads her legs, picks her up, as they are inches away from kissing.. he says \"your on\". I could've died, right there. After the pool game is over, he loses, so he asks her \"what you want?!\", she then replies \" get down on your knees\" !! she spreads her legs, he takes off her belt ever so intensely.. kissing her stomach, licking her belly button.. and just starts... OH MY GOD!! The next scene with them shows Tiernan, in a hot tub.. they are kissing and I know what she was doing with her hand lol It then, shows him on top of her, kissing her body.. After they had finished, he politely asks her to stay the night and she rejects him :(.. ( if I were her, I wouldn't have rejected him :( ), not even now. YUM lol Every smirk, smile, pleasurable face he made was amazing.. My reaction to those scenes is the same every time, sometimes i think i need an oxygen tank, not because of the \"go to\" obvious answer, but because i was surprised and happy also hes soo manly. I'd actually need to stop the movie just to calm down lol case and point, this movie deserves more than a 10/10 rating."
