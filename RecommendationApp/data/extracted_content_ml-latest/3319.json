         "Remember when art films weren't directed by teenagers for teenagers? Remember when they didn't have anything to do with pop culture. Remember when there was actually something as an adult culture? Neither do I. But there must be some old people out there who do. \"Independent films\", a new genre that has replaced what used to be called \"art films\", are not worthy of their name. They're, on the whole, hip, mass-marketed screwball comedies, \"chick flicks\", novelty films, etc. Little other than budget separates an \"independent film\" from a slick, cynical Hollywood marketing effort. In fact, many independent films are slick, cynical Hollywood marketing efforts. Seeing Judy Berlin is what it used to be like seeing art films. The very fact that nothing in it is designed to shock or surprise you will shock and surprise you. The very fact that nothing in it was test-screened for maximal emotional manipulation will maximally emotionally manipulate you. The fact that no surprising plot twists were inserted to make you want to go see it again will so surprise you that you will want to see it again. This is not necessarily an endorsement. But I want to stress that this is a film that will not remind you of any other film. It will not be die hard on an anything. It doesn't count Gilligan's Island and My Favorite Martian among its influences, but Checkhov, Camus and Bergman--the sorts of things you've been taught to think are pretentious and stodgy. It is something new--even dare I say it, experimental. Gasp! Avant garde. It wasn't made to make the most money possible. There will be no toy tie-in available with your happy meal. Whatever you think of this film, cherish it as a kind of throwback, a one-in-a-million, the last dodo bird yet living.",
         "This is the neglected gem of last year, and in my estimation the best film of the year. Think of it as a middle-class Ice Storm, but while the upper-class suburbanites of Ice Storm were too distant and unreal to care about, the middle-class lives depicted in Judy Berlin are very real and both heart-breakingly sad and genuinely funny (without caricature or directorial mocking). I've often heard the phrase laughing through tears, but never experienced it until seeing this film. The performances are without exception incisive and dead-on. Of particular note: the counterpoint of Aaron Harnick's sad, lost David and the open-faced lifeforce that is Edie Falco's Judy; Barbara Barrie's portrait of a loving schoolteacher -- with an edge; Bob Dishy's sullen and conflicted Arthur, among the most subtle work in this usually comic actor's long career; and Madelyn Kahn in her final film role, touching and hilarious (as always) as a housewife on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Her scene when she encounters her psychiatrist while aimlessly wandering the streets during the eclipse, and manages to offer him words of comfort, is the film's defining moment -- a film of beautifully etched characters behaving in very real yet very surprising ways in moments of conflict filled with shades of gray. Speaking of which, the film is shot brilliantly in black and white to point up both the beauty and the horror of this suburban landscape. However did this film languish on a shelf for two years? If film scripts were eligible for Pulitzer Prizes, Eric Mendelsohn's would have surely been a contender.",
         "In a day of eclipse in Babylon Village, in New York, the thirty-two year-old aspirant actress Judy Berlin (Edie Falco) is moving to California expecting to make her dream come true. Her mother Suzan 'Sue' Berlin (Barbara Barrie) is a bitter school teacher that likes to flirt with the principal Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy), who is married with the housewife Alice Gold (Madeline Kahn) that is close to a breakdown. Their thirty year-old son David Gold (Aaron Harnick) has just moved back home after a frustrating experience as filmmaker. While wandering on the street, David meets Judy who studied with him in the elementary school and they spend the day together. Meanwhile the confused Arthur kisses Sue during the eclipse. \"Judy Berlin\" is a delightful low-budget movie with entwined stories in the suburb of Babylon. The performances are excellent, disclosing the intimacy of the characters in a realistic way. This movie was released in Brazil on VHS by Cult Films Distributor. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"Judy Berlin\"",
         "After reading all the reviews of people complaining about either how pretentious or boring \"Judy Berlin\" was, I just had to write something about how incredible this movie is. It is the complete opposite of pretension. Real people, living real lives, catching us up in their emotion as we recognize and identify with their loneliness. I just don't get how this is pretentious. Perhaps it could be because \"pretentious\" is a word most people throw around to sound smart without knowing what it means. \"Pi\" is pretentious, \"Judy Berlin\" is not. Filled to the brim with haunting and incredible performances, it evokes Allen's more insightful dramas, such as \"Interiors,\" as well as Ingmar Bergman's best work. And yet, Bergman is not in style now. Mass culture goes more for the insane mind-benders, like \"Fight Club\" and \"Being John Malkovich.\" Even though both were great movies, \"Judy Berlin\" is better. It is an exploration of the souls of a small town. Madeline Kahn, Edie Falco, Barbara Barrie, and Bob Dishy are all superb, completely immersing themselves in their roles. Not to mention the gorgeous cinematography or the incredible harpsichord soundtrack. \"Judy Berlin\" has a lot to say, if you'll just listen to it.",
         "JUDY BERLIN was obviously inspired by the many comedies of Woody Allen. Everything from the black and white look (that Allen used in MANHATTAN and STARDUST MEMORIES among others), to the neuroses of it's main character David (a struggling filmmaker) to the girl he tries to win (THE SOPRANOS' great Edie Falco) to the portrayal of the parents (including the late, great Madeline Kahn, in her final performance), all suggests Woody. But the director, Eric Mendelson, making his first film, captures all these people in the same way Allen does in all their humour- but also suggests a level of sadness that Woody hardly ever did. This is a wonderful little film that should be enjoyed by all.",
         "JUDY BERLIN (2000) ** Edie Falco, Barbara Barrie, Bob Dishy, Madeleine Kahn, Aaron Harnick, Julie Kavner, Anne Meara. The Sundance Film Festival has recently been the equivalent of the farm system in baseball: the pick of the crop for the big leagues. Once again it has managed to make a small, independent film a chance at the 'show' with the winner of the 1999 Best Director Award with new filmmaker Eric Mendelsohn's unique comedy/drama. Edie Falco (the Emmy winning delight of HBO's juggernaut series 'The Sopranos') stars as the eponymous character as a slightly goofy woman whose desire to move to California to pursue her dream of being a real actress is set in the day in the life of her last day in the dream like visage of Babylon, Long Island, where her current gig is as a historical recreationist (i.e. like going to Colonial Williamsburg to see how the settlers lived). Also included in the series of vignettes are her mother Sue (the wonderful character actress Barrie, late of tv's 'Suddenly Susan') as an elementary school student who inspires her students to prepare for the day's solar eclipse; Dishy as the school's sad-faced principal; Meara and Kavner (also vets of the comedy pantheon better known for the better half of Ben & Jerry and Marge Simpson, respectively) as the school's secretary and kitchen worker. The only connecting theme overall is how mundane life can be when one's full potential is either aborted, forecluded or non-existent and equal parts could be argued for Dishy and Kahn's mopey 30 yr.old filmmaker son (Harnick, the real-life son of Barrie) who happens upon Falco and tags along for her last day home, discovering some little known secretive points of interest. Mendelsohn's shoe-string budgeted production only enhances the simplistic yet well acted piece and provides a dreamy ethereal plane of existence with his economically yet artistically smart use of gorgeous black and white cinematography (kudos to Jeffrey Seckendorf) suggests an endless timepiece. What he lacks in big scale opportunity is compensated for a fine comic timed performance piece. Sadly this was Kahn's swan song and she gives a nicely layered performance of daffiness mixed with an innate sadness \u0096 the best of all clowns by the way in their art \u0096 as the housewife to Dishy, who realizes that things aren't so great after all. Her sing-song deliveries are priceless in her dewy-eyed optimism. What is lacking however is any real one character to root for or hold a more potent interest \u0096 more than the sum of its parts \u0096 when instead a sprinkling of eccentricities and divine human emotion predominate the film as a whole; not a bad thing at all.",
         "In a film full of wonderful, low-key performances by actors playing lonely, unhappy characters, Madeline Kahn is the standout as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Unlike any other performance she gave in film, Kahn -- known for her comic roles -- turns in a marvelous, dramatic turn that should have netted her a posthomous Academy Award nomination. She is simply brilliant, and she should have been given a lot more dramatic roles in her career. After all, they say that comedy is the hardest thing for an actor to do, and with all the great comic roles she had -- in \"Paper Moon,\" \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein,\" just to name a few -- directors should have known that behind those funny faces was a great actress who could play any role.",
         "News of an impending solar eclipse has an irrational affect on the residents of a stifling New York suburb, particularly between parents and their now-grown children. Writer-director Eric Mendelsohn has an undeniable talent for ferreting out quirky human behavior from chance meetings and ordinary interaction. He has assembled a solid cast of actors, though he seems to have allowed his players to self-define their characters and, as a possible result, the picture doesn't have much meat on its bones. Mendelsohn is amusingly cognizant of how people react in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations, yet he sets up ideas for potential scenes that never quite come through (such as having the schoolchildren being told how to view an eclipse--though when the big moment arrives, their reaction is to jump up and down as if a parade were passing by). \"Judy Berlin\" has some courage, but it's crass; an arty series of vignettes which feels long at 97 minutes. Moments of vitality do stand out, and the black-and-white cinematography by Jeffrey Seckendorf is expressive, if derivative. Michael Nicholas' mandolin-heavy score works to create a quirky mood, and yet intimate conversation and revelations do not a movie make. *1/2 from ****",
         "This film has a quiet beauty and some very wonderful performances. However, the poetry of the movie is too disjointed for my personal taste. I understand the ideas the director is going for, but I felt the movie lacked enough charm to pull it off. The dialogue has moments of reality, yet often tries too hard for truth, missing the mark. This is a very artistic effort, not meant for the average movie-goer. With a bit more practice and polish, the director could one day be quite great. He needs to stop imitating others and find his own voice. I was torn between admiring it's gentility and screaming to have the monotony end! That is real life, isn't it? Sometimes moments last too long and others pass too quickly. It is a film for film lovers, yet needs a tighter reining by the editor/director.",
         "Judy Berlin is a unique independent film and stands out also because it was the final film of the late and great Madeline Kahn. Filmed in black and white and directed by Eric Mendelson, I was actually an extra in the diner scene with Edie Falco and Aaron Harnick. You don't actually see me, because Iam far off from the scene. I met Edie and she was very nice. A good friend of mine is her first cousin. I was hoping to finally meet Madeline Kahn, but she wasn't in the scene they were filming that day. Even Edie was disappointed she didn't have any scenes with her in the whole movie. The rest of the cast is so great. Bob Dishy, Barbara Barrie, Julie Kavner, Anne Meara and the rest all are a pleasure to watch. It was filmed here in New York, all over Long Island. The film is funny and so bittersweet. It played all the film festivals in 1999 and was officially released in 2000. Madeline Kahn passed away in December of 1999, so it was released 2 months after. Even though she didn't live to see the year 2000 she has this one remarkable film for her only movie of the 21st century. If she had lived, she may have won an academy award for her outstanding performance. Watch it and you see if she wasn't Oscar worthy. The DVD has some great deleted scenes too. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should really give it a try. Its not a big budget comedy or drama, just a small independent film with a big name cast of pros. I have to say though this is the perfect film for us to remember the wonderful and beautiful and the very multi-talented star Madeline Kahn."
