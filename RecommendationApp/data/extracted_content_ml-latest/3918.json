      "synopsis": "The movie opens with Captain Elliott Spencer (Doug Bradley) playing with the Lament Configuration box, only to have it send him to Hell and transform him to the Cenobite \"Pinhead\". Flash forward to the present, where Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) is placed inside the Channard Institute, a psychiatric hospital, and is questioned by Homicide Detective Bronson (Angus MacInnes). After the police search the house where her father, Larry, her stepmother Julia and her uncle, Frank, all died, they stumble upon the bloody mattress Julia had died upon (from the first film) and bag it as evidence. Kirsty meets Dr. Phillip Channard (Kenneth Cranham) and his assistant Kyle MacRae (William Hope) and she tells her story. Before leaving, Kirsty begs Bronson to burn the mattress as it is the only means of bringing Julia back from Hell. Channard goes and talks to Bronson. During her first night, she has trouble falling asleep when she comes across a young girl named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), who has a knack for solving puzzles and has been institutionalized for six months. Kirsty has trouble falling asleep as she begins to hear voices and receives a bloody message written on the wall from a skinless human whom she believes is her father: \"I AM IN HELL. HELP ME.\" Kirsty explains the entire story to Channard after she expresses to Kyle that her father may still be alive. The film then cuts to Channard at his home, revealing that he has stolen the mattress. Kyle sneaks to his house to find that Channard is obsessed with the Lament Configuration box and the portal to Hell. Kyle watches from behind a curtain as Channard brings back a masochistic patient from the ward, handing him a straight razor. The patient slashes himself several times, bleeding onto the mattress. After a few moments, a skinless body emerges from the mattress, draining the masochist. The body in the mattress is actually Julia, whom Channard is trying to resurrect with the promise of learning about the afterlife. Channard brings more corpses to his attic where he hides Julia. After a few victims, she has much of her skin back. Kyle goes back and informs Kirsty about what he saw and that he now believes her. They go to the house together, as Kirsty finds a picture of Spencer before he'd become Pinhead. Kyle runs into Julia: at first he has no idea who she is. Julia locks herself with Kyle in Channard's attic, where the corpses of Julia's victims hang rotting. Julia approaches him and envelopes him with her arms. At first, the weak-willed Kyle has no idea who she is, but then he realizes she is the skinless, monstrous thing that destroyed the mental patient on the mattress. Kyle panics and tries to escape, but Julia's grip prevents him from doing so. Julia makes as if she's kissing Kyle, and works him through a process of sucking him dry. Kyle struggles poignantly to get rid of her grip, but is worked out calmly and effectively by Julia. He screams and moans in pain, and does try to escape from her arms, but Julia is stronger now. As this process of nourishment goes on, Julia gets to recover the whole skin of her back. As she finishes, Kyle has passed out from the struggle and the suffering at the arms of Julia. She relaxes her grip over him, and a bleeding, sucked dry Kyle slowly falls to the ground as a defeated, humiliated husk. Julia and Kirsty finally meet again, and Julia smacks Kirsty as Channard brings another patient: Tiffany. The next scene shows Tiffany is not actually another victim, but is merely being used to open the puzzle box so Channard can experience Hell. The tunnels of Hell are opened and the Cenobites are released, but Pinhead stops the others from killing Tiffany, for he notes that it is not her desire that made her open the box but Channard's. Channard and Julia have both entered the tunnels themselves and begin to explore. Kirsty wakes up and, after seeing what has happened, heads for Hell with the box. When she arrives there, Pinhead finds her and changes the configuration of the box into a shape that appears unsolvable. Kirsty takes the puzzle with her, seeking Tiffany to solve it. Julia introduces Channard to the god of the box's realm, which is a series of pathways that form a strange maze. Leviathan, the god of the realm, represented by a much larger version of the puzzle box in the configuration Pinhead changed it to for Kirsty, revolves at the center of the maze. Channard sees the horror of Leviathan's Hell and realizes it's beyond his comprehension. When he tries to leave, Julia forces him into a much larger version of the box, where he endures unimaginable pain when his face is strung with wires. He emerges from the box some time later, now a Cenobite. A large tentacle painfully grips the top of his head and becomes his new form of mobility. Kirsty eventually finds Tiffany, and they both try to find an exit. Kirsty sees her father's house, and runs in thinking her father might be inside, but it turns out to be Frank. He is the one who sent Kirsty the message, wanting Kirsty to join him. Frank presides over his own chamber of Hell where sheeted women taunt him, never allowing him any pleasure from them. He tries to attack Kirsty and she responds by burning down the house, as well as Frank's flesh. Julia enters with Tiffany, and Frank motions her to kiss him. Julia betrays him, ripping his heart out as the girls make their escape. The girls try and get sucked through, but Julia catches them and grabs onto Tiffany before she is pulled out of her skin. Kirsty and Tiffany make their escape back to the hospital, but the Channard Cenobite finds them and gives chase again. Kirsty encounters Pinhead, Butterball, Chatter, and the Female Cenobite. Kirsty gives Pinhead the picture of Elliot Spencer and reminds them that they were all human at one time, until pain got the better of them. The Channard arrives to capture Tiffany, while the remaining Cenobites all choose to protect Kirsty. Channard kills all the Cenobites (reverting them back to human form) and turns Pinhead's face into Elliot. Elliot smiles at Kirsty and allows her to escape before succumbing to his death; Channard uses strange tentacles with sharp blades to slit Elliot's throat. Tiffany decides to go back into Hell and finish what was started. Kirsty follows as well, but understands that it's all a puzzle. Tiffany attempts to solve the puzzle, but Channard interferes and attacks both girls. Kirsty retreats. As Channard stalks Tiffany, Julia reappears and distracts him with a kiss, long enough for Tiffany to solve the puzzle. As he tries to kill Tiffany, the Channard's tentacles become embedded in the floor and his mobility tentacle rips the top of his head off at the jaw. Tiffany falls over the edge, but Julia catches her and pulls her up (but not before it is revealed that Kirsty has disguised herself in Julia's skin). Both of them escape back to the hospital as the portal closes and they both leave the hospital. Some time later, two movers attempt to pack up all of Channard's belongings before one notices the bloodied mattress. It kills him as the second mover enters the room. A pillar rises up and spins around, showing the near-dead Cenobite Pinhead screaming (Geoffrey Portass) as well as \"Skinless\" Julia, before stopping. The last head (Little John) is revealed to be the same man from the first film, who ends the movie by asking: \"What is your pleasure, sir?\" (the similar line the first film ends with).",

         "Clive Barker is still the king. He brings us to a world where monsters have politics, the 5 senses rule, and we sometimes question whether our pre-notions of pain are as accurate as we think. The Hellraiser series is a lush, nightmarish, subliminal journey into human desire, masochism, mythos and madness. Pinhead is not so much the generic, evil antagtonist as he is a source of comfort and logic sometimes. Clive Barker has often toyed with our preconceptions that all \"monsters\" must be blindly destructive brutes, as opposed to the endearingly rational and decidedly intelligent Cenobites. Perhaps the fact that I have Cenobites tattooed makes me biased;) But it's still a unique piece with gorgeous imagery (to some.) Angels to some, demons to others... If you haven't seen Hellraiser 1 and 2 (the rest are not so great IMHO)...you must!",
         "After the strange events of the first movie,Kirsty is sent to a Institution for the Mentally Sick, commanded by the mysterious Dr. Channard,a crazed psychologist who is willing to open the doors of hell by manipulating the Puzzle Box.In doing so,Channard brings Kirsty's perverse stepmother Julia back to life,and consequently he provokes the rage of the dreadful cenobites,the cruel and evil creatures that give pleasure and pain in the same measure.Hellbound Hellraiser 2 is an extremely well-done film,thanks to the generous budget given to newcomer filmmaker Tony Randel and a first-rate production.The special effects are simply terrific (specially considering the time in which the movie was done,1988) and they create a bombastic,scary visual.I never saw a movie with such an incredible scenery and imagery,except maybe for Dark City.Clive Barker's vision of hell is brought to life with mastery through the work of Randel and Director of Photography Robin Vidgeon. The plot sustains the tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish,though the first half hour of Hellbound: Hellraiser II is a little bit slow and descriptive (but never boring); a great portion of the action and the terror is concentrated in the last minutes. The last thirty ones are a realistic and gutsy \"tour de force\" through fear,violence and suffering.This is definitively a masterpiece, but not for the squeamish.Hellbound: Hellraiser II is rated R for extreme violence and sex scenes,it runs 99 minutes(uncut version released by Anchor Bay).It stars Clare Higgins as Julia, Ashley Laurence as Kirsty, Imogen Boorman as Tiffany,William Hope as Kyle McRae and Kenneth Cranham as Dr. Channard.If you like this movie, you might also enjoy Phenomena and Suspiria.",
         "Thus far and no further is how I view this film - while 'Hellraiser' was a smooth and well-handled interpretation of 'The Hellbound Heart', this serves as an interesting extension to that story. OK, the acting is largly dire - but is this not a horror movie tradition? The film excels in its MENTAL imagery, not physical: Tiffany's disturbing visions of babies with their mouth's sewn shut as Leviathan plays with her fears; Channards violent, acid flashback-style memories... they are all insightful and well-thought out as they deal with that which cannot be tamed easily - the human psyche. Director Tony Randall has a lot to live up to following Clive Barker's '87 epic, but he takes the reigns of the story with good grace and presents a slick and progressive tale - although I do agree with the general consensus that the Cenobites should NOT have been humanised. All in all though a great film, fantastic visuals - the fall of Leviathan at the climax has to be one of the most gripping and explosive deaths of a movie monster in horror film history - and one which should have ended the tale.",
         "\"Hellbound: Hellraiser II\" is just as good as the first one. **SPOILERS** After having survived the Cenobites from the first film, Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) finds herself in a psychiatric hospital, as no one believes her story. Dr. Channard, (Kenneth Cranham) the head of the institute, arrives to treat her, but like the others, doesn't believe her story. As certain elements become more believable, he decides to investigate more fully, eventually finding the mystical Lamont Configuration. In so doing, Julia Cotton, (Claire Higgins) is brought back into the world. When Kirsty discovers this, she finds the Cenobites, lead by Pinhead, (Doug Bradley) are behind the whole affair. Dr. Channard and Julia are also along, trapped in Hell with Pinhead and the others in an intense fight for survival. The Good News: With this one, it ups the ante on violence over th first one so much more. Granted the first one was, this one ups it with ever more. We bypass the traditional hook pulling apart a body, but we do get a particular scene where Pinhead is shown how he gets his name-sake. It's pretty gruesome, and it fits in the rest of the film. The film features an on-screen transformation for a Cenobite, the appearance of skinless people, several mutilated dead bodies scattered throughout the film, and several particularly graphic kills that splatter all over the place. There is tons more blood scattered throughout, including a retread of the skinless person idea from part one. Also, the increased time overall with the Cenobites was greatly appreciated. With them being almost relegated to cameos in that one, here they become so relevant to the plot that it's a great joy to watch them all get plenty of screen time. The convoluted storyline, however, does have a ton of brilliant ideas. The descent into Hell is handled well, the Cenobites are integrated into the story pretty believably, and the whole scheme of events plays out excitingly to watch. It never becomes boring, and the visuals are a big reason for that. It's a great-looking film, with all the special effects and scenery which makes it a great film to get lost in. The Bad News: The film does have some moments where the plot doesn't know where its going. It jumps around between several different themes and motives quite often different one moment to the next. It's kinda confusing, so it's required to spend a couple times with it to figure it out. The Final Verdict: Every bit as good as the original, and then a little more in certain areas. Absolutely, fans of the original will love this one, and while it might not be the most comprehensive movie ever made, horror fans should really take a look at this one. It's got something for everyone. Rated UR/R: Extreme Graphic Violence, some Language, Brief Nudity, and a shadowy, blurry sex scene",
         "Released just over a year after the original, HELLRAISER II picks up right where the last one ended. But with Clive Barker releasing a majority of creative control (he still receives a \"story by\" credit) to screenwriter friend Pete Atkins and first time director Tony Randel, the end result is a film that faithfully echoes Barker's earlier work yet also undermines it. The film's biggest problem is the script which relies too much on coincidence. For example, new character Dr. Channard has a deep and previously existing interest in the Lament Configuration. And Kirsty's neighbor in the mental ward just happens to be a mute girl who is really good at solving puzzles. Things like this exist solely to move the plot from point A to B and so on, something the original HELLRAISER lacked in its confined dysfunctional family storyline. To Atkin's credit, the script does effectively introduce the back story of Pinhead and features some appropriately bleak dialogue (including perhaps the series best line: \"Your suffering will be legendary, even in hell.\"). In their attempt to deliver something bigger and better than the original, the filmmakers further damage themselves when it comes to Kirsty's adversaries. The sequel has two great foes for Kirsty to battle \u0096 Julia and Pinhead \u0096 but the script makes them secondary and shifts the focus to the ridiculous Dr. Channard. While in human form he is a fearsome villain but once he becomes a Cenobite, all that goes out the window in favor of a guy who delivers one liners (\"The Doctor\u0085is\u0085in!\"). At this point in the series, even Pinhead hadn't sunk that low. On top of all that, Atkins actually has the Cenobite Channard dispatch the lead Cenobites in a battle that is so trivializing that it makes you wonder why anyone feared these guys in the first place. Tony Randel handles the film well visually with his two best sequences taking place in hell. One is when mute Tiffany experiences her own surreal vision of hell that includes everything from deranged clowns to a clever giallo tribute. The other is when Kirsty confronts her Uncle Frank in a fiery tomb housing floating slabs that carry moaning, bloody bodies. These visions of hell are certainly unique to the film world but ultimately the film doesn't have the budget to properly convey this. Instead of a sweeping landscape, we get characters traveling what seems to be the same tunnel over and over and a few MC Escher style matte paintings. Most disappointing is the unveiling of Leviathan as an amorphous black blur emitting from a large version of the box. Outside of those uneven effects, the rest of the film's effects work is really well done. Bob Keen and his crew return from the original film and deliver an abundant amount of blood, making sure that the standard of delivering cinematic images beyond belief continues. The bloody resurrection of Julia and the transformation of Dr. Channard are the film's FX highlights. Obviously the unrated version is the way to go. In addition to these striking images, HELLBOUND contains the world's first male/skinless female kiss. And for a film with such taboo images, it features some consistently great acting. Lead Ashley Laurence (was she really in her teens when this was filmed) is actually better than she was in the first film. New faces Kenneth Cranham and William Hope are both good as the bad doctor and good doctor respectively. Doug Bradley, graduating from \"Lead Cenobite\" to a full fledged Pinhead, maintains his wicked demeanor as a hell's no. 1 agent while projecting the right amount of emotion when reminded of his human form. However, if HELLRAISER II truly belongs to anyone, it is Claire Higgins as the evil stepmother Julia Cotton. With a cold manner dipped in extra bitchy-ness, Higgins is almost too good for the proceedings. New World's efforts for the low budget follow up paid off with the film earning just under ($12 million) what the original grossed ($14.5 million). Sadly, the next time Pinhead and his brethren appeared on screen, they were firmly in the claws of Miramx's Dimension line. This move resulted in a succession of sequels that, while passable, moved the series further away from Clive Barker's groundbreaking original.",
         "Hellraiser 2 is a startling film. Clive Barkers imagery of hell is profane, violent, and an oddly erotic movie from the off. The sequel continues the fantastic story, and builds on the characters we saw, whilst adding some new ones to the mix. As well as re-introducing the dead ones! As foul and degrading as newer gore porn flicks are today, Hellbound walks all over them with style and substance which has been unmatched ever since. For 1988, Hellraiser 2 is nothing short of breathtaking, and has not dated one bit. The storyline is intelligent and despite the incredible sights of hell and its inhabitants, Hellbound justifies the fantasy with thoughtful dialogue and logic and a powerful story. It also benefits that the cast in this film are mostly great actors who do a great job of suspending the viewers disbelief. Barker gives credibility to the monster in the movie. Every beast in this film has a human side and you may even feel warmed to them when they are faced with dilemmas and dramas which question even their beliefs. There is a powerful scene in which Pinhead and his minions learn of their own past from Kirsty, the heroin of the story who is pursued by the cenobites for opening the puzzle box. Pinhead even begins to look human at this point showing the \"bad guys\" in a different light. Before long the demons actually become the \"good guys\", and temporarily co-exist with Kirsty to counter the evil Doctor's hand over hell. The violence and gore offered by Hellbound is excessive and delivered to the viewer in such horrific, profane ways it has definitely had an impact on its viewing demographic. Barker made a great job of communicating to the director his view of the film from a novel and it's a gruesome one. So gruesome it will immediately turn away many within the opening minutes. I recommend this movie for anyone who's into horror or those who think the genre is just Hostel and Saw. Hellbound, as indeed the original, breathes new life into the horror movie and for every pint of spilled blood, brings intelligence and style in buckets. 9/10",
         "Even if the story's weak, bringing back the surviving (or not surviving) cast members of the original, can make a sequel better. Everyone thinks crazy old Kirsty Cotton is making up stories of demons from hell (which happened to be her attic), but we all know better, don't we? She's now in a mental institution with a girl with a penchant for solving puzzles, under the guidance of a sadistic doctor with a penchant for a skinless Julia. Part of the story is just a re-hash of the first with different characters in similar situations. This time around we go to hell and find that it's like an Escher painting with a giant \"Lament\" diamond spinning in the sky. Not as good as the first film, but pretty close--a bit gorier and disturbing (but after \"Hellraiser\", I was expecting this) The acting is similar to the first film, but the special effects are a bit more elaborate this time around as the budget was bigger due to the success of it's predecessor.",
         "The first and only decent sequel to Clive Barkers impressive original Hellraiser. Hellbound:Hellraiser 2 starts almost immediately after the event of the original. After a brief recap of Hellraiser up to this point featuring footage form the original, we see another unsuspecting victim, Captain Elliot Spencer (Doug Bradley without his Pinhead special make up effects applied) solve the mystery of the Chinese puzzle box and is impaled with hooks that tear his skin, razors cut lines in his head and an unseen thing inserts long pins into his scalp and thus creating Pinhead (Doug Bradley with the make up), the lead Cenobite from the Hellraiser films. Kirsty (Ashley Laurence again) is seen in a hospital room, the police have discovered rotting maggot infested corpses in Kirstys dads house, like the original in its uncut version this film is very gory and explicit. A detective named Ronson (Angus MacInnes) questions Kirsty, she doesn't make much sense to him, speaking of demons and that her dad is trapped in hell and still suffering. The detective doesn't believe it and hands her over to Dr Channard (Kenneth Cranham). Channard uses the information he gets from Kirsty to re-animate Julia (the returning Clare Higgins). He also uses a patient under his care named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) to solve the puzzle of the box and reopen the door to hell, Pinhead and his Cenobite friends from the original, the Butterball Cenobite (Simon Bamford), the Chatterer Cenobite (Nicholas Vince) and the female Cenobite (Barbie Wilde, who I've met in real life by the way!) also make an appearance and join the fun. Kirsty discovers what Channard is doing and follows him into hell to try and save her dad. Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman another returning cast member from the original) also turns up and soon after loses his heart and skin at the hands of a vengeful Julia. Channard gets turned into a Cenobite and all hell starts to break lose. This time directed by Tony Randel, Hellbound is another impressive film, it recaptures the dark feel and hellish atmosphere of the original. Once again the special make up effects are explicit and well done, people slicing themselves up with straight razors in a very nasty scene, more skinless people and corpses, slit throats, hand amputations, brain surgery and all sorts of other bodily mutilation are presented for our viewing pleasure in the uncut version, which is the one I'm reviewing here. The script co-written by Barker keeps thing moving nicely, even though someone should tell them police officers don't carry guns in the UK, towards the start of the movie a police man while searching the house from the original gets scared by a corpse that falls out of a wardrobe and proceeds to shoot it several times, as I said the police in the UK don't carry guns, I know I've lived here all my life! A very minor complaint. This time the film is mostly set in Hell and we get lots of perverse imagery to convince us. I especially like the juggler who's using his own eyeballs to juggle with. After this the Hellraiser franchise went down hill, becoming too Americanized, part 3 for instance was set in an American city and featured Pinhead and his Cenobites killing lots of teenagers, just like countless other soulless unoriginal slasher films. Hellbound:Hellraiser 2 in my opinion is the only worthy sequel to the original, its dark and has the same perverse atmosphere, it features even more blood gore and mutilation and doesn't feature stupid teenagers been hacked up. A very entertaining horror film for those with the stomach. I liked this just as much as the original, high praise. The version I watched was the recent British special edition DVD from Anchor Bay UK, which is the uncut version, the only way to watch it as far as I'm concerned. Recommended.",

         "\"Hellbound: Hellraiser II\" of 1988 is an almost perfect sequel to one of the most effective and terrifying achievements ever in Horror cinema, Clive Barker's 1987 masterpiece \"Hellraiser\". Director Tony Randel's sequel keeps up the terrifying atmosphere and genuinely infernal creepiness of its predecessor and is even considerably gorier than the (also very gruesome) original. This second entry to the \"Hellraiser\" franchise epitomizes pure Horror as its predecessor and takes the viewer on a terrifying journey into the pits of a Hell from the mind of Clive Barker. The film starts off pretty much where the first part ended. After the horrifying events that took place in part one, survivor Kristy Cotton (Ashley Laurence) awakes in a mental hospital. One might think that psychiatrists are not eager to believe stories about Cenobites, demons from a bizarre, sadomasochistic Hell. The head of the institution, Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham), however, is obsessed with occultism and has his own plans with his new cognitions about cenobites and resurrection from Hell... ***Warning! BIG SPOILERS Ahead!*** Kristy's evil stepmother Julia (Clare Higgins) returns from Hell, and she is not the only one. So do the Cenobites. The cenobites, especially the iconic Lead Cenobite (commonly referred to as 'Pinhead', played by Doug Bradley) are some of the most terrifying creatures the World of Horror has ever brought forth. My only slight complaint about \"Hellbound\" is the manner of how the cenobites are humanized towards the end. It seems to be a common assumption among makers of Horror-sequels, that they somehow need to explain how monsters became monsters - which is not always a good idea, in my opinion. Ever since I first saw the first two Hellraiser parts many years ago, I have held the view that the Cenobites were most terrifying in the first part, when they were still utterly mysterious and their origin was not yet explained. This minor fault is not yet extreme in this second part, however, and it does not waste its status as a fascinating sequel. The visions of Hell are extremely creepy and terrifying and character actor Kenneth Channard brings in a new type of purely evil villain. The sequel is, once again, filmed excellently, the settings are sublime and the gore-effects are as gruesome as it gets. Overall, \"Hellbound\" is an extraordinary sequel that must not be missed by Horror fans. After this, the series spiraled downwards. My rating: 8.5/10"
