         "content": "I don't need cards to figure out who I am, I already know.\r\n\r\nLonely Are The Brave is directed by David Miller and adapted for the screen by Dalton Trumbo from the novel \"The Brave Cowboy\" written by Edward Abbey. It stars Kirk Douglas, Gena Rowlands, Walter Matthau & George Kennedy. Cinematography is from Phillip H. Lathrop and Jerry Goldsmith scores the music in what was his first major studio work.\r\n\r\nJohn (Jack) W. Burns is an old school cowboy who refuses to adapt to the new world he finds himself in. Modern technology is alien to him and he would rather perpetually roam with his horse Whiskey than ever contemplate getting in a car or a jet. Upon learning that his dear friend Paul (Michael Kane) is in jail, it's not long before Jack himself finds he's in jail after a barroom fight\u2026..and then promptly sets about breaking Paul and himself out. Only Paul doesn't want to go, he wont jeopardise the family life waiting for him on the outside by becoming a fugitive. Jack escapes and heads for the hills on Whiskey, with the law, and all their modern technology, in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\nOfficially Douglas' favourite film in his long and varied career, Lonely Are The Brave is a wonderfully elegiac picture about a man out of his time. Boosted by impeccable lead performances, a great script and gorgeous black & white photography, it's hard to believe it was met with a lukewarm response upon its release. Set in 1950s New Mexico the film elegantly tells how the frontier is vanishing; to be replaced by progress and technology. Douglas' character, a wandering cowboy, is a symbol of nostalgia, where Trumbo's screenplay offers a cautionary observation about restriction of freedom and individuality. Themes close to home with the writer with the HUAC incidents still fresh in the memory. Lonely Are The Brave could quite easily now be subtitled the Punk Rock Western.\r\n\r\nThere's a number of scenes in the piece that leave indelible marks. A rip snorting fist fight between Jack and a one armed man is high powered and potent, the farewell scene between Jack and Paul's wife Jerry (Rowlands) is sexually charged and wrought with an impending finality. The whole pursuit as Jack and Whiskey scale the rocky hills, pursued by helicopter, car and a vengeful prison guard, is gripping and laced with emotion. While the finale, tho forewarned to us from early in the piece, is one of the most heart tugging moments in Western movie history. Director Miller doesn't have the CV that his work here suggests he should have; given the assured way he crafts this story. For he, along with all the others involved (must mention Goldsmith's evocative score too), has delivered a classy bit of cinema across the board. A pertinent piece about the changing world and the characters left behind in its wake. 9/10",

         "At Last! One of the most eagerly requested movies gets a Region 1 DVD release. For many years now collectors have been hollering for LONELY ARE THE BRAVE (1962) to be issued. So Universal have finally seen the folly of their ways and here it is in a splendid 2.35 sharp as a button Monochrome widescreen presentation that everyone will adore. Although there is in existence a reasonably good Region 2 version from Spain it cannot compare to this new release. Kirk Douglas is terrific in the story we all know and love of the free- spirited latter day cowboy who resents the conventions and restrictions of the modern day west (\"everywhere you go, keep out, stop, no entry, go away, get lost\", drop dead\"). The wire cutters he carries in his saddle-bags gets plenty of use! On the run from the law because of a misdemeanour he takes to the hills with his faithful horse Whiskey in an attempt to escape into Mexico. But the rough terrain and upward climb is not easy particularly for a man on horseback. In a wonderful scene where he realizes he would make it without the animal he leaves Whiskey and begins to climb a cliff. But looking back at her and with that soulful look in her eyes as she watches him climb he just can't do it. He comes back down to the horse mumbling..... \"you're worse than a woman\". It is one of Douglas' best and most likable roles! Being alone for a good portion of the movie he dominates the screen. It is an admirable and engaging performance plus his expert handling of the horse is quite remarkable. Giving excellent support is Walter Matthau as the pursuing but compassionate sheriff Morey Johnson (\"ye son of a gun - ye made it\"!). John Schillart gives an amusing turn as the guileless deputy. \"Judas priest Morey!\" he exclaims as the sheriff bumps his way along the rough trail at speed in the jeep. The female lead is taken by a young and quite beautiful Gena Rowlands as the wife of Douglas' jailed best friend. However the relationship between her and the cowboy is kind of puzzling! The kisses and clinches to my mind appear a tad steamy for a pair who are supposed to be just good friends.Hmmm! Also in one of his early roles is George Kennedy as a sadistic guard and watch out for the late Bill Bixby as the helicopter pilot. The only drawbacks I found in the picture is the over emphasis on the Carroll O'Connor character as the truck driver. After all the horse could have been hit by a motor cycle and end up the same way. Also the great scene where the cowboy makes that dash for the trees under gunfire and in the ensuing shot rides into a indoor exterior. Wow! I thought they had stopped using indoor exteriors by 1962! Also I thought the downbeat ending somewhat severe for what is essentially a light hearted drama and we never do learn what becomes of our cowboy! Sharply photographed in Panavision by Phil Lathrop the film based on the novel \"The Brave Cowboy\" by Edward Abbey had a fine screenplay fashioned by Dalton Trumbo. David Miller - who never really distinguished himself except maybe with \"Sudden Fear\" (1953) - does a nice job in the director's chair and composer Jerry Goldsmith provided a wistful score with one of his early efforts. Surprisingly there is no trailer but the extras do have two interesting featurettes. One called \"Lonely Are The Brave - A Tribute\" has contributions from Steven Spielberg, Michael Douglas, Gena Rowlands and a very aged Kirk Douglas. The other, blandly presented by some record producer, shows Jerry Goldsmith at work scoring the picture. AN EXCELLENT ISSUE OF AN OVERDUE AND MUCH VAUNTED CLASSIC!",
         "This is certainly Kirk Douglas' best movie and that is saying a lot! The loss of individuality and the valuesof the West, if anything, are more pronounced today than when the film was made. Kirk's performance is perfectly understated as fits the character he portrays. No false heroics, gore, or sensationalism which all too often ruin today's movies . One reviewer commented that there was not a satisfactory conclusion... no last words by Douglas, uncertainty about his fate, and the ambivalent response of the sheriff, Walter Matthau. This is no simple movie with clear cut heroes and villains. There are only people who contend with the compromises one accepts or, in the rare instance of Kirk's character, one attempts to overcome. The affinity between Kirk and his horse are central to the theme and end of this fine film. Everyone connected in the making of this classic. I rate it a 10.",
         "No Western could be more out of time-scale than \"Lonely are the Brave,\" and yet, paradoxically, no central character was ever more truly Western than Jack Burns, the strange wanderer, played by Kirk Douglas\u0085 Douglas in this film version of Edward Abbey's moving novel 'Brave Cowboy' is, among a number of other things, a man who hates barbed wire\u0085 He showed, a similar dislike for it in King Vidor's \"Man Without a Star\" (1955), which was a traditional cattle range movie, and in those circumstances that seemed reasonable enough\u0085 But \"Lonely are the Brave\" is a film set in the New Mexico of 1953 and such behavior now seems totally irrational\u0085 But then he's an irrational, quite extraordinary man\u0085 He rides a horse called Whisky when the world flashes past him in Cadillacs\u0085 He carries a guitar and sings folksy ballads of the old West... Arriving in the concrete of Duke City he is quite confident that in order to free a pal he has only got to break into jail, fool a sheriff and make his getaway\u0085 After all, it's Western territory and this was always the way of it\u0085 Who and what is he? The question bears examination for he is one of the most intriguing characters in the whole Western portrait gallery... He is never really explained in the book, nor indeed in the film\u0085 He is drawn and stated and the rest is left to the reader or audience\u0085 You watch the way he moves, you listen to what he says and the way he says it\u0085 You observe his strange actions and reactions\u0085 But most1y you are left to make your own conclusions\u0085 Is it a case of a fantasist totally hooked on the Western legend? Has he seen too many Western movies (probably 'B' features)? Has he read too much Western pulp fiction? Is he so deep in thought by it all that he is incapable of realizing that the world has moved on, is running out of grass, or tolerance for oddballs with a preference for grass? Is he making a protest about what the West has become, and is seeking, in his inarticulate way, after different values? Is he just pure throwback, a man belonging to another time? This figures, as he might say\u0085 He would belong so splendidly, with his simple values\u0085 Whatever he is, he's a profoundly tragic conception.... The old friend he is there to aid (Michael Kane) has been jailed for giving shelter to over-the-border illegal immigrants\u0085 Douglas calls on his buddy's wife, sensitively played by Gena Rowlands, who seems as touched and dazed by him as anyone in the audience\u0085 In order to get Kane out of prison he decides that he first needs to get into it himself and so after a saloon bar fight, followed by more fisticuffs at the jail, he gets the cell he wants\u0085 In jail, however, he finds himself once more knocking up against the twentieth century\u0097its mores and inhibitions\u0085 The pal doesn't want to conform to the old Western pattern by making a break for it\u0085 Far better to serve out his two years and then return to his wife and child knowing that his 'debt to society' has been paid and they will have nothing else to worry about\u0085 This is not just pure self-interest\u0085 He honestly thinks it the right thing to do\u0085 So having fought his way in, Douglas now has to fight his way out\u0085 This he does with the aid of files he brought with him to effect his friend's escape\u0085 And out with him go a couple of characters not inhibited by fears and scruples\u0085 So he becomes a man on the run, but, since he still has his horse, an old-style outlaw on the run, heading for the mountains with\u0097naturally\u0097a posse after him\u0085 But no ordinary posse\u0085 This is the 20th century version, supplied with all sorts of technological devices\u0085 If this very recent cowboy in his strange, ancient times way, is challenging the rule of technology, it is only logical that the long cold arm of science should reach out for him\u0085 It does so with walkie-talkie radios, jeeps and even a specially borrowed helicopter\u0085 What chance has he? The sheriff seems puzzled by the situation\u0097that a man on a horse should dare everything against such a formidable array of gadgetry\u0085 Since the enigmatic wanderer is determinedly playing out a Western drama he must inevitably come up against a compassionate sheriff\u0085 The sheriff is a man doing a job, without any keen enjoyment for the job or, in fact, for anything particularly\u0085 He's bored, skeptical, laconic, and you feel that he would like nothing better than for Burns to get out of his territory\u0085 But while the sheriff goes about his manhunting duties in a routine way he lets slip another implication\u0097that deep, down in the lethargy and disillusion there's a soft spot for the man on a horse\u0085 Is the sheriff at heart\u0097if you could ever find his heart\u0097a bit of a rebel, too? Kirk Douglas will be remembered most of all for his performance as the man out of step, out of his proper time\u0085 His Jack Burns in \"Lonely are the Brave\" is one of the warmest, most deeply felt characterizations in all Western movies\u0085 David Miller directed the film with simplicity and a similar warmth\u0085 No more was needed\u0085",
         "I pity those who cannot, even in a small way, identify with Douglas' character, Jack Burns in this ageless work of art. This is a self described 'lonely man,' of no use to his true love( who has married his old friend) because he cannot share his life with anyone. He acknowledges that he is of no use to anyone. Rather he is a constant threat to whatever social order he encounters. The one time he makes a commitment, to his horse no less, he loses his edge. And probably his freedom. What a wonderful movie this is.It steeps itself in the fading of the West. While much of it is seemingly allegorical, there is also a truthfulness, and a tenderness in Burns search for escape over the mountains. Someone else has commented on the similarities between Burns and Bogart's rendition of Roy Earle in HIGH SIERRA. Surely any thoughtful movie goer has experienced that rush to the mountains, that sense that time has passed you by and you are not of this place.",
         "Lonely Are the Brave (1962) is a film about a man who's content with life on the open range. He's the last of his kind, the wandering cowboy. The problem is the open range is disappearing around him. A guy like that can't live off the land anymore because there's no land for him to live off of. Everywhere he goes the land is either owned or forbidden for him to enter. Kirk Douglas stars as the last cowboy who just can't get it into his head how much the times have changed. Especially when he tries to rescue his good friend from the local jail. This causes more trouble than he can comprehend. What's so funny about this movie is how much of the story, scenes and situations were later used in it's quasi-remake \"First Blood\". The basic story line and his troubles with the law are quite similar. Walter Matthau and Gena Rowlands co-star in this awesome film about a dying way of life. I saw this film several years ago on Turner Classic Movies. It's a sad tribute to the old west. Highly enjoyable and recommended. P.S. Gena Rowlands looks pretty good in this picture!",
         "I just couldn't let the previous review stand as the only review of this film. Based upon The Brave Cowboy, by Edward Abbey, Lonely Are The Brave is a very good screen adaptation of that classic work. Ed Abbey excelled at demonstrating the loss of the West, either in the environmental impacts that devastate vast areas (The Monkey Wrench Gang, Hayduke Lives), or the loss of individuality and freedom (Fire on the Mountain, The Brave Cowboy). Ed Abbey understood that the character of America survived-until recent times-upon rugged individualism that could unite with others in times of trouble. Jack Burns is an individualist who wants to live his own way, yet he had fought in WWII, and was coming to the aid of a friend. Burns does not try to make others live as he does or make them believe as he does, he simply wants to be left alone in a rapidly shrinking world with his sense of frontier dignity intact. Walter Matthau plays the sheriff who understands his adversary too well; his is the character that has lost the faith and become a collaborator. Matthau's bumbling deputies represent the federal government who stumble over themselves in order to crush Burns' freedom. Kirk Douglas considers this one of his most important films. Ed Abbey approved of the film and even makes a walk-on appearance.",
         "This is a wonderful movie that never fails to impress me whenever I view it. I'm amazed that it is not out on DVD yet. As many have stated, Kirk felt that this was his favorite movie and I quite agree. As the existential drifter searching for something that has long passed him by, Kirk delivers a stunning performance. I felt that the character development in this film was outstanding. Each individual plays an important role in delivering the theme of the story. I was amazed that no one wrote about the bar fight scene where Burns battles a bitter one-armed local. There is something disturbing about this encounter...the one-armed man's bitterness and Burns' attempt to avoid the confrontation. Handled in black and white, this scene is memorable. This film easily makes my top ten list. -Paige",
         "Can you imagine a time when a man could mount his horse and ride across the country, camping wherever he pleased? It's the kind of life Kirk Douglas was still living as the cowboy in \"Lonely Are The Brave,\" long after the horse had given way to the horseless carriage and most people were living in towns and cities working for someone else. His only accommodation to the modern world are a pair of snips he keeps in a saddle bag for getting through barbed wire fences. A man like that is just bound to run up against the System, and that is precisely what happens when the cowboy arrives at the house of an old friend, whose wife they both loved. She tells him that her husband has been jailed for smuggling illegals across the border and the cowboy resolves to get arrested and help him break out. However, married life has changed his friend's perspective and he is content to do his time. After taking a beating from the sadistic jailer, played by George Kennedy, the cowboy escapes alone. The rest of the movie is about his attempt to elude the authorities, led by Walter Matthau as the efficient sheriff in charge of lesser lights who admires Douglas enough to hope he makes good his escape and who pursues him skillfully but without enthusiasm. Much of the story is about the relationship between the cowboy and his inexperienced young horse, who symbolizes the wild and free life being lost bit by bit. As they surmount a rugged mountain range, the extent of their trust, affection, and ties to the land become clear, while so-called civilization, aptly represented by a truckload of new toilets, threatens to do what the police can't. This is a very good movie, well-shot, well-acted, well-written, and with a very poignant theme. In it, Kirk Douglas delivers one of his best performances.",
         "I agree with Douglas in considering this his best film, in my opinion together with Man Without a Star. He is a lonely cowboy, living a meaningless life, beginning to realize his mistake about the way he lived. When he goes for his last stand, there is something desperate about it. At a certain moment we see Douglas running away from the police in the mountains, together with his horse Whiskey, when they see a wild cat (jaguar?, puma?). It is a memorable scene, because the three of them look sad, surpassed by the times, represented by the highway that is near. This film probably was made in Albuquerque, NM, I think I can recognize the Sandia Mountains on the background.",
         "I was pleasantly surprised to see so many \"10\" ratings. I thought this was a secret between Kirk Douglas (who used to shop in the wee morning hours at the same supermarket as I did when I lived in Hollywood in the 70s) and I .. I saw a retrospective where he said of all his movies, this was his favorite. On my Top 10 All Time list as well. When the movie came to Texas, where I saw it, I think it barely lasted through the opening weekend before it was pulled. Amazed and pleased that there are so many who have seen it and rated it so highly. Way to go guys."
