The plot of \"A Civil Action\" is based on a true story of the successful personal injury \"ambulance chaser\" [Characters' words] lawyer, otherwise unfulfilled, secretly hoping for that one big case. The case he gets is unexpected and did cost him his livelihood, but apparently (as the entire movies' main action points are transferred between each other by the main characters' own narration) imbued him with a better outlook on what it means to be \"successful\". The characters names are not changed, also because it is a true story. At the very end of the movie (yes, there is a spoiler one could say) that involves a potential appeal in the Supreme Court - again, true as revealed in the pre-credit roll often seen in true-story films, such as \"Erin Brockovich\". The \"big case\" is that recorded 1981 of the People of Mass. vs. W. R. Grace and Beatrice Foods, who had been dumping a cancer-causing industrial solvent into the water table of Woburn, Massachusetts for many years - more than a decade. Beatrice Foods was the parent company of W.R. Grace, a Long Grove, IL. based chemical invention company, known for mixing chemicals experimentally, as was their charge.",

         "I'm usually put off by courtroom films simply because I associate them with either the tendency for pompous and ornate speech-making a la \"A Few Good Men,\" or cheap audience-manipulation a la \"Primal Fear.\" Yes, they are entertaining, usually with great actors and fine performances - thinking man's thrillers. But generally they remain nothing more than that - a well-done conversation piece. \"A Civil Action\" was a pleasant surprise because it is not only like neither of those films, but also because it is a good film starring John Travolta. While he had his moments in the spotlight for good reason (think: \"Pulp Fiction\") his movies are generally not that great. But that's just a personal opinion and I may be wrong. Still, \"A Civil Action\" is a great courtroom film. For one, it's a true story (which doesn't necessarily say much), and it is told with restraint, quietness and respect for the characters involved (which should be saying a lot). It takes the best from \"Silkwood\" and \"Verdict\" and it gives us people who are real and who engage in battle the way we imagine real people would. They don't have dramatic moments in the courtroom upon which an unreal stillness descends so as to be shattered at the end of the speech by the thunderous sound of unanimous, emotionally-fraught clapping. John Travolta is great here and so is the rest of the cast, among them William H. Macy, Kathleen Quinlan, Sydney Pollack, John Lithgow, Stephen Fry (in a small cameo role), Kathy Bates (in an even smaller cameo role) and the great Robert Duvall. In the end, it is Duvall who steals the show in his quiet, unemotional musings, advice-givings and deliberations with Travolta. He embodies the restraint for which the film strives. \"A Civil Action\" is quiet in its proceedings and, consequently real. It tells the story of a lawyer who reluctantly accepts a case having to do with the contamination of water and the deaths of many children in a small town and becomes obsessed with it to the point of going bankrupt. His obsession mirrors the self-destructiveness of Paul Newman's lawyer in \"Verdict,\" and it has real results. His adversaries are not evil people, per se (think Jack Nicholson in \"A Few Good Men\"), but people who are simply doing their jobs damn well, defending their interests. We shouldn't expect them to cave in to pretty speech-making, nor should the jury. And watching \"A Civil Action\" we don't and it doesn't. The personalities clash, personal tragedy is pitted against financial burdens of the legal process, and it yields startling conclusions about the American Justice system. And that is what \"A Civil Action\" chooses to focus on more so than the true story it tells (though it doesn't ignore it either). The film shows the price of justice and how justice is understood in the legal process. In fact, it draws a very fine dichotomy between non-legal justice and legal justice and shows how hard it is to get \"justice\" in a legal setting. Needless to say, it becomes a very expensive ordeal full of re-interpretations of the law and annoying manipulations of it. What we can gather from the story, however, is that we should be grateful for people who are willing to go to extreme lengths, at great personal cost, to define justice on their own terms and to fight for it.",
         "Courtroom drama is a robust dramatic formula; there is human conflict, suspense and, in the verdict, resolution. In the real world court cases don't run to the formula; many cases are stillborn, many are settled before trial, some seemingly decisive victories are reversed on appeal. The lawyers generally seem to survive though. In the American system of civil litigation the contingent fee is common - the lawyer gets paid only if the client succeeds, usually a third of the verdict or settlement amount. This can lead to some pretty crass conduct. In this film, based on a very fine book about real events in the Boston area, we have a rather rare example of a lawyer trying so hard he defeats his own cause. Yet at the end he may have brought about a greater social good. Jan Schlictman (played with smarmy aplomb by John Travolta) is a seasoned plaintiff's lawyer in personal injury cases who knows all the tricks, both in pre-trial negotiation and before a jury. He is persuaded by an associate to look into a claim by a small community that its water has been poisoned by industrial waste resulting in the deaths of at least eight children from leukemia and other ailments. The case captures his attention and before long the entire resources of his four-partner firm are concentrated on it. They are up against a local tannery owner and two huge corporations, Beatrice and W&R Grace. Beatrice is represented by Faucher (a stand-out performance from Robert Duvall) a crusty veteran of 45 years litigation (and Harvard Law School lecturer), and he doesn't have much trouble cutting Jan down to size. Despite the escalating cost Jan doesn't seem to know when to stop. His partner James (another gem-like performance from William H Macy) does everything he can to raise money, including applying for credit cards from banks as far away as Fargo, North Dakota (those who saw Macy in \"Fargo\" will chuckle over that one.) Total disaster is averted but it seems that Jan has been fighting the wrong battle. To fit the mood the lighting is dull (surely the Boston Courts are not quite as gloomy as portrayed) and the weather awful. I've never seen it rain so much in a movie. Against this dismal backdrop the performances are luminous. Apart from those already mentioned there is John Lithgow (of \"Third Rock from the Sun\" fame) as a conceited judge, Kathleen Quinlan as a bereaved parent, Bruce Norris as Cheeseman, Grace's super nerd lawyer, Dan Hedaya as O'Reilly the evil tannery owner and Stephen Fry as a very English geologist. And who should pop up at the end as a bankruptcy judge but Kathy Bates. This is a case where I have read the book (by Jonathan Harr) and for the movie the film makers have rather sidelined the plaintiff/victims and focused more on Jan's manic prosecution of the case. This helps the drama but does give the impression that the plaintiffs were helpless bystanders. This was not so, as the book shows. As a movie this one succeeds very well. Some have complained it's a bit slow and requires rather too much legal knowledge from ordinary filmgoers but there is plenty of tension and the ending is as satisfactory as one gets in real life. It's a movie to make a lawyer cringe, and that is probably recommendation enough.",
         "Personal injury lawyer Jan Schlichtmann is approached by a group of families who believe they are being poisoned by a toxic waste dump near their water supply as many of their children have developed leukemia. Two of America's biggest law firms defend the case which stretches over 9 years and threatens to bankrupt Schlichtmann's firm and all it's staff. I approached this film with firm expectations. I work as an environmental consultant and in part of my law training I was advised to read the book as it was a good case study (albeit a 500 page case study) on a environmental case. The book was fascinating if a little heavy in detail. For the film I knew that much of it was going to be trimmed but I didn't realize how much. The `trimmed' bit is the whole case! There is none of the trial instead any court room scenes are more focused on the characters than the case. As a film this still plays well and is entertaining if not enlightening or interesting. It still carries the mantle of being `true' but without any of the book's case detail it is never more than a Grisham-esque drama despite having a better ending. The cast are great \u0096 easily turning out for a worthy film and they are rewarded because the characters get much better treatment than the facts. Travolta does well but doesn't manage to be as real as the book's portrayal of Schlichtmann. Duvall is good while the rest of the cast are very much support but manage to be deep. When names like William H Macy, Shalhoub, John Lithgow, Kathleen Quinlan, Stephen Fry, Dan Hedaya and James Gandolfini are all in support then you rightly expect it to be a very worthy film. Overall this is a good film that is entertaining. There is a more powerful, more interesting and moving captivating story at it's heart \u0096 anyone wanting that story should read the book.",
         "On my first viewing of this, on VHS, I thought it okay but nothing special. I caught a break, being able to obtain the DVD for almost no cost, so I looked at it again. Wow, am I glad. I loved it the second time. The DVD brings out the cinematography which is very, very good and the picture is razor-sharp. One of Hollywood''s Hall Of Fame photographers, Conrad Hall, shot this film. Story-wise, the courtroom scenes were the most dramatic of the film but this story dealt more with the behind-the-scenes digging of information to expose thoughtless businessmen who had dumped poison in an area and people were suffering because of it. It is supposedly-based on a true story. Another big highlight of this movie is great performance by John Travolta, perhaps his best work ever. Just the pauses and looks on his face alone greatly enhanced his performance. He was just fascinating. Language-wise, this is pretty tame except for William H. Macy, who loses his cool a few times as the assistant lawyer/financial man for the law firm battling the polluters. It's easy to get involved with the story, but don't overlook the great photography in here.",
         "Starting the film as the traditional stereotypical lowlife lawyer, John Travolta is actually superb as his character develops into someone who actually cares about his clients, and about people other than himself. Robert Duvall is excellent as his opposing counsel, and his character's interplay in the courtroom drama with Travolta is worth seeing the film for alone. Duvall plays quirky characters like few else in modern cinema. Given the job of prosecuting a tannery over water pollution that has led to the death of many children, this is well written and structured - as well as being brilliantly acted and well directed. The one complaint I would have is that this petered out a little in the finish, which was perhaps inevitable as it's a true story, and sometimes the climax of real life isn't as good as in fiction.",
         "As far as courtroom dramas go, this is by no means great. I've seen plenty of them, as American law system interests me. The greatest would arguably be A Few Good Men... this is pretty much in the order end of the spectrum, being a fairly slight courtroom drama. It has just enough good points to it to keep it above average, but only *just* enough. I think the way the story was told was fairly standard, but good anyway. I liked Travolta's voice-overs, and liked the fact that it's not the typical cliché-like ending, where, against all odds, the case is won. I won't tell you exactly how it ends, but the ending is pretty good, and not as predictable as many of the courtroom dramas are. The plot is good, and develops, at least in the beginning, pretty good, and with a good pace. However, somewhere in the last half, the pace drops and you find yourself being bored with the film. Too bad, since it started out so promising. The acting is very good; Duvall and Travolta are obviously good, but Macy and Lithgow were surprisingly good(not that they're typically bad, though). The supporting cast also do their jobs well. The characters are well-written, credible, and well-casted. The humor, though rare in the film, is mostly good. All in all, a pretty good courtroom drama, based on a true story, and a basic story of inexperienced against experienced, as they say in the featurette on the DVD. I recommend it to fans of courtroom dramas, and fans of any of the actors. 7/10",
         "John Travolta gives a dandy performance as a cocky Boston personal injury lawyer who heads up a small but burgeoning firm, almost passing up on headline-making case of a major food company subsidiary found to be dumping toxic chemicals into the water supply of a small-town Massachusettes town, causing many of the children there to get sick or die. Neatly directed and scripted film from Jonathan Harr's factual book allows for both legal statistics and some dry legal humor, and avoids exploiting an emotionally-wrenching theme (the death of children) for hug-tugging sentiment. The film is direct and compact, pausing only occasionally for a dramatic character turn, and is handsomely-made if not terrifically entertaining. Travolta and nemesis lawyer Robert Duvall (smiling like the Cheshire Cat) are wonderful to watch sparring with one another, and the specifics of the case are intriguing. **1/2 from ****",
         "John Travolta gives a pretty good performance here in Steve Zaillan's (scripter of Schindler's List) Civil Action as a hot shot lawyer who gets a case of people in a small town poisoned by the local water. Then the lawsuit begins, though we learn more here than any Grisham film. A film about being humane and trying to do the right thing over money. The entire supporting cast is a big boost, including Robert Duvall as the opposing attorney, William H. Macy, Tony Shalhoub as Travolta's attorney's, Kathleen Quinlann who is the heart of the movie and James Gandolfini as a resident. A",
         "SPOILERS. Actually this is a pretty well-done movie about environmental law. There have been quite a few of them around over the last decade or so but this is one of the better ones. It follows the usual configuration -- the lone hero beginning as a materialist and contracting a bad case of ideals, making sacrifices, risking everything. But in this case it's an entire law firm instead of just one guy, and basically they lose the case. John Travolta, ably supported by Bill Macy and others, is Jan Schlichtmann, a \"personal injury lawyer\" (we know what that means) is approached by a woman who, along with eight others in Woburn, have lost children because the drinking water was polluted with toxic waste. He is sympathetic but he demurs, seeing an expensive case from which he will profit only if he wins, and no money in the pockets of the guy who owns the polluting tannery. Then he discovers that the land is owned by W. R. Grace and Beatrice, two mega giant corporations. Between them they own every brand name you can think of. They own Heinz ketchup. Travolta can think of 57 different ways of squeezing $150 million out of them. The scent of pelf sets Travolta's Darwinian points aquiver. But, as they say, pride goeth before a fall. The salivating Travolta brings suit and is opposed by Robert Duvall, playing Jerry Facher. (All of these are real people with real names.) The movie doesn't give Travolta an obvious flaw like Paul Newman's disillusioned alcoholism in \"The Verdict,\" but it doesn't hagiographize him either. He has more guts than brains. He gets caught with his pants down a few times when he makes courtroom errors that Facher is teaching his Harvard law students are elementary. (\"Never ask a witness why, unless you already know the answer.\" You can learn that from watching Perry Mason.) This Facher is pretty quick on his feet and he clobbers Travolta's character, all the while smiling politely, seemingly distracted, fiddling with pens, wrapping a string absent-minded around the fraying handle of his ancient briefcase. It's a very good performance. Travolta is good too. We never know how serious he is about his motives, or whether he has any idea what they are. He stares ahead and speaks sternly of \"eight dead children\" and \"looking for justice\", but at a formal meeting with the two mega giant's lawyers he makes such impossible financial demands that they walk out on him -- and he never discussed his plans with his partners. While the jury is out, Duvall offers him TWENTY million bucks to settle and Travolta oozes dignity as he rips up the offer and tosses it in the trash, to Duvall's amusement. Well, he may seem like Gary Cooper in \"High Noon,\" but when you come right down to it he, like Cooper, is playacting. What happened to the interests of his clients? Heroic gestures in the pursuit of self-aggrandizement aren't going to help the families of those \"dead children\" living up there in Nowheresville. Stripped of the frame the film tries to give him -- a selfish man who discovers he has ideals -- Schlichtmann becomes not just an ambulance chaser but an ambulance chaser who overreached. In the end Travolta's firm, largely because of his own intransigence, sees the suit against Beatrice thrown out and has to settle for eight million from W. R. Grace. The meeting between Travolta and Sidney Pollack, playing Grace's representative, is hilarious. Travolta walks into the Harvard Club to meet Pollack, carrying a bundle of facts, all business and formality. But Pollack, like Duval, is way ahead of him in every regard. Man, has Pollack got \"condescension\" down pat. Pollack: \"What kind of Harvard man are you?\" Travolta: \"The Cornell kind.\" Pollack: \"You didn't go to Harvard? Somebody told me you went to Harvard. Don't get me wrong, Cornell's a fine school. (Pause) A damned good school.\" In the end, Travolta goes back to personal injury cases, his partners split, and he declares bankruptcy (after a two-year vacation -- in Hawaii, which the movie omits). He devotes a lot of personal time to digging up new evidence but has no resources to pursue leads, so he turns the case over to the Environmental Protection Agency, which finds merit in it, convicts the corporations' lawyers of various offenses, and levies fines against them while a heavenly choir rises in the background and there is the sound of Sox fans cheering. That was in, what, 1988? I wonder if the EPA would be so zealous today. Here's an assessment of the present administrator from the organization Earthjustice, a prominent, respectable legal organization. \"Governor Leavitt's appointment to head the EPA puts an anti-environmental politician in charge of regulating industries that pollute the nation's air and water,\" said Earthjustice Denver attorney Jim Angell. \"We know from his history on environmental issues in Utah that his preferred method is to exclude the broader public from the process when he wants to make decisions that could harm the environment.\" Of course it's good that the corporate giants were made to pay, even if the amount was the equivalent of a licensure fee. And no need to feel too sorry for Jan Schlichtmann. A book about the case made him famous, and this movie made him even MORE famous -- and rich too. He now lives in the exclusive mansion-besotted suburb of Beverly, Mass. It's quite a good movie. Yes, there's a lot of ambiguity to be found in it, if you don't simply accept it as a Manichaean struggle between black and white, but in that respect it resembles real life, which is rarely anything other than fuzzy.",
         "Engrossing drama about a slick lawyer (Travolta) who takes on a civil case involving the death of eight children from leukimia after toxic chemicals were dumped into the water supply in a small Massachusetts town. Taken at first for the glory, but when the case becomes a issue worth fighting for, the lawyer learns more about humanity and passion than he ever knew. Startling film under the direction of Steven Zallian with standout performances from Duvall, scene stealing as Travolta's pompous courtroom adversary and Macy, razor sharp as always, as financial advisor at Travolta's firm."
