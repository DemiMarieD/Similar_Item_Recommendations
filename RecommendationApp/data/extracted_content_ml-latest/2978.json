      "reviews": [
         "I've always been a fan of Matthew Perry in the sitcom \"Friends\". I still think he was absolutely great as Chandler Bing. But so far he could never convince me as an actor on the big silver screen. Somehow it just didn't work out as well as it did in those ten years of \"Friends\". But this movie is different. I really liked him in this one. \"Three to Tango\" is a comedy that sometimes goes a bit too far over the top, but that also offers plenty of fun and laughter which will make you forget about the few annoying moments. I liked the story about the two architects who will act as if they are a gay couple, just to get that important restoration job. When the businessman also asks Oscar to keep an eye on his mistress, believing nothing can go wrong since Oscar is \"gay\", things start to go really wrong, creating a lot of painful but often funny situations... I guess the fans of the sitcom \"Friends\" will love this movie. I know I did and the main reason for that is because Matthew Perry is playing the role he knows best: the likable loser who doesn't do much right. Sure, the movie has it's flaws and no the story isn't world-shockingly original, but it offered me plenty of laughter and that's exactly what I'm looking for in a comedy. That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",
         "I thought this movie was just fantastic! It is the funniest movie I have seen in ages! Matthew Perry has excellent timing (as already seen in Friends) and really was the outstanding actor. Neve Campbell and Dylan McDermott also played excellent supporting roles. In fact the movie was so good I am going to see it again and buy it when it comes out on video. The comedy movie of the year!",
         "Watching this film the second time, was just as enjoyable as the first time around. The balance between comedy and seriousness is well done, as the stupidity never takes over. Matthew Perry has often irritated me in Friends as he is so over the top, but here he has been kept within better boundaries. Neve Campbell is also in a role that seem to fit her perfectly, playing a sweet, while little wild woman. Dylon McDermott and Oliver Platt are also great in their parts. What made the film work was how believable Matthew Perry is as gay, something he suffers from in Friends as well. So the whole plot works out, with the chemistry between Matthew and Neve working out beautifully. This is well balanced romantic comedy which I recommend. 8/10",
         "This movie has a chance to be cliched but usually avoids it deftly. It's not perfect nor full of belly laughs but pleasant enough. I haven't seen much of Matthew Perry's work, not being a \"Friends\" fan, but I was very impressed by his acting here, his expressions and comedic timing. Neve Campbell is adorable, the kind of spunky kooky girl you wish existed in real life - one of her better roles. If you're a fan of Matthew or Neve, you'll love the movie. Supporting cast does fine, direction, photography, music, all in place unobtrusively. A good director is one who you don't know is there. Damon Santostefano emerges from successful tv shows to do a fine job. (Clueless, The District, Honey I Shrunk The Kids).",
         "Neve Campbell doesn't get any sweeter than this. You've seen her as a bitchy Party of Five chic and a Jamie Lee Curtis style victim but this is where she's at her best...quirky, cute, believable and fun. I think this is what Neve is like in real life! She's perfect for adorably eecentric Amy. Matthew Perry (though not looking his best) is charming and fun and at times steals the show!!! Oliver Platt isn't too bad either. The basic story is Perry and Platt are two partners in business, they're competeing with another set of partners. Platt is gay, Perry isn't. The story gets reversed to where the bosss thinks Perry is gay so he asks him to watch out for Amy with whom he's having an affair. End of Story. Did you get that? Within the first five minutes you know whats gonna happen but its a sweet, big hearted little film that makes you want somebody to cuddle up with :) A must see for Neve fans",
         "I had mildly low expectations on this movie. I predicted it would be a second rate comedy, cheesy, hardly any romance at all, and just was unworthy of my time, even though I was eager to see the wonderful Neve Campbell who I always enjoy in movies and thought that it could not be horrible, hopefully somewhat entertaining. When a few certain scenes happened I thought that I was in for another cliché-ridden rom-com. Then, this film totally surprised me by doing something different and changing itself into a very well done and likable rom-com with cute performances from everyone. It's not your average run-of-the-mill rom-com and while some of my expectations were reached, in ways, other thoughts I had about this film were left far behind in the dirt and I was dumbfounded at what a fluffy and fun movie it was. It managed to be slightly unpredictable, and while it was not that romantic at all, I found the comedy to be easygoing and it was just a lighthearted film. I was in this movie for Neve Campbell and came out liking something different about each character in the movie. I don't know if this movie is a must see, but if you have even the slightest bit of interest at all in this film, go ahead, watch it. I was pleasantly surprised, pleasantly surprised indeed. It provides some giggles and smiles, and passes the time effectively.",
         "It's true. Actors can take a tired movie plot and make it good. And this movie is a lot like that. Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell have chemistry and Oliver Platt was fun as Matthew's friend. I went in expecting the worst, especially since Entertainment Weekly gave it an \"F\", but I really thought it was good.",
         "It takes Three To Tango. So why the rock and roll, not tango, sequence during the starting credits? These credits are James Bondish; silhouettes, but without tango music; a very entertaining sequence in fact, but they point to the bits and pieces nature of Three To Tango. It's a film in parts. But some of the parts are downright funny. Matthew Perry (Friends) plays Oscar an architect who with his gay partner Peter (Oliver Platt , Funny Bones) are after a contract to build some swank building for slime ball rich guy Charles (Dylan McDermott). Charles is two timing his wife with Amy (Neve Campbell, Scream) and thinking that Oscar is gay like Peter, Charles asks Oscar to baby sit Amy because he's fearful of Amy running off with an old boyfriend of hers. Of course Oscar and Amy fall in love but Oscar has to pretend he's gay to Amy to keep the contract with Charles, and this keeps the laughs rolling. For instance Amy gets to confide with Oscar about the sorts of girly things women apparently share with gay men. He also has to deal with the men now attracted to him because they think he's gay. Hollywood has an uneasy relationship with homosexuality. These days its common to have the comical gay friend or two mincing about in mainstream films (As Good As It Gets, Beverley Hills Cop and many others). These personalties are added almost strictly for laughs and they are sometimes genuinely amusing but a good dose of homophopia is necessary to really enjoy Three To Tango. Those not inclined to hate those \"batting for the other side\" will be a bit under awed by many of the scenes in this film but there's nothing new about that. Still these sorts of movies may well be seen to be an important step in the true \"coming out\" of this minority group on the big screen. Judging though by the ill tuned guffaws on air at the screening I attended there's a long way to go as yet. There are often two or three gags going on at once in any case. This film takes the bird shot approach to comedy. Let off a blast of jokes all at once and one or two might hit their target. But still the two central characters, Amy and Oscar, do develop some credibility which isn't surprising since they're the only ones who aren't vapid stereotypes. That might have been not so easy though. I was often still tempted to imagine death mask, hooded, Scream murderers lunging out on the shadows with big knives at Neve Campbell. But she has successfully transcended that sort of typecasting in this film. Her hair is cut shorter and she's determinably bubbly, very different to the haunted, hunted character she plays in the Scream films. Mathew Perry like Campbell is very likeable in what is sometimes an awkward comedy romance, with a gay fear subplot. But overwhelmingly, Three To Tango is often played strictly for fun. Oscar rushes through a market. Instead of knocking over a fruit cart, standard fare for the movies, about six live ducks are thrown at him. Huh! But that was different. And funny.",
         "What you get from 'Three To Tango' is a feel-good (but sort of deja-vu) comedy. It has its own charm, own humour (though very American). Santostefano's direction helps the movie move on a steady track. Matthew Perry's Oscar isn't very different from Chandler Bing, yet he manages to stay funny as hell and never get on our nerves. Neve Campbell's Amy is vivacious, charming, sexy and funny. Dylan McDermott does alright as the arrogant boss. Oliver Platt is decent (although he does go overboard at times). Unlike other more recent American comedies, 'Three To Tango' has a more classy appeal. The background score is very likable. The film is set in the busy city which is beautifully shot. Though it does have its share of toilet humour and over-the-top comedy, I can safely say it's one of the better American comedies, fun enough to watch on a rainy day accompanied by a great background score.",
         "Typical Hollywood formula: guy meets girl, guy wants girl, but girl thinks guy is gay and he must maintain the charade or lose a job. In this case the guy in question is Oscar Novak (Matt Perry), who, with his business partner (Oliver Platt) is competing for a $90 million renovation project. To complicate matters, Charles, the guy in charge of assigning the project (Dylan McDermott), asks Oscar to shadow his mistress (Neve Campbell) and keep her away from any guys. Oscar doesn't realize why he's been chosen (Charles thinks he's gay) until it's too late. Of course it's only a matter of time before Oscar and Amy fall in love and chaos ensues. Perry essentially does a rehash of his Chandler persona from \"Friends\", which makes Oscar a charming, neurotic klutz who makes little headway with women. Campbell's Amy is energetic as the independent life loving bohemian and her omnipresent grin and boundless optimism light up the screen (luckily there's no screaming). Platt, although uncharacteristically subdued, is hilarious as always and has some of the best lines in the film. Unfortunately, McDermott's portrayal of the self-absorbed- pretty-boy-Donald-Trump-wannabe is suprisingly lifeless and the only weak link in the film. Tango is not groundbreaking cinema -the straight-guy-pretending-to-be-gay (and vices versa) routine has surely been done in every medium known to man. Unlike many of its predecessor's, however, it manages to be amusing without being offensive: Oscar doesn't try to \"act\" gay - he does not become a mincing, effeminate, fop with a lisp - rather he conducts himself as he always has. Although humor is the method of delivery, the movie manages to honestly convey the difficulty people must face when, for whatever reason, they are forced to live a lie. Oscar's \"coming out\" speech emphasizes this point, and manages to be poignant and educational without being melodramatic. If you're looking for an entertaining date movie that doesn't require a box of Kleenex this movie amply fits the bill."

         "Oscar Novak is an idealistic, young architect on the rise. Boyishly handsome and funny, Oscar and his business partner, Peter Steinberg, have just landed a career-making opportunity-Chicago tycoon Charles Newman has chosen them to compete for the design of a multi-million dollar cultural center. In a ploy for publicity, Newman has pitched Oscar and Peter in a neck-and-neck competition with their arch rivals and former colleagues, the hugely successful (and equally ruthless) Decker and Strauss. Impressed with Oscar's feverish dedication to winning the job, Charles assigns him the additional task of spying on his mistress, Amy, a woman who Charles guards as jealously as he guards his investments. Oscar's bumbling attempts at surveillance fail, but he does develop a crush on Amy, a beautiful and headstrong artist, who begins to return his growing affection. Much to his chagrin, Oscar may have finally found the woman of his dreams. But Oscar's dream is short-lived when he discovers that the jealous Charles has assigned him this special job only because he (mistakenly) believes that Oscar is gay. Oscar's frustration compounds when he realizes that Amy also believes him to be gay. In short order, Oscar's friends, his family, even strangers on the street believe that he is gay. The very heterosexual Oscar Novak becomes the most famous gay man in Chicago, and his entire life is turned upside-down. When he is honored as Chicago's Gay Professional of the Year, Oscar has to make a decision-will he continue the lie and hold on to the job of a lifetime and a warm but frustrating friendship with the girl he loves, or is it time to face the consequences of coming out of the closet and telling the whole world that he is secretly... straight?",
