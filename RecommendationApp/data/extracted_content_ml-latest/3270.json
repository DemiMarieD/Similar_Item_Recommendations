         "The Cutting Edge is a classic movie and one which I never get tired of watching. The chemistry between Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney really sells this picture, even before you see the impressive scenery and fantastic skating sequences. The script is filled with quotable gems, (It's not like his nose was perfect) and what could be a fairly thin story (that, OK, has been done before) is lifted firmly out of the cliche zone by first class direction, a thumping early 90's pop soundtrack and breathtaking choreography. I can't fault this movie - it's one of my top five - and would recommend it as a family favourite. This movie gets a very enthusiastic 10/10 from me.",
         "Take a handsome young ex-hockey star who could never do much other than skate, a prima-donna figure-skater who finds fault with every world-class partner thrown her way and laughs at said ex-hockey star, and an obligatory crazy-genius Soviet expatriate, send them all after Olympic glory, and you have The Cutting Edge. Lead characters Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeney) and Kate Moseley (Moira Kelly) are star-crossed skaters: an eye injury at the Olympics ruined Doug's hockey career, while an ill-timed fall in the pairs figure skating finals leaves Kate's destiny unfulfilled. Coach Anton Pamchenko (Roy Dotrice) fishes Dorsey out of a construction site and transplants him to the Moseley estate in Greenwich. The fish-out-of-water concept was not as blatant as Pauly Shore's movies, but it was definitely there. The stereotypical supporting cast did its job: Terry O'Quinn is the wealthy, doting father who is either obsessed with an Olympic medal for his daughter, or obsessed with his daughter who happens to want an Olympic medal (the movie never really makes clear which), while snobby fiancé Hale Forrest (Dwier Brown) is forgettable yet necessary to the plot, as is Walter Dorsey (Chris Benson), Doug's stereotypical nuts-and-bolts, slightly homophobic and very skeptical brother. With Breakfast Club-like cost-efficiency, the film sticks to the dialogue between the few main characters, who are on screen for the large majority of the film. The questions are timeless: will Kate marry her snobby fiancé or will passion erupt from the love-hate relationship with her skating partner? Will they overcome the judging bias against ex-hockey players and win gold? Will Kate loosen up? Will Doug gain some culture and refinement? One could say that this film is predictable, but that is a good thing. Films like The Cutting Edge lose very little even if you've heard the story told a hundred times in a dozen ways. Suspense is not the goal here; romance is, and this film serves up more of it than almost every media-hyped \"blockbuster\" I've ever seen.",
         "I was twelve years old when I saw this film. Then, I thought it was great. Now, at twenty-one, I think it's awesome. Some may criticize the \"inaccuracies\" of the skating, but if one looks closely at the credits, world renowned skater Robin Cousins is the technical advisor and skating scene coordinator. Also, the pairs skaters they compete against are also, as far as I can tell, are real skaters. While they probably wouldn't jump into major competitions right away, they did it this way most likely for timesake. It's a sweet love story that is refreshingly free of violence (save the occasional slapshot), gratutious sex, and vulgar language. It is a delight for young and old combining chemestry, believability, and awesome skating sequences. I give it a nine and a half out of ten; if for nothing else, then for the warm fuzzies you get from watching it.",
         "I like this movie. First off, you have underrated actors DB Sweeney and Moira Kelly showing their stuff. It is probably their best film they have made. The chemistry is great between the two. You can tell that when they fly insults at each other. The whole cast does a good job and the scenery is nice. I usually don't like films that use Canada as a backdrop for a US city, but in this case, It does a good job as a replacement for Minnesota and suburban New England. My favorite scene is where they are ready to skate their first performance together. Doug goes backstage and lets out some of his bodily fluids. He goes back to explain to Kate that he always had two helmets and it usually took him 10 minutes to warm up for a game. Kate reminds him that their program is only 2 1/2 minutes. He stares blankly at her and says, \"So eight minutes afterward, I'll be okay\" LOL. I always think of that line when I am nervous and going into something major. There are a few cameos by other skating personalities such as Robin Cousins (who also was the technical advisor) and Jo Jo Starbuck. There aren't many ice skating films out there and there are a few that are good. This is one of the few. TOEPICK!!!",
         "This is one of those movies that show that you don't have to have special effects or lots of money for a movie to be great. This is like a movie from 1940s in which acting is the main factor. The tension between two leads is the structure of this movie. Its a great romantic/comedy movie and one of my favorites.",
         "To those who may not have had the pleasure of viewing this film yet, here is a warning: it is addictive. As others have commented, the Cutting Edge has a rare quality of becoming more watchable with each additional session. The word session as just used is appropriate because this movie is pure therapy. One can only hope that actors Kelly and Sweeney can be brought together again to forge another hit.",
         "I found this movie very enjoyable to watch. The chemistry between Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney is very realistic. Even their arguments with one another appears genuine. Each of them wounded from previous experiences, not willing to open up to one another. All of this taking place in a point in their lives where they are each struggling to find something more out of life and end up discovering themselves and one another. Eventually, taking both of them beyond the quest of a gold medal. The skating scenes are wonderful and the music (especially the scores from Patrick Williams) was incredible. This is a movie that I never get tired of and it keeps drawing me back to it.",
         "The Cutting Edge is a classic example of how a low-budgeted and simple movie can turn into a great and inspiring experience, given proper actors and well written script. All the Titanic fans out there, think Jack and Rose are the best? Watch this one... The chemistry between Doug and Kate is excellent and both actors give very magnetic performances. This is a great date movie, unless of course you fall in love with Doug or Kate (depending on your gender), which is actually quite likely... If not for anything, everybody should watch this film at least for the ending, which is sooo beautiful. I think it was wise to stop the story right there; it leaves everybody wondering what Kate and Doug will do then. The Cutting Edge can well be the best romance I've ever seen.",
         "I watch this movie over and over again. It drives my daughter crazy but she just laughs and walks away from me. The setting is great due to my love of skating which I have done in small measure my whole life. The father and coach seemed so real to me and very much a part of the support system for the two younger actors in the movie.To me the movie is well constructed and acted. The characters appear real to me and take me on their journey of life as well. I did fall in love with Doug Dorsey and I do hope he is doing well now. I wish to thank and creator of this movie and the director for bringing out the best in the members of the cast. It is a classic to me.",
         "D.B. Sweeney is great as Douglas in this awesome romance flick. The following cast is delightful. The costumes are beautiful. One of the good farces in the genre, Cutting Edge will urge the viewer to play the game of love. 8 out of 10."

         "At the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, we see Doug Dorsey battered in a vicious hockey game against West Germany. We then see Kate Moseley doing her program and falling when a lift goes bad. Both have fought all their life to get to the Olympics and suddenly the dream has been shattered. The movie then follows Kate, a tempermental but talented figure skater, through many partners until finally her coach resorts to recruiting a hockey player. Through the difficult training of 15 hours of skating a day they finally prepare for Nationals and the Olympics. A romance is budding and their final show could bend or break them as they try to achieve their dreams of an Olympic Gold medal.",
         "Doug Dorsey and Kate Moseley are both part of the American team at the 1988 Winter Olympics, Doug as the star captain of the hockey team, Kate one half of the national champion pairs figure skating team. They both have a disastrous Olympics, Doug suffering a career ending eye injury, and Kate taking a humiliating fall that she blames on her partner, Brian Newman. Fast forward two years, and both are floundering in the pursuit of their dreams. Working class Doug still falsely clings to the hope of an NHL career, whereas no one of any talent wants to skate with Kate, the rich, spoiled diva. Kate's new coach, the renowned Anton Pamchenko, sees that Doug was a good skater and suggests he try out as Kate's partner. Despite or because of the fact that it is hate at first sight, Doug decides to give the partnership a shot, he who may be the only person who has a strong enough personality to hold up to Kate's. Doug's decision is much to Kate's chagrin, she who will do whatever she can to make Doug, who she considers a Neanderthal, quit despite he being her last shot at pairs glory leading up to the 1992 Nationals and 1992 Winter Olympics. Beyond Doug needing to learn the technical aspects of figure skating compared to skating in a hockey game (especially the fact of having skates with toe picks), the two have to overcome differences in personality, differences in artistic vision (such as deciding what it takes to win) and an equally strong temperament to make their partnership a success. They also have to overcome external obstacles, such as narrow minded judges. But the most important thing they each have to learn is what is truly important in their lives.",
         "Kate Moseley is talented and spoiled. She and her coach have eliminated her most recent figure skating partner with little time to find a replacement. None of the candidates will do, and her coach finds Doug Dorsey, a college hockey player with no figure skating experience as a last possibility. The two are from totally different worlds and argue constantly, but his strong work ethic brings both her father and her coach around. The two enter international competition trying out a new routine that is dangerous for each of them as their respect for each other finally begins to grow.",
         "NHL prospect Doug Dorsey is injured in an Olympic hockey game which leaves him unable to play professionally. Pairs skater Kate Moseley is an ill-tempered figure skater who no one will pair up with after a fall during the same Olympic games. With nowhere else to go, Kate's coach brings in Doug as a potential partner, although Doug has no figure skating experience. Kate is none too thrilled about this arrangement and tries to antagonize Doug into leaving, but his strong work ethic and lack of options convinces him to stay in it, to the point that he begins to like figure skating! The pair undergo grueling, rigorous training to finalize a program for U.S. National championships - and from there, the Olympics and a possible gold medal."
