         "There have been so many romantic comedies produced that it is difficult for a film to break out due to the depth and breadth of the competition. This is one that does. This wonderfully funny romantic comedy takes a fresh approach, portraying a romance involving not one, but two men of the cloth. They are not even of the same cloth as one is a Catholic priest and the other a Jewish rabbi. The girl of their dreams is also the girl of their youth as the three were best friends in grammar school. Now, after many years of separation, Anna (Jenna Elfman) returns and both men fall immediately and madly in love with her. The film is chock full of religious humor and sharp-witted dialogue that keeps you grinning between guffaws. The romance is syrupy sweet and the actors have such great chemistry that it is easy to believe they have been friends all their lives. Edward Norton produced, directed and starred in this gem and he shows himself to be adept at spinning a magical yarn with very few flaws. This was Norton's first directorial effort and it bodes well for his future on the other side of the lens. His work with the actors was marvelous, and his pacing of the film was excellent. The film flowed very pleasantly from scene to scene and kept the viewer amused and immersed. The entire cast is terrific. Norton plays Father Brian Finn and is funny and affable in the role. Rabbi Jacob Schram is played by Ben Stiller, whose comedic star is on the rise. In this film, he outdoes his wonderful performance in `There's Something About Mary' with a character that is just as amusing but more complete, with greater range. Anne Bancroft is also fantastic as the rabbi's mother. She has the New York Jewish mother routine down pat, right down to the accent. A dynamite performance. The real news in this film though, is Jenna Elfman. She lights up the screen with her enthusiasm and her charming girl-next-door beauty. She is dynamic, hilarious, sensitive, sexy and lovable and pretty much steals the show. After her terrific performance in `Edtv, she proves once again that she is a talented actor and comedian. One can only hope that the popularity of this film gives her access to more and better parts. This fabulous romantic comedy is highly entertaining and enchanting. I rated it a 9/10. It is especially funny if you happen to be Catholic or Jewish. I highly recommend it.",
         "This is a pretty good film and I think it hits perfectly the things we all want in life. Great friends and significant others. It is just a beautiful film which I must say (for a comedy) and a Ben Stiller film is pretty jokeless. Good acting, good directing a good story and good everything. There was one thing that was great though. The way Edward Norton used Faith in this film. Never have I seen so much depictions of Faith in a film and actually enjoyed it. I don't believe in church and stuff, but these two clergymen are way beyond cool, they ROCK! My favorite in this one is undoubtedly Jenna Elfman. She is so cool and cute. I mean there are so many beautiful women in Hollywood, but man one look into those shiny, glittery eyes and I'm sold. She has just so much natural glow about her it really is amazing. GOOD CHOICE!!! I can only beg producers to use her more in quality productions, she's pretty, she can act and she's very likeable too. 7 out of 10",
         "Only this time Norton is not only in front of, but also behind, the camera. Keeping the Faith is a funny, romantic and very smart romantic comedy. The three leads are charming and believable, the supporting cast is outstanding, the script is insightful and fresh, the technical credits are polished, the musical selections are energetic, and the tone is so consistently enjoyable that I have to say it's my favorite romantic comedy since Jerry Maguire. Stiller proves again what a surprisingly strong romantic lead he is and carries the whole film, Norton is consistently one of the best actors working and here takes a role like no other he's played before, and Elfman is a real revelation: she's never been this beautiful, confident and intelligent before. She makes it very easy to see why both a priest and a rabbi would fall head over heels in love with her. Keeping the Faith works in every way a romantic comedy should but works on an even higher level thanks to a refreshing incorporation of religion and spirituality. It is in no way heavy handed or dogmatic (or judgemental) in its approach to the subject matter, simply believable and interesting, it's a part of who these characters are. If you like romantic comedies this is a must see, but anyone who can appreciate a solid story, strong characters and two hours of movie bliss will enjoy this film.",
         "I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't expect much from this film, considering I didn't really know what it was about, but from the moment it started it caught my interest. The story of a rabbi and a priest being best friends just seemed so beautiful to me. There is no religious cracks in this movie and it shows how we all should accept one another's religions. Then these friends are reunited with their 8th grade best friend, who comes back as a beautiful grown woman. There is an obvious immediate attraction from both guys to her. The only problem is that the rabbi can't be with her because she is not Jewish and the priest can't because he has taken an oath of celibacy. The good part about this movie besides the chemistry between all actors part of this film is that you don't know what will happen. It's not so predictable and you really feel for the actors which is rare these days. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sweet romance.",
         "KEEPING THE FAITH (2000) *** Ben Stiller, Edward Norton, Jenna Elfman, Eli Wallach, Anne Bancroft, Ron Rifkin, Rena Sofer, Lisa Edelstein, Milos Forman. (Dir: Edward Norton) So did you hear the one about the priest and the rabbi and the `business woman'? Well if that sounds familiar don't let that dissuade you from this frequently hilarious romantic comedy of the unlikeliest of menage a trois in cinema history. Childhood chums, Jake Schram, Brian Finn and Anna Reilly - The Three Muskateers of the 8th Grade of Manhattan - are reunited nearly 2 decades later with a lot of catching up to do when Anna comes back east for a short stint as a high powered brokerage businesswoman (portrayed in full giddy sexy appeal by Elfman of tv's kooky couple `Dharma & Greg') who has her hands full when she finds her best buddies, Jake (Stiller in fine leading man/comedy mode) and Brian (Norton, equally riotous in his directorial debut) are, respectively, a rabbi and priest. Seems the best friends only bonded stronger when their female compatriot moved out of the neighborhood pre-adolescently and shared more than their uncommon friendship: their devotion to their separate faiths. To make matters more difficult in Anna's sudden return into their lives is the fact that both buddies are in love with her but it is Jake who winds up making the first move as the frustrated young rabbi who is constantly being set up on disastrous blind dates by his meddlesome congregation (`the kosher-nostra'). After the initial awkwardness is overcome the two friends become a casual sex relationship that only gets further complicated when Jake cannot handle the fact Anna's non-Judea background must be taken into effect if he is to become a full-fledged rabbi at his synagogue. Brian, meanwhile, has found his libido at its leash when Anna begins to subsist in his dreams leading to a comical revelation by the film's conclusion. The threesome have chemistry to spare and banter so witty and blunt by Stuart Blumberg's script that the pedestrian storyline (will Jake realize just what a good thing Anna really is and will Anna realize Brian really wants the best for her) is a no-brainer (and I have to admit the climax of Stiller addressing his followers with a mea culpea seemed to miss its mark since there was no real sense of him `betraying' his people), the film chugs along merrily and makes light of the religious overtones (one truly funny moment is the depiction of the young Jake sorting through his Jewish rabbi hero trading cards the way one would relish finding a Mickey Mantle rookie card) with a contemporary spin. Edelstein is memorable as well as the sinfully sensual Sofer as, respectively, date from hell and date from heaven for Jake. Bancroft and Wallach also lend veteran character actor shtick with all the nourishment of a nosh at the Carnegie Deli. Elfman has proven to be a lovely comedienne and has always reminded me of Jamie Lee Curtis with her buoyant performances and adds just the right bounce as the tomboy all grown up. Stiller continues his stance as the hardest working man in comedy with another deft, dry turn as the befuddled rabbi and Norton display the tricky balance of skilled actor of his generation (his choirboy persona is perfectly advanced for his good-hearted priest and his knack for perfect imitations - i.e. Dustin Hoffman's `Rain Man' )- is only matched by his straight ahead approach to filmmaking; trimming the fat but keeping the high calorie comedy quota intact. He even gets his former director Milos Forman (who put Norton through the paces on `The People vs. Larry Flynt') for a small cameo as an elder clergyman to get one of the film's biggest laughs (interrupted by a middle-of-the-night phone call for Norton he says he was `dreaming of his mother's sausages'). Believe in love and laughter is to appreciate a wonderful romantic comedy that has both in spades.",
         "'Keeping the Faith' is one of the funniest, smartest, warmest comedies of the last several years, and is a terrific directorial debut for costar Edward Norton. It works on many levels; as a loving look at relationships, on the common ground Judaism and Catholicism shares in compassion towards people, in embracing love, no matter what obstacles might arise...and it does all this while respecting different faiths, which makes this a very unique and special film! Norton and Ben Stiller play lifelong friends, who, as children, meet a fabulous, funny girl who they bond with. Eventually she moves away, and the two boys grow up, becoming a priest and a rabbi...then the girl returns, as a successful businesswoman, and the friendship is renewed...until romance enters the picture! Each character is unique and likeable; Norton is a sweet, funny klutz, endearing in his awkwardness; Stiller is compassionate and quick-witted, dealing with his Temple's matchmaking efforts with wry humor; Jenna Elfman (who has NEVER been lovelier onscreen) is both wise and vulnerable, and totally believable as a person both guys would fall in love with. Major issues are addressed in the film (a Priest's vow of celibacy, interfaith marriages, religious discrimination), and are dealt with and resolved in such a positive, loving manner that you wonder why these issues ever BECOME problems! All this reflects well on Norton, who shows remarkable sensitivity as both a cowriter and director! The supporting cast is marvelous; Anne Bancroft is fabulous as Stiller's mother, Eli Wallach and Ron Rifkin, as a rabbi and synagogue leader, respectively, are equally good; director Milos Forman is terrific as Father Havel, Norton's mentor. Two other supporting players should be singled out, as well; Lisa Edelstein has a GREAT slapstick scene with Stiller, as the Jewish 'Date from Hell', and Brian George is hilarious as a \"Sikh/Christian with Jewish in-laws\" bartender that Norton confides in. There are a LOT of great one-liners, inspired scenes, and a resolution that is both believable and satisfying. This is a 'feel-good' movie that you can enjoy, again and again! I HIGHLY recommend it!",
         "\"Keeping the Faith\" as an adult romantic comedy works well. Norton's timing, both as a director and as an actor are magnificent, and Stiller and Elfman add to this shining cast. The approach to religion in a mainstream film is a new one for me at least with deference being paid to each of the respective character's, and the jokes are basically laughing with the religion, rather than at it. The inner struggles that each man faces with his own religion and the woman that threatens to tear apart their religious selves are the most interesting aspects of the film. The first half is a comedic gem, a laugh-barrage, that completely changes once sex is introduced. It loses focus, changing its story into that of a failing friendship and blossoming love interspersed with awkward and frankly embarrassing moments of comedy. For those who have seen it I refer to the \"touchy-feely confession\" joke. At over two hours, it's way too long for a comedy, and it definitely feels it. It's a good film, but by no means can it be considered great. See it to laugh for an hour if you don't mind chuckling and fidgeting in your seat for the second hour.",
         "\"Keeping the Faith\" is just hip enough to breathe some fresh air into a stagnating genre without sacrificing the requisite \"feel good\" moments in the process. The film's 2+ hour run time is a bit long for it's simple plot, but it manages to stay focused and dish up enough creativity to make it time well spent. A very enjoyable fun flick.",
         "Edward Norton's Keeping the Faith is a well meaning a good hearted comedy about boyhood to adulthood loves and different faiths in the cross fire. For first time director Norton this is a good example of what one can do when he is not shaving his head or getting into fights (j/k). The film stars Ben Stiller as rabbi Jake with some nice tones of comedy in his weekly services and Norton plays priest Brian (Stiller's best friend) that means well. They both love their childhood friend-girl Anne, who when she grows up (Jenna Elfman) becomes the apple of both their eyes. It goes around for a while, and it turns out to be funny and expectable results. Still, good effort by Director Norton, script-writer Stewart Blumberg, and the cast for pulling this through. A",
         "Norton, Stiller, and Elfman are an absolute delight! Edward Norton does a bang-up job of a debut film, keeping things light, entertaining, and very, very funny-- and it's great to see him lighten up after such fare as \"Fight Club.\" A uniformly great cast, a witty, literate script, three scintillating lead performances, and a talented young director add easily up to the best romantic comedy since Woody Allen's \"Everyone Says I Love You\". Take your friends, take a date, take your grandma-- this is one everybody will enjoy, and you'll definitely come out smiling."
