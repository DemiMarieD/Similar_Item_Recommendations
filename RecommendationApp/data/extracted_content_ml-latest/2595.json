He shot the amateur photos with a camera he confiscated off of a Jewish resident. Juxtaposed against these photos of the daily life in the ghetto are an interview with the (Polish?) doctor who was assigned there as well as copious notes kept by the accountant. What is striking about this film is the character of the accountant/photographer and his German cronies that comes out between these photos, taken calmly and seemingly with no emotion towards what they depict, and his notes... which are detailed to the point of noting the praise for a German soldier who uses only one bullet to kill a young boy caught stealing an apple. The demeanor of the accountant/photographer as it come out through his official and unofficial notes is quite chilling."],
