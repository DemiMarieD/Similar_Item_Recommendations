         "content": "The first thing we'd like to know is what we're dealing with, biological, chemical, or other.\r\n\r\nDirected by Joe Chappelle and written by Dean Koontz, who adapts from his own novel, Phantoms (not the greatest title all things considered) is a considerably well put together amalgamation of horror/sci-fi/creature feature tropes. If at times it feels clich√©d and formulaic, then that is ultimately a curse of the cinematic genres it lives and breaths in.\r\n\r\nPlot basically has two sisters played by Rose McGowan and Joanna Going arriving in the town of Snowfield, Cololrado, to find most of the inhabitants dead, diseased or dismembered. A trio of coppers turn up played by Liev Schreiber (shifty malevolence), Ben Affleck (square jawed bastion of heroism) and Nicky Katt (fodder of course), and thus a fight for survival ensues as Peter O'Toole's sharp doctor character comes flying in to become the fulcrum of the story. So yep! There's something very evil and nasty at work here and the makers expand upon the reasons why with a drip-feed mixture of mad science and intelligent thematic ideas.\r\n\r\nThe effects work is more than adequate and the strong cast list perform well up to scratch (nice to see O'Toole doesn't phone it in to denigrate the story). Things are taken very seriously throughout, the makers in no way biting the hand that feeds them, while the requisite insertions of jump - shocks - twists and mayhem are handled with care and attention by the director. You may come away as I did with a hunger to dig out your copy of John Carpenter's sublime The Thing? Which in truth is never a bad \"thing,\" but this is still sturdy stuff, a pic caked in genre cement, and crucially it doesn't waste the time invested by the genre compliant viewers. 7/10",

      "synopsis": "Jennifer Pailey (Joanna Going) is bringing her younger sister, Lisa Pailey (Rose McGowan), home with her for a visit, to the little town of Snowfield, Colorado, where she is the M.D. She's been concerned for her sister's welfare, living in Los Angeles with their alcoholic mother, getting involved with shady characters. Snowfield, a former mining town turned tourist destination, offers fresh air, quiet, fewer hoodlums to associate with, and hopefully an opportunity for Lisa to sort out what she wants to do with her life. The town is very quiet indeed on this late fall afternoon. It's the off-season for tourists, but they also see none of the 400 year-round residents. They drive up to Jenny's residence/office, hoping that Hilda (Judith Drake), Jenny's housekeeper, has made good on her promise of apple pie for dinner. Instead, they find her dead in the kitchen, a terrible look of fear on her face, every inch of visible skin bruised and blackened. The phone is also dead, and noises upstairs indicate an intruder might still be present, so they decide to go quickly to the deputy sheriff's office. Oddly, Jenny's Jeep won't start. Neither, it seems, will any other vehicle in town. Nightfall is coming on, so they continue to the deputy's office on foot. Deputy Henderson (Larry Odien) is also dead, his body looking like Hilda's. But there is another mystery here... he had drawn his gun and fired multiple rounds, yet there is no sign of another body or blood. Jenny gets a shotgun from the deputy's gun rack, and they head for the bakery. If they're likely to find anyone, she tells Lisa, it will be there: the owners, Jacob and Anna, also live in the rooms above the bakery. The front door is locked. They hear sounds and see shadows that suggest they are being followed. They run down the alley and go in through the back door. They are greeted by the grisly sight of two severed hands lying on a workbench, still grasping a rolling pin. The timer on the oven goes off, loudly, suddenly... Jenny opens the oven warily: there are only some cake layers baking. They are momentarily relieved--until Jacob's and Anna's severed heads fall down onto the cakes! Huddled together, they move toward the front of the bakery. Night has fallen and it's very dark. The phone rings... Jenny answers, but there is no human voice on the line, just an eerie, muttering whisper. They turn to leave again... and are stopped by three men holding flashlights and guns. Deputy Henderson had been on the phone with headquarters when the line went dead. Sheriff Bryce Hammond (Ben Affleck) and two deputies, Steve Shanning (Nicky Katt) and Stuart 'Stu' Wargle (Liev Shreiber) have come to investigate. They decide to return to the deputy's office, but as they step outside the bakery, every horn, siren, whistle and bell in Snowfield suddenly goes off... the noise is deafening, and continues for a full minute. Then, just as suddenly as it began it all stops, and the only lights left on are at the Candleglow Inn up the street. It seems they're expected there next. A glance at the guest book in the lobby shows there are only four guests. Faint music starts to play upstairs: Patsy Cline, singing I Fall To Pieces. Sheriff Bryce and Deputy Stu go up to check the rooms... the women follow at a little distance with Deputy Steve. Sheriff Bryce enters one room and finds it empty... he opens a closet door, and is confronted with a vision (flashback?) of a young boy (Luke Eberl) aiming a gun at him. It disappears almost immediately, but Bryce is very shaken by it. Deputy Stu enters another room and finds the body of a young woman on the bed. She has the bruised look of the housekeeper and deputy, but she is also attractive and shapely. Stu sits on the bed next to her. \"You wanna tell me what happened here?\" he murmurs, and then snickers oddly. He puts a hand on her leg, on the bare skin below the hem of her skirt, just as Sheriff Bryce walks in. \"What are you doing, Stu?\" he asks. Stu jumps up, startled, embarrassed, at a loss to explain. \"Looking for clues?\" the sheriff suggests, sarcastically. Stu says yes... but both men know what was going on. Bryce decides to let it go: \"Watch the hall, Stu\", he says, and leaves. When he's out of sight, Stu laughs again, his strange, wheezing snicker, and with a last glance back at the dead girl, follows Bryce into the hall. \"Hey,\" he says to Lisa, leering down at her, \"you wanna see somethin'?\" She looks at him with disgust, and says \"No,\" emphatically. Bryce has found the room where the music was playing, on the bedside radio. He switches it off and asks Jenny to come in. He shows her the bathroom: it was locked from inside, he'd had to break in... but no one is there now, and there are no other doors or windows. Someone has written on the mirror in lipstick, \"Dr. Timothy Flyte - The Ancient Enemy\". He asks Jenny if she's ever heard of Timothy Flyte; she tells him no, he's not a local. From another empty room, they all hear a sound like a bunch of heavy metal chains being dropped. They enter cautiously and find a large pile of metallic objects lying on top of the bed: jewelry, buttons, watches, gold teeth... and more. \"Whoever it is, he strips them to the skin,\" says Deputy Steve. \"Beyond the skin,\" says Dr. Jenny, in an odd tone. As they all look at her, she picks a flat metallic disk out of the pile. \"It's a pacemaker,\" she tells them. They go back to the lobby to discuss the situation. They hear the music start upstairs: Patsy Cline again. A woman suddenly screams outside, \"Help--Help me!\" Deputy Steve shouts, \"Cover me, Bryce!\" and runs out with his gun drawn. Bryce calls after him to wait, and follows, but it's too late: they hear him scream, and when they get outside all that's left are his empty shoes and his gun spinning on the pavement. They go back to Deputy Henderson's office. They zip the deputy into a body bag, and store him in the basement. Bryce tries to radio for help. He tells the deputy on the other end of the transmission about Dr. Timothy Flyte, and asks them to send help from the local military installation, but the transmission is garbled and broken, and finally collapses. They are not sure how much--or if any--of it was heard. Bryce and Stu load as many weapons and lay out as much ammunition as possible, preparing for a siege. The lights go out, they all hear something at the window, and see a huge, almost man-sized moth. The two men fire at it again and again, until it goes away. After a moment, Stu walks over to look out the ruined window. The creature flies in again, grabs him by the face, slams him against the opposite wall, and flings him down. It flies around the room a few moments longer, threatening to grab each of the remaining three humans in turn, while Bryce shoots at it over and over without effect. At last, it flies out the window. Deputy Wargle is dead... his face and his brain, incredibly, were completely consumed in the few moments the creature had hold of him. They zip him into a body bag of his own, and take him to the basement to keep company with Henderson. They settle down to wait for morning... if that's possible. At the editorial offices of Wide World News in New York City, Dr. Timothy Flyte (Peter OToole) is working late. Formerly a distinguished member of the faculty at Oxford University, he has been reduced to writing articles for this sleazy tabloid because the subject of his research is considered fanciful and ridiculous. He is approached by two men (Robert Knepper, Bo Hopkins) from the FBI. They \"ask\" him to go with them as a matter of national security. In Snowfield, while Lisa is trying to nap in a jail cell, Dr. Jenny and Sheriff Bryce are in the next room talking. It turns out he is a former FBI agent, too, who came to be sheriff in this rural county because of an incident that occurred in a raid on a drug house during his former career. He'd opened a closet door to find a child pointing a gun at him, had shot and killed the child, only to find out afterward the gun was just a toy. He'd been cleared of any blame, but had been unable to overcome his guilt. He still carries a newspaper clipping of the event. The boy's picture is in the article. We see he is the phantom Bryce glimpsed earlier in the closet at the hotel. Lisa interrupts their conversation to ask for an escort to the restroom. Bryce checks inside, finds it clear, and leaves her there alone. She is standing at one of the sinks, getting a cigarette out of her bag, when an odd squealing sound wafts up out of the drain. She almost convinces herself that it's nothing, until a toilet in one of the three empty stalls behind her flushes. She goes to inspect them, finds nothing--and as she is closing the last door finds Deputy Stu behind it, leering at her. \"You wanna see somethin'?\" he asks. She runs out screaming. Bryce goes in to investigate and finds nothing. They check the body bags in the basement: they're both empty. They begin to speculate: could it be moving through the town through the sewers and drains? Dr. Flyte is en route to Snowfield with General Leland Copperfield (Clayton Powell), as part of a large, specialized response team: scientists and military personnel, a couple of large, sophisticated mobile labs, and an armored strike vehicle... prepared to deal with whatever threat they may find. General Copperfield asks Dr. Flyte to tell him about his theory of the Ancient Enemy. Dr. Flyte explains that throughout history there have been incidents of unexplained mass disappearances. He cites the abandoned Mayan cities of Copan, Piedras Negras and Palenque; the \"Lost Colony\" at Roanoke; the army that vanished outside Nanking, China in 1939. He postulates that an undiscovered entity that exists deep in the earth is responsible for these incidents... and if not stopped, it could eventually cause the extinction of the human race. They arrive in Snowfield, and Bryce, Jenny and Lisa come to meet them. \"The first thing we need to know,\" says General Copperfield, \"is what kind of threat we're dealing with... chemical, biological, or other.\" \"At the moment,\" replies Bryce, ruefully, \"I'm kind of leaning toward 'other'.\" The team spreads out and the scientists begin gathering data. They encounter many weird and frightening sights... including another pile of metallic objects in the church, in front of the altar. \"Like an offering,\" says one of the scientists. Dr. Flyte corrects him, ominously: \"Undigested remains.\" Over the next few minutes, in a stunning series of horrific events, the whole contingent is wiped out, leaving only Dr. Flyte, Sheriff Bryce, Jenny and Lisa. General Copperfield is last to be killed: a pair of oily black tentacles seeps up through the pavement, penetrates his hazmat suit, and smothers him. Dead, but still standing, he leans over and smacks the faceplate of his helmet against the pavement, shattering it. He slowly removes a large curved piece of the glass from his mouth, regurgitates into it and puts it on the pavement in front of Dr. Flyte. The eerie voice that was heard on the phone now speaks clearly from his mouth. \"My Flesh,\" It says, and as It does so, the liquid in the glass resolves itself into a small, spotted gecko. \"Study it. Write the gospel. But do not try to leave. Witnesses to the Miracle.\" Message delivered, the general's body topples over, and an oily black substance oozes out of the suit, leaving it collapsed and empty on the pavement. They take shelter in one of the mobile labs. Dr. Flyte begins to analyze the tissue sample. Theorizing, they come to the conclusion that this Entity has lived in the depths of the earth for eons, growing to immense size, and absorbing knowledge from its prey. It can separate off parts of Itself to send as drones, warriors, phantoms... having them assume the shapes of anything or anyone It has absorbed, even of people or monsters from their memories and dreams. With these, It has manipulated Bryce, Jenny and Lisa into bringing Dr. Flyte here... to be Its prophet... to write Its gospel. For It has come to think of Itself as God--or Devil, perhaps because this is what some of Its terrified victims thought in their final extremity: Omnipotent... Immortal... Indestructible. Dr. Flyte's analysis reveals that It is closely akin to oil in Its chemical composition. He tells the others that there is a manmade bacterium among the samples in the lab that was developed to break up and disperse oil spills. IF...they can culture enough of it, and IF...they can figure out a way to deliver it, and IF...they can draw the whole mass of It to them long enough to infect It... they MIGHT be able to destroy It. (Bryce asks Dr. Flyte if this will work, and Dr. Flyte says yes, then adds, \"Unless there's a nucleus, a small inner mass, that can tear itself away from the core and survive on its own.\" \"You know,\" says Bryce, \"I really just wanted you to say yes, there.\") The bacterium is cultured, and loaded into glass vials to be launched by compressed-air guns of the type used to shoot tranquilizers into large animals. Dr. Flyte steps outside, walks up to an open manhole and calls to It. He says that he must see It--all of It--in order to be able to write of It. It remains silent, hidden. He says that he knows It has been wondering what they're up to in the mobile lab. He tells It that the others have been preparing a weapon to destroy It. \"Even after all they've witnessed tonight, they still don't believe you're a god. They think you're just a thing, an animal.\" He waits...still It doesn't appear. His voice turns warm and inviting, as he continues: \"What they don't know is that death is for mortals, not for gods. Show yourself... gods have nothing to fear.\" He waits a few moments longer. Then with just the right taunting note in his voice, he adds, \"or DO they???\" It appears first as a single person, standing silently opposite Dr. Flyte... an instant later all 400 residents of the town are standing there before him. All the people begin to merge and meld into one swirling mass, which resolves Itself into an immense, hideous, upright millipede. Bryce, Jenny and Lisa run out of the mobile lab, and fire their weapons into It... \"INFECTED!!!\" shouts Dr. Flyte, triumphantly. It screams, and begins to flail around violently. Jenny and Lisa run for shelter into the nearby deputy's office, to reload their guns. They are pursued by a drone of Deputy Stu. They empty their shotguns into him, knocking him down, blowing away great chunks of his legs and arms. They pause, finally... he is still for a moment, as if dead... then he begins to sing: \"I Fall To Pieces\". Tentacles shoot out of his arm- and leg-stumps, which he uses to drag himself toward them. They flee up into the ceiling, and he follows... but he is ill, infected by the bacteria, and this makes him more angry and dangerous. \"What did you do to me?!?\" he bellows at the women. Jenny blows his head off with a shotgun. Incredibly, a hand shoots out of the neck stump and reaches for Lisa. Jenny fires her last vial of the bacteria into the neck stump, and at last he stops... the Deputy Wargle drone dissolves into a revolting liquid. The greater mass of the Entity is also breaking up, like oil dropped into soapy water. Bryce follows the last of It down into the sewer. He turns a corner, and finds himself face to face with the boy he shot and killed during the drug raid. He hesitates... a tentacle shoots out of the boy's mouth, and knocks him literally for a loop. The air gun is knocked in one direction, and the extra bacteria viles are scattered on the ground in another. Before Bryce can get to them, the boy gathers them up. He balances them in his hand, with an insinuating smile. Bryce draws his handgun. \"Always this urge to shoot little boys,\" says the drone, mockingly. \"No,\" says Bryce, \"this time I'm going to miss.\" He shoots the vials in the drone's hand... they explode, spraying liquid all over him. There is a moment of quiet, then the drone begins to tremble, and then to shake violently... It cannot hold Its shape any longer, It shrieks and groans as It devolves... with one final ear-shattering scream It is gone, and Bryce makes his way back to the others. As a helicopter arrives to rescue them, Dr. Flyte announces to the others that the Entity has won after all: It wanted him to tell the world, and that's just what he's going to do. The scene shifts to a quiet bar, where an old cowboy (Lonnie Chapman, uncredited) and a young cowgirl (Yvette Nipar) are watching Dr. Flyte on the bar's TV. He's wrapping up the narrative of a documentary about the Entity, saying that a watch must be kept for It... if It wasn't completely destroyed, one day It may return and destroy mankind. \"Do you believe that crap?\" asks the old cowboy. \"I dunno,\" says the cowgirl, \"stranger things have happened. Patty said that Glen was abducted by aliens.\" The cowboy scoffs: \"Glen wasn't abducted by aliens, he run off to Los Angeles... and if you was married to Patty, you'd run off too.\" A strange, wheezing snicker is heard at the other end of the bar. The other two look in that direction, and the girl asks, \"Does that sound funny to you... officer?\" Stu Wargle stifles his laughter, and swallows one of the peanuts he's been eating with his beer. \"No, ma'am,\" he says, with mock sincerity... and then he adds slyly, \"Hey... you wanna see somethin'?\"",

         "Inappropriately titled, like the book itself by Koontz, Phantoms is a surprisingly effective monster movie, especially in the first half. The best monsters are the ones which are very difficult to kill; in addition, these types of monsters can destroy fragile human beings with ease. This is what is confronted here, with humans little more than insects to be crushed and absorbed. Of course, certain insects can cause a lot of damage when they put their minds to it. The atmosphere in the first half hour is very eerie and there's a lot of mystery. You have pretty much an empty town, a couple of young women just arrived, and a couple of bodies - no answers. That gloom & foreboding of doom may not be too difficult to create, but we hardly see it anymore, even in horror films. Even if one has seen this film, however, they may be compelled to watch that first half hour again just to get that sense of doom all over. When some cops show up, things get even worse. Then an entire army shows up and, of course, we think things are under control now, but it makes no difference. At least the pic is consistent with its menace. This picture was virtually ignored on release and I don't think video has helped it much. When the monster is revealed, it obviously takes away all the suspense built up earlier, but it's still creepy going (without revealing too much, the monster is a more advanced version of a famous one from the fifties; think also along the lines of \"The Thing\" remake by Carpenter in '82). Writer Koontz was involved in the adaptation, which always seems to help. Actor O'Toole appears around the midway point as the only so-called expert on the creature, all based on conjecture, of course. He lends a bit of gravity to it all, tho I suppose he's slumming here in a 'typical' fright flic. The rest of the younger cast do fine, with Affleck a bit irritating as usual. I'm not sure what Schreiber was aiming at, but he was almost as creepy as the creature. There's a bit of a twist ending, which wasn't really necessary.",
         "In the peaceful town of Snowfield, Colorado something evil has wiped out the community. And now, it's up to a group of people to stop it, or at least get out of Snowfield alive. The first time I saw \"Phantoms\", I liked it, but didn't think too much of it. Recently deciding to rent it again for the hell of it, this film is so much better than the previous viewing, I mean REALLY good, one of the best Hollywood-produced horror films I've seen in a while, not to mention THE best Dean Koontz adaptation. Joe Chappelle, who's films in the past unfortunately haven't been very good, does an excellent job directing here, delivering a dark & genuinely haunting atmosphere, not to mention great cinematography and a strong visual style. This film proves he's capable of directing a good movie if he's given a strong script. Oh, that brings me to the script, which Koontz penned himself, having been (Quite understandably) disappointed in the previous adaptations, has done an excellent job with the screenplay. Not only is it intelligent and thought-provoking but is also tightly written. When was the last time we got a SMART horror film? OK, there are plenty out there, but not many that Hollywood have made recently, mind you! Performance-wise, everyone does a great job here, especially the creepy Liev Schreiber (scream 2). Special effects are carefully used, few and far between but generally quite good. Once we finally see the creature it's kind of disappointing (I wish they had used the giant winged serpent described in the book) and quite vague. There's some nice gore too. \"Phantoms\" is a smart, creepy, underrated horror gem that deserves better than it's gotten and really makes you think. 9/10.",
         "Two sisters travel to a small Colorado town to find that the inhabitants are either dead or missing. Situations including power failures, strange voices on the telephone and mysterious writing inside a windowless room locked from the inside referring to `Timothy Flyte - the ancient warrior'. When they are joined by a group of local sheriffs the same mysterious force begins to target them. Meanwhile the military prepare to enter the town with historian Timothy Flyte whose links to the happenings may be stronger that he wants. In `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' Ben Affleck makes fun of the string of films he is obliged by Miramax to carry out, most of them being rubbish! Unfortunately he includes this in that joke. I say unfortunately because for most of the film he's wrong - but ultimately he's got a point. This starts well - within 3 minutes it goes straight into the action, with very little build up. Once it starts it doesn't really slack off for almost 45 minutes. It is genuinely scary because we (like the characters) don't have a clue what's going on or what's going to happen next. Also we don't see anything except the remains if victims of the `thing' or `person' - leaving us our imagination. At the half way mark Peter O'Toole and the military are brought in to explain a little about what's going on - however this just gives more victims for the `thing', allowing us to see what happened first hand. At this point it's still scary because we don't know everything and the special effects are good enough to show the horror in such a way that it is still unknown and scary. However once the truth is fully known it comes down to `lets kill it!' and then it loses it's scare ability. There are still some tense moments - Affleck being stared at by a Labrador is really tense for one - but it starts to head down the traditional path of `big beast gets killed' film. The way they plan to kill it is a bit silly and is a real downer when compared to the opening 45 minutes. The idea by Dean Koontz is very original and well handled however it does have it's flaws (how does `it' know about Affleck's accidental shooting, how does `it' relate from the boy's point of view - did it dig him up! Etc) and these are exposed as the film goes on. However if you ignore this then it's all fine up until O'Toole starts yapping on about petrol and microbes. As with most horrors of this type, once `it' is revealed then it's major let down - the effects aren't up to the job - a thing with tentacles instead of legs is just daft and the total manistifation is silly and vague. However while it's hidden the tension is really good. The final scene of the film is one of those horrible `sequel' type endings (don't worry I have spoilt the actual end of the film!). NOTE TO FILM MAKERS - please don't do this, it marks your film out as cheap and nasty. If your film is really very successful then you'll work it out to get a sequel, you don't have to set it up and cheapen the end of your original movie. Remember Alien3? Ridley died yes? But they still worked it out to get her back for another one (at a stretch but they still did it!). Here the ending makes sense, but it's still cheap. The cast are mixed. Rose McGowan and Joanna Going are both good but have poor dialogue that takes away from their characters. Affleck is poor throughout and Peter O'Tool is not as good as you expect him to be. The worst role is Liev Schreiber, and unfortunately he has to carry many big scenes as the manifestation of the phantom. He is terrible, his character is terrible (nothing about him is explained!) and he ruins every scene he is in. WHY! Overall this is a film of two halves - the vast majority is really good, tense and scary, however the second half sees it revert to a bog standard creature feature with some clever touches. It's all really enjoyable but the actors are mostly poor and the second half needed a lot more originality to build on a great start. Overall - I really enjoyed it - the less you know about it the better.",
         "Reasonable supernatural horror, the action taking place in a small town where all the inhabitants have vanished or are dead. The first half hour builds up tension quite well as two sisters return to the town only to find a few dead bodies and some dismembered body parts. Ben Affleck comes on the scene as a very young looking Sheriff, and the plot sort of meanders along until the introduction of Peter O'Toole as an expert in strange phenomenon. The horror turns out to be an evil entity from the depths of the earth, having similar Devil characteristics to those seen in 'Quatermass and the Pit'. The film is forgetable but is still better than most horror/monster movies that are churned out these days. 'Phantoms' rarely resorts to cheap humour or trite one-liners and, despite the presence of Affleck, doesn't fall back on any romance to pad out the plot. The horror theme stays strong throughout, and while there are obvious ideas lifted from other films - 'The Andromeda Strain' and particularly the metamorphosising dog from 'The Thing'- at least the film remains true to its roots. The second half of the film begins to wilt but fortunately things are wrapped up quite quickly, and while the performances, effects and script are all routine, the story element itself is allowed to dominate and this is strong enough to carry the film past the average mark.",
         "This may have been based on a Dean Koontz novel, but Phantoms should acknowledge itself as being an unofficial remake of an old Hammer Studios film, X The Unknown, with which it shares it's main antagonist. The only real difference is that Phantoms lends a more mystical slant to the idea (though primarily just at the beginning of the movie). As a horror film, this movie is fun...very reminiscent of a good old 50's or 60's horror movie that immediately immerses you in the situation. The one problem with the film is that each character is interesting by themselves, but they don't really gel together that well as a whole. Peter O'Toole is at his quirky best, and Ben Affleck is always enjoyable, so it's really hard to complain about that. The SFX are okay to middling, but work well with the atmospheric cinematography. Definitely worth a rent!",
         "*** out of **** Dean Koontz isn't exactly the world's most prolific author. As a writer, he has the tendency to basically re-state his themes and plots over and over. His movie adaptations are usually messy, as clearly seen by such films as Hideaway and Sole Survivor. Thus, it comes as a surprise that Phantoms is an often terrifying thriller; it's not particularly original, but it delivers the thrills and suspense that it promises . Dr. Jenny Pailey (Joanna Going) is bringing her younger sister, Lisa (Rose Mcgowan), home from L.A. to the small quiet town of Snowfield, Colorado. It's a peaceful environment to live in, with a population of 400, and the town has some nice ski resorts that make it a popular site during the summer. Upon returning, however, they discover everyone either missing or dead, with bodies that have a strange gooey look to it. They try to leave, but find their car and every other vehicle in town dead. Exploring further, they enter a bakery, where they encounter Sheriff Bryce Hammond (Ben Affleck) and his two deputies, Shanning (Nicky Katt) and Stu Wargle (Liev Schrieber). As they look further into town, they discuss what could have possibly caused this massive disappearance and all these deaths. The mysterious cause behind this hasn't ended, however, and as the night progresses, Shanning is taken by an unseen presence. Hammond and the others must now try to survive the night and hope they can get off a message to the outside world of their plight. Phantoms is a surprise on almost every level. It's a well-made thriller from Joe Chappelle, whose only previous major credit was Halloween 6, usually regarded as the worst of the Halloween sequels. He may have seemed like a dubious choice to direct this film, but he does a fine job, creating heavy doses of suspense through some clever uses in the small-town setting and the suggestion of an unseen force lurking around every corner. The film is overall scary, working best when you have no idea what's causing this terror. The unknown is far more frightening, and Chappelle wisely plays this fun material for all it's worth, creating many eerie sequences, such as a slow exploration inside a hotel, the creepy use of Patsy Cline's \"I Fall to Pieces,\" and an encounter with a giant moth that is positively heart-pounding. For approximately an hour, Chappelle keeps mounting the tension level in, throwing in a good amount of horror and suspense into the proceedings in a relentless manner. The last half-hour isn't as successful because of it's need to slow down and explain everything. While all movies like this need to do that, for nearly 20 minutes the movie loses most of its suspense when the characters discuss to each other all the things they know about this mysterious presence. These moments are a bit messy due to the lack of some coherence in putting all the ideas in place. Thankfully, Chappelle brings back the horror and suspense that was so effective in the first hour back into the last ten minutes, and the film ends on a tense note. The finale's reliance on special effects slightly dims some of the highly suspenseful suggestive forces at work that was so effective in the first hour, but Chappelle still keeps the action moving. Dean Koontz's script is somwhat successful. He builds in some intriguing ideas that are never fully explored, but to his credit, he had budgetary limitations and had to work with a 96-minute running time. As a result, the pacing is often so fast, you'll probably wish the film was at least another 15 minutes long. The script is sometimes heavily reliant on many horror cliches, including people walking into dangerous places alone, which is something a character in this sort of film should learn not to do. But Chappelle still handles these scenes remarkably well, creating suspense in certain spots when it often hasn't worked in other movies. There are also some lapses in logic, but they can be ignored rather easily. The film has many strong elements. The visual effects are quite good, such as the giant moth and the other strange creature designs. The setting is among the film's best assets. Smalll towns are usually great places to hide an unseen menace and this film pulls it off quite well. Many of the empty buildings, mainly the hotel and the police station, are great set-ups for some well-done setpieces. The cast is good, and is one of the main reasons this thriller is as effective as it is. After having seen so many badly acted thrillers (i.e. Urban Legend, I Know What You Did Last Summer), it's great to see a talented cast at work. Ben Affleck is fine and charismatic in the lead role; he's a strong presence and creates a likable character, as he usually does in his films. The lovely Joanna Going is likewise equally good as the film's strong female character. She brings dignity and class to her performance. Liev Schrieber and Peter O'Toole are perhaps the scene stealers, with their mostly successful attempts at humor. Schrieber is mostly over-the-top, and often creepy, while O'Toole is wry and sarcastic. It's a bit odd to see such a legendary actor in a film like this, but he plays the role in the right manner. The only weak link in the acting is Rose Mcgowan, who seems more suited for jokey, \"hip\" horror films rather than a serious one, and she's sorely out of place here. David Williams' score is creepy and good in creating some tension. It sounds somewhat derivative of the works of Ennio Morricone, but it still blends well into the film. The score is mostly a series of repeating notes, but it actually never becomes a slight annoyance, like John Carpenter's repetitious score in Prince of Darkness. The final scenes is among the movie's flaws. It's slightly darkly humorous, as it is intended to be, but this ending has been done so often, it's become rather tiresome by now. It's obvious Koontz has become influenced by far too many modern-day horror films. Phantoms isn't a classic film, since it has its own flaws and doesn't delve deeply into some interesting ideas, but it blends action and horror into a suspenseful and often scary mixture, with non-stop thrills and tension that keep the material fun to watch, even if the story's not always logical. Phantoms is a film good for many chills on a dark evening.",
         "Phantoms (1998) Ben Affleck, Peter O' Toole, Rose McGowan, Joanna Going, Liev Schreiber, Nicky Katt, Clifton Powell, D: Joe Chappelle. When two sisters drive into a small Colorado town, they find the whole place depopulated, but corpses keep turning up. What caused it: disease or something else? Enter sheriff Affleck and his snickering deputy (Schreiber), who are just as clueless about these unexplained happenings as they are. Then an army of scientists and a professor-turned-tabloid journalist (O' Toole) come into the scene, discovering what wiped out the 500 residents came from deep underground. Better-than-average from a Dean Koontz novel, written by its author and well-acted for a thriller this ridiculous, that really pushes your buttons with suspenseful scenes and doesn't need to rely fully on special effects. O' Toole's character makes little sense, and we don't believe Affleck's chief graduated from Harvard. Running Time: 91 minutes and rated R for sci-fi violence, gore, and language. ** ¬Ω",
         "Phantoms is a cracking film...I'm slightly reluctant to admit this given it's standing (and the fact it stars Ben Affleck) but I went into it with low expectations and enjoyed it thoroughly. Its a fast paced piece of sci-fi/horror hokum with some great shock moments that'll have you jumping out of your seat or cowering behing the sofa..If you're looking for a scary film for Halloween that doesnt revolt, try this.",
         "I admit that I've never read a Dean Koontz book, but I have nothing against the horror genre. I watched this movie mainly because Peter O'Toole is in it, and I also like Rose McGowan for her edgy roles. I was impressed, but not in a good way, by three things. First, the cinematography was awful. Badly shot, it had special effects that looked like special effects instead of being part of the movie. The whole thing looked amateurish, as if it was shot to be a CBS after-school movie (was it?) Secondly, the dialogue and it's delivery was very weak. The lines were delivered as if they were the best words ever to be said on screen and not part of the dialogue, which would have been a better choice. In short, it came across over-acted. Very strange considering there is some real talent in this one. The last thing is the story. Not to slam Koontz - maybe it's not his error- but there doesn't seem to be any consistency or reasoning in the characters. Why is Shreiber's character such a happy goof in the face of such danger? No reason. Why are McGowan's and Going's characters able to pick up shotguns and shoot them like they've been using them all their lives? No reason. For that matter, how is a dentist able to calmly give an autopsy on a gory, faceless corpse that has just been brutally murdered by a supernatural force? no reason. Why not, I guess... This movie left me wondering why it was made so poorly, and more importantly why, in 1998, when most of these actors had decent careers, did they choose to be in this garbage?",
         "I thought this quite a scary science fiction/horror film. I would compare it favorably to \"Wishmaster,\" for example. The special effects were up to par. Peter O'Toole did seem a bit uncomfortable in his role, but the other actors did OK given the limited character development of their parts. The typical \"There Will be a Another\" ending was supplied. You just can't get rid of those darned worms it seems"
