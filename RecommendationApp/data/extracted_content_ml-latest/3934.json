      "synopsis": "The title and credits are in white font over a black background. We open with a saucer shaped spacecraft drifting across a star filled sky. It stops and hovers, ejects a small sphere which heads to Earth. On a lonely highway at night a truck approaches. The driver, McCrary (Kenneth Alton) smokes and whistles to a tune playing on the radio. Suddenly his radio experiences interference, all of the truck instruments malfunction, and the truck engine quits. He exits the vehicle to check the engine. The sphere loitering nearby transforms into light and electrical energy and possesses McCrary. He gets back in his truck and drives to Lab Central, a government installation. A guard prevents his entrance. McCrary tells the guard he is lost. Distracting the guard, McCrary knocks the guard out with a monkey wrench. He walks into the main building and enters the office of Dr. Hubbell Eliot. Dr. Eliot (John Emery) challenges him asking, \"Who are you? What are you doing here? You have no business here. How did you get past the guard?\" McCrary never answers, but the light that possessed him is transferred to Dr. Eliot. McCrary falls to the floor. The injured guard and a maintenance man enter Eliot's office to check on the director. The two men carry McCrary's dead body out of the director's office. Dr. Arnold Culver (George O'Hanlon) enters the computer lab and retrieves an orbital calculation SUZIE completed. He thanks the machine and departs his lab to see Dr. Leslie Gaskell (Jeff Morrow). Gaskell shows Culver Asteroid M47 on a viewing plate connected to the observatory telescope. Eliot behaves strangely, as does the M47 asteroid. Culver explains it as an orbital perturbation. Gaskell directs the machinery to take photo exposures, and then requests that they be developed. Gaskell's date for the evening, Vera Hunter (Barbara Lawrence) is also an employee of the lab. She works in the dark room. Dr. Eliot lets himself into the Insulation Chamber. Gaskell and Culver enter the dark room and review photo plates of M47. Culver feeds more data into the computer. Vera asks Culver, \"Why SUZIE?\" Culver reads the sign above the control panel--S.U.Z.I.E. Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor. Eliot leaves the chamber and walks to the computing department. The computer malfunctions as Eliot walks in. Gaskell briefs Eliot on the orbit of M47. Culver suggests Gaskell and Vera go on to see their movie and he will stay and fix the computer. Gaskell and Vera walk to the car in the parking lot, but before they leave Gaskell frets over leaving work unresolved. They walk back inside. Vera develops more plates. Culver calls and tells the pair that SUSIE is back up and running. Gaskell and Culver meet with Dr. Eliot in his office. They provided enough information to convince Dr. Eliot that it will strike the Earth within sixteen hours. Dr. Gaskell suggests that the military can deflect or destroy the asteroid with a nuclear strike. The morning newspaper headline exclaims, \"Asteroid Heading for Earth!\" Another newspaper headline reads, \"Asteroid to be Exploded in Upper Atmosphere.\" The military arms and prepares a rocket for launch. The lab calculates and verifies its calculation for the launch. Dr. Eliot leaves his office and stands outside Gaskell's office eavesdropping. Three rockets are launched and strike M47. Dr. Eliot reacts like he has a massive headache and collapses to the floor. Initially it appears the rockets have destroyed the asteroid, but M47 reappears. Gaskell tells Culver to get Dr. Eliot. Culver finds him at the doorway of Gaskell's office. A news broadcast indicates that the asteroid is expected to hit the North American Continent. The asteroid does crash into the Pacific Ocean just off the coast of Mexico. Gaskell suggests to Vera and Culver that M47 needs to be investigated immediately. Its behavior suggests intelligence and Gaskell wants to go down to Mexico immediately. Gaskell and Culver fly to Mexico then arrange for a helicopter to search for the object. Culver plots the location and Gaskell flies to it. They circle the area and look. Running low on fuel, they return to base--a beach shack. Manuel Ramirez (Jose Gonzales-Gonzales) helps Gaskell unloading his bags and equipment. That evening, Gaskell, Culver, and Ramirez eat dinner. Vera arrives with some additional equipment and chemicals. In a hospital room, Dr. Albert Stern (Morris Ankrum) and his nurse (Marjorie Stapp) tend to Dr. Eliot in a hospital bed. Eliot regains consciousness. Dr. Stern records his mutterings. Dr. Stern wires Dr. Eliot up to an EEG machine. The next morning Vera and Gaskell go for a swim in the ocean. Gaskell expresses his feeling of dread. He thinks that this is the calm before a large storm. Eliot wakes, light is flashing on his face. Out in the ocean, the asteroid is reacting. Stern sedates Eliot but is has no effect as shown on the EEG. Vera and Gaskell are out of the water and on the beach when Vera notices something out in the ocean. A rise or bulge of something is coming up out of the water. Ramirez and Culver join them on the beach. Dr. Eliot is improving. Dr. Stern orders daily electroshock treatments. Stern talks to Eliot. Eliot is himself and tries to convince Dr. Stern that he must listen and help him. In Mexico, the fog has rolled in, but the object can still be seen out in the ocean. The next morning Ramirez wakes early and sees the giant machine. It is a pair of black cubes connected by a silver cylinder. The \"legs\" consist of a series of cylinders. The top is half a sphere. Ramirez, excited, wakes Gaskell, Culver and Vera. The object is on or near the beach. Dr. Stern reviews the tapes of Dr. Eliot's sessions. He dictates his prognosis notes. He is amused that Eliot believes he is possessed by some creatures that lives off of electrical and atomic energy. Further, they are running low on supplies and are searching the Universe for fresh supplies. Dr. Stern opens the newspaper to the headline, \"Fantastic Monster Discovered.\" Gaskell, Culver and Vera take the helicopter out and circle the machine. They land on the top of the metal object. Gaskell takes pictures while Culver takes radiation readings. The object activates and opens up and the machinery inside is revealed. They quickly get to the helicopter and depart. Dr. Stern dictates more notes. Under shock therapy Eliot's fantasy takes on more detail. An energy storehouse or accumulator has landed on Earth and will, \"Suck the Earth dry of all electrical and Atomic Energy resources.\" Eliot enters Stern's office and demands the notes. Eliot threatens Stern, \"Now you're the only one who knows. And you will never tell.\" Stern bolts, but Eliot catches him. They struggle and Stern is killed by Eliot. Eliot electrocutes Stern with his own equipment. The news reports from Mexico describe the object as one-hundred feet high made of gleaming metal. Dr. Gaskell knick-names the object Kronos--a monster from Greek Mythology. Dr. Eliot leaves the hospital in Phoenix and returns to Lab Central. He reviews notes on Nuclear and Thermonuclear sources. He is now able to tell the Kronos where to get nuclear energy. He communicates with Kronos. It activates and with its base cylinders \"walks\" to the nearest source of energy. Gaskell, Culver, and Vera monitor its movement in their helicopter as it approaches an electricity generating station. After absorbing its energy it destroys the facility. The Mexican Air Force is deployed. The scientists are told to leave the area so the target can be destroyed. Kronos easily dispatches the four P-51 Mustang aircraft. Kronos is back on the move. Gaskell, Culver and Vera return to Lab Central. They take the elevator down to the Isolation Chamber. It is shielded against cosmic rays. Eliot is in the chamber, he gets up and lets Gaskell and Vera inside. Gaskell asks Eliot about a newspaper headline, \"Lab Central Chief Advises H-Bomb for Kronos!\" Gaskell advises against such a move. He tells Eliot that Kronos will absorb the energy and become more powerful. Gaskell admits he has no alternative plan to stop the machine. Later in the day, Vera is looking for Gaskell. She believes she is talking to Gaskell, but it is Dr. Eliot, who is sitting with his back to Vera in the Astrophysics lab. She blurts out, \"Les, there is something you should know, the Phoenix hospital just phoned.\" At that instant, Eliot turns around. Vera stops in mid-sentence. She tries to escape but Eliot catches her. She screams and Gaskell responds from another room. Eliot tries to electrocute Vera, like he did Dr. Stern at the hospital, but Gaskell stops him. Gaskell pushes him into an electrical panel. The voltage surge through his body returns Eliot to normal. Eliot explains the alien plan and Vera records it. \"Here on Earth we have learned only one half of the nuclear secret. We can transform matter into energy. Up there, they have the other half. They transmute energy into matter. They have learned how to create the basic elements of matter, electrically and atomically.\" Eliot advises a reversal process be employed. Gaskell calls the Pentagon to stop the H-Bomb plane. The Air Force General (Robert Shayne) orders the B-47 to return to base. The aircraft turns to leave, but the controls are hijacked by Kronos. Kronos steers the airplane towards it. Just before impact and detonation, Kronos tucks all components inside and sits as a black cube. The H-Bomb detonates, and a mushroom cloud follows. Dr. Eliot returns to the Isolation Chamber in the basement. He becomes ill and falls to the floor. The light flashes on his face and a liquid, like mercury, leaves his body and expends itself on the metal walls as sparking electricity. The H-Bomb reverses as Kronos absorbs the energy. It grows larger, opens, and resumes it search for more energy. Culver, Gaskell and Vera meet and review their notes. They review Eliot's recorded conversations with Dr. Stern. Gaskell proposes destroying Kronos with its own energy. He draws a picture of Kronos on the chalk board. He postulates the two antennae on top are a positive and negative pole. He proposes to set up a field of force between the two poles. \"A concentrated field of omega particles,\" to cause a change of polarity is his plan. Kronos is now headed for Los Angeles. Its destination is the nuclear stockpile at Port Hueneme. Culver, Gaskell and Vera meet with General Perry (John Parrish). He has made arrangements to fly the rare radioactive nuclear materials out from the Boston Institute of Technology. The pilot (Richard Harrison) sights Kronos. He is given instructions as to where to deploy his nuclear materials. The location must be exact. Unfortunately the wind changes and they abort the first strike. The weather station personnel calculate a new course. The pilot drops his load on Kronos and the reversal process starts. Kronos begins to glow and melt. Gaskell observes, \"The chain reaction will keep on until the last stored electron of mass has been neutralized. Kronos is literally eating himself up alive. You are witnessing his death throes.\" Then a massive explosion occurs. Vera asks, \"Les, do you think they'll send any more down?\" Gaskell replies, \"If they do well be ready for them.\" We close with a long shot of the smoldering shell of Kronos.",

         "Yep, it's black & white and low budget but the film has great ideas and is executed incredibly well for the small amount of money they had to work with. The score by Bert Shefter and Paul Sawtell is probably the best the duo ever wrote. In fact, the title theme was so good it was re-worked for IT, THE TERROR FROM OUTER SPACE. Some people have said they think that cartoon animation was used for walking shots of KRONOS. I think it is stop-motion model animation, especially since Gene Warren is one of those credited for special effects and stop-motion was his specialty. Regardless of how it was achieved, KRONOS is about as much fun as they get. The special effects, while dated-looking now were as good as anything else you would see at the time it was released. I love this film which fortunately, has been preserved on an excellent widescreen DVD. The film has an enduring quality about it and never ceases to entertain me no matter how many times I see it. If you just like to have a plain old good time watching a movie, then I highly recommend KRONOS.",
         "Made in 1957, this ultra weird science fiction movie \"Kronos\" is a product of the then unknown UFO phenom and the Soviet Union's nuclear threat of the time. Before I describe this film, I have to tell you, seeing it first, at a very young pre-teen ager, this movie gave me sweaty nightmares of world destruction's dreams constructed by odd and powerful machines for many nights and many years to come that made me hide under the covers. These dreams of mine were terrifying to the extreme, and when I watch this film today, I can finally understand this. A strange movie, made by \"Regal Films\" and distributed by 20th Century Fox, it adds genuine sci-fi terror with the combination of some very effective and occasional cheesy effects, and generally good acting. The story is just weird enough to be believable, which is the mark of a good sci-fi movie. It is a sort of a \"War of the Worlds\" film in a way. The new DVD widescreen video transference by \"Image Entertainment\" is very good considering the lack of quality of the original film's input. The sound is true and clear. The film is in black and white and incorporates many stock footage shots of the era. Some of those shots include the proverbial rocket launches of a German V2. And then there are some very beautiful shots of the elegant first Strategic Air Command's swept wing atomic jet bomber the B-47 StratoJet in flight. Finally there is very rare stock footage of the first supersonic fighter in experimental form, the XF-100 Super Saber soaring. Interesting. To summarize, a giant flying saucer, mistaken for an asteroid, crashes off the coast of West Mexico. Bubbling out of the Pacific a few days later is this giant metallic multi stepped cube. The cube's goal is to suck up all the energy in the earth for it's home world. The more energy it absorbs the more fantastically large the machine becomes. Bizarre side stories are how this cube's energy affects certain humans for it's aid. You have to watch the movie as this oddness is hard to describe. The imagery of the alien machine is often really scary, as in some scenes the monster takes upon an electric greenish tint in the wide screen display and it's electric lightning is the stuff of bad dreams. But other images are a bit cartoonish. Those cartoonish images if left out of the film would have made it a much more effective a movie. Nevertheless on a 1950's level this sci-fi movie is most effective in it's ability to evoke true paranoia. It frightens the beegeezuss out of me every time I watch it and I can guarantee that I will have a nightmare about the giant and massive cubic Kronos, the ravager of worlds, vampire of energy, tonight as I slumber. As Kronos makes it's way on the earth sucking up energy it makes this crushing high pitched pulsing noise as if metal upon rock. Very eerie. The film stared perennial B-movie star Jeff Morrow as the scientist that figures out how to destroy Kronos. He reverses Kronos' polarity! Didn't Scotty do that on the Enterprise once to save the ship? The obligatory cheese cake 1950's sci-fi actress in this film was the very lovely Barbara Lawrence as the wasted film technician Vera, the ever ignored girl friend of Morrow. For it's genre, this movie is recommended, for it's unique story, eclectic acting, decent script, terrifying and very spooky imagery. It still gives me the heebeejeebies.",
         "Scientist John Emory (`Rocketship X-M' ) is possessed by an alien intelligence which foces him to provide information for invaders who are en route to Earth in a huge spacecraft. Astronomer Jeff Morrow (`This Island Earth') spots the approaching ship through his telescope, but he thinks it's an asteroid on a collision course with Earth (never mind the fact that the image we see through the telescope is obviously a saucer-shaped object that zigs and zags insanely). The spacecraft splashes down off the coast of Mexico, and the next morning `Kronos' is standing on the beach -- a giant, rectangular robot with four piston-like legs. Kronos begins it's destructive march across the country, draining power from everything it encounters (including an atom bomb which the Air Force drops on it. Impressive scene). Morris Ankrum makes a welcome appearance as a psychiatrist (insteand of a general, for a change). The plot has an interesting basic concept, but the script is plagued by scientific inaccuracies and unintentionally funny scenes. Jeff Morrow and fellow scientist George O'Hanlon (the voice of George Jetson) make casual comments about `minor shifts' in the orbit of the approaching asteroid -- even though what they (and the audience) see in their telescope is a wildly zig-zagging spaceship. Morris Ankrum is electrocuted when John Emory throws him against a protective fence that surrounds a high-voltage transformer ( Wait a second -- Ankrum is electrocuted by a PROTECTIVE FENCE?). Despite the embarassing goof-ups, `Kronos' is loaded with special effects by FX wizards Jack Rabin, Irving Block, and Louis DeWitt, who are also billed as associate producers.",
         "This movie reflects the cold war tensions of the fifties and captures the history of that time period on film. The movie is interesting for its presentation of modern age technology of its' time and the wonders that technology would bring. Movie goers who have been spoon-fed on modern digital animations and graphics will have no appreciation for the effort that went into this movie. This is obviously no academy award winner; however, one must view this film in its' proper context. A thoroughly enjoyable movie. 8 out of 10.",
         "This film is a great piece of science fiction. I especially loved the fact that every time that Kronos is attacked it seemed to get stronger. You also get good comic relief from George O'Hanlon, better known to most people as the voice of George Jetson.",
         "Although saddled with a low budget, this black and white widescreen (REGALSCOPE) science fiction film excellently depicts the intriguing story of an alien gigantic robot sent to absorb the energy of this planet, and turn it upon mankind, basically \"softening\" up the Earth for a full scale invasion. Starring Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and John Emery, with excellent production design (by some FORBIDDEN PLANET alumni) and a rousing score by Paul Sawtell. It's my personal favorite of the 1950's sci-fi movies.",
         "Kronos is slightly different from other 1950's/Atomic age sci fi's as the 'monster' that threatens the world in this one is a massive robot, Kronos. This was released on video in America as part of the excellent Science Fiction Gold collection, of which I have a copy. A giant object crashes into the ocean and turns out to be a flying saucer. Scientists are sent to investigate, but one of them gets possessed by an alien and starts acting strange. At the same time, something strange rises out of the ocean and turns out to be a giant robot, Kronos. Two of the scientists land on top of it by helicopter to examine it. It then starts going on the rampage, destroying everything in its path. A nuclear bomb is dropped on it to try to destroy it, but this makes things worse as Kronos uses nuclear energy to get stronger. A method is found to destroy it in the end though and turns out to be a success. For a low budget movie, the special effects are quite good and the music score is rather creepy. The movies stars 50's sci fi regulars Jeff Morrow (This Island Earth), Morris Ankrum (Invaders From Mars), John Emery (Rocketship XM), Robert Shayne (Teenage Caveman) and Morrow's love interest is played by Barbara Lawrence. Morrow, Ankrum and Shayne also appeared together in The Giant Claw, made the same year as Kronos, 1957. This movie is a must for fans of 1950's sci fi, like me. Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.",
         "\"Kronos\" is about a robot emissary (which Earth scientists name Kronos), sent by aliens to Earth. It lands on the coast of Mexico and goes on a rampage. The aliens have exhausted energy supplies on their own planet (which it is correctly noted may well happen here before too long), and so they sent Kronos to Earth to suck up energy from our remaining energy resources. Unknowingly, Earth counterattacks with weapons like an H-bomb, but Kronos greedily absorbs all that energy and just gets stronger and hungrier for more. At this point, you just have to put aside the immediate obvious objection that there is far more energy in any star in the galaxy than in all the power plants on Earth, and the aliens should have just harvested energy from them. If you can forget all that, what is left is an enjoyable typical 1950's B-movie, with what I consider to be some decent special effects for the time (except for the obvious cartoon animations of Kronos' march). Jeff Morrow, one of the better B-movie actors, delivers a decent performance as a scientist. Despite its low budget, the movie tries hard to be an early techno-thriller, replete with what was state-of-the-art technology for its time--B-47 jet bombers, missiles with nuclear warheads, computers, etc. And that also makes it a cut above the usual sci-fi B-movie of the 1950's.",
         "As must always be kept in mind while viewing classic SF cinema, one cannot and should not extricate a film from its historical context. Kronos is no exception. This is 1950's SF movie making at its marginal budgetary best. Certainly the storyline taxes credibility, involving alien possession of humans, but the ETs at least have a practical purpose for invading than just doing it out of spite. Plus, the dirty work isn't accomplished with sundry flying saucers and blaster rays, but by a huge robot. The acting is an uneven mixture of serious and melodramatic that oddly adds to the dark overtones of the fims early scenes. The dialogue, littered with quasi-scientific jargon, flows at near poetic tempo. Ultimately, it is the clever resourcefulness of our nuclear-scientist heroes that wins the day. Now that has to be worth watching!",
         "I checked the spoiler box to be safe, but this one can't really be spoiled. There were three images that I retained from childhood along with the title: (1) the huge dome appearing offshore, (2) the guy clinching the babe on the beach and her breasts swelling enormously, and (3) the huge machine traveling along with the rocket underneath and the cylinders pounding the ground and crushing people. Boom-boom-boom! No, this couldn't have been a real film; this is the stuff of weird dreams. I only dreamed I saw a movie called Kronos on TV as a kid with this stuff in it. Then I decided to check a local rental place that stocks hard-to-find films. They had it. I rented it. I didn't dream it. The babe's breasts didn't swell quite as much as I remembered them doing (spoiler!), but the rest was there intact, plus a lot more really goofy stuff."
