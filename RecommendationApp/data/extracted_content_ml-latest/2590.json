         "Kate Winslet and her young co-stars are charming in this film. The children have some priceless scenes which are faultlessly acted and leave you wishing that you could encounter such vibrant children in real life instead of the ones prone to throwing tantrums in crowded shopping malls. The story drifts all over the place - more of a string of events meandering along in search of a purpose, much like Winslet's character. The scenery is stunning, the colours of Morrocco vibrant and the glimpse into another culture is well executed. A fine film to watch if you want visual stimulation, but don't wish to concentrate on a complex story.",
         "A young English mother, Julia (Kate Winslet), packs up her two daughters, aged 5 and 7, moves to Morocco and embarks on a voyage of self discovery. Set in 1972, the film catches up with Julia and kids nine months into their trip. We're never told why she left London, but her artist-husband back home has just stopped providing the rent checks. This is putting a crimp in the self-awareness game. In the process of surviving and searching for Sufic fulfillment, Julia must also deal with her children's growing disenchantment with life in Morocco, and their desire to return to a stable, normal (and English) childhood. Family friction increases when she takes a young Moroccan lover, and a group of wealthy English ex-pats start second guessing Julia's childrearing abilities. There is no big story here, no buildup of drama, and no real endgame. \"Hideous Kinky\" is a study of the family dynamics amongst this odd troupe. The acting is very good, especially the two children, and the on-location filming in Morocco is a treat. This film is definitely not for everyone, but if you are in to this type of movie, you should enjoy it. The single word that I would use to describe \"Hideous Kinky\" is 'honest'.",
         "This film has all the qualities of an exquisite poem: the rhythm of feeling, the power of understated experience, the slender and subtle plot. Some elements of this story--the existential search for identity, the lack of obvious momentum, the subjective encounter with alternative civilisations etc.--are very much out of fashion at the moment, as is evident from several reviews. Poetry may be out of fashion for similar reasons, but probably not forever. I admire this film as a gesture of art, one that enriches the viewer without spelling out a heavy-handed individualistic message. I hope we will see more movies like this one.",
         "This is the story of a Julia, young Englishwoman who travels to Morocco in 1972 with her two young daughters in search of enlightenment. Kate Winslet, of Titanic fame, plays the lead, and evokes the experience of the early 70s, with its innocent hippie culture. The two young daughters, 6 and 8, are delightful and seem much wiser than their mother, who loves them dearly but is somewhat overwhelmed by the world around her. Perhaps it was the sound system, but my American ears missed some of the British dialog and I wished I was watching it on videotape so that I could rewind and hear some of it again. Also, some of the editing seemed disjointed, and episodic rather than a smooth flow. However, I loved the cinematography, the setting, the realistic portrayal of Morocco. Casting was more than excellent, especially the two young actresses who played the daughters. Much of the story is told from the children's point of view, which added dimension and insight. There's a romance between Julia and a charismatic street acrobat, played by a hunk of an actor named Said Taghaoui, who also works at a quarry doing hard physical labor. We get a serious glimpse into his character and his world. One great thing about the film is that the story moves along with twists and turns and, at the same, time, there are culture clashes and explorations of responsibility, escapism and common sense. Always, there is a sense of tension and a constant concern for the children. The movie portrays a time and place and mindset that has a sense of authenticity. I give it one of my highest recommendations.",
         "This is a really fascinating film, extremely well-acted (the two little girls are especially good), whose only flaw is an ending that is a bit too neat. The soundtrack is wonderful: traditional Moroccan music mixed with some very well-chosen popular songs of the period. Using \"White Rabbit\" to accompany Julia's frantic search for her missing daughter is a particularly good choice. \"Hideous Kinky\" serves as a reminder of something that seems shocking now -- just 30 years ago, a whole class of educated Western women sought enlightenment, and even liberation, in Islam. One wonders: what became of these women? Did they remain in Islam? Have they survived the rising tide of fundamentalism? And what of their children? What is their cultural legacy? What burdens do they bear?",
         "This is simply a beautiful film, breathtakingly shot, with wonderful acting especially so by Carrie Mullan. Of the two girls, she rightly so has the [even if only slightly so] bigger acting part. Refreshingly free of a rigorous story line, you can just enjoy the atmosphere and exquisite photography. And, of course the actors. Winslet is her usual self, solid acting, and she's apparently not afraid to show herself in a less than perfect physical appearance, against the Standard-Issued-Hollywood-Bodies culture. A leeettle chubby, she's the perfect reflection of Greek sculpture. Mullan's mimique is very grown-up, Riza is good, though at times her inexperience shines through and Taghmaoui is quite sympathetic. The nudity in this film can be [but should not be] considered daring in this day and age, and is thus true to the film's era. The makers obviously thought something like: 'Shove it, if this arouses or excites you, there's something very wrong with you' and i salute them for it.",
         "Spoilers herein. The perfect movie for me does a few things. The first is that it should take me some place that I have never been: not just a strange location, but a perspective with exotic causalities. It should be deeply self-referential, in that the form of the cinematic vision should convey as much or more than the `story.' The images must captivate and flow, and a significant part of that is the image presented by the actors. What stance they present is up to them, whether they charm or amuse or tease. But it must show deliberation and be consonant with the whole. My absolutely perfect film will be intelligent, and deal with some great ideas rather than fey emotions, but it is nearly good enough to be competently transported. This is a nearly perfect film. It takes us to an era that some of us remember fondly but placed in a warm sensuous Morocco. What's so strange here is the film has a superstar, newly from `Titanic,' but she is there primarily to walk us through the environment. This is an expertly architectural film. Not arty, so much as giving a presence an enclosure that sometimes contrasts with an (unsheltering) sky. It is deeply self-referentially wrapped: it has no goal, just an opportunistic drift. Nothing is resolved, nothing illuminated, no moral imparted. Just as it really was -- a large part of the transportation is to remove us from the need for linear narrative. Thankfully, this is not hammered home by the slight references to sufism. These three: Kate and the two girls, are absolutely endearing. So without guile. It is a dangerous type of acting to act so open -- you need to be bigger than the part, which means more open than this totally open Julia. Small wonder Kate fell in love on the set. She is surely one of the best film actresses alive. It is especially appealing she chose this path, plus `Holy Smoke,' which can be seen as a companion film. I wonder about how small children can act so. Bigger mystery than any special effect I've encountered -- the magic is greater. Makes the viewing somewhat dangerous if you yourself choose to be open. The only flaw is that this is not about any great idea. But the strange thing is that it is about something we believed in the seed of our souls to be important at the time. Richie Havens! A nearly perfect film.",
         "It has been quite a while since I saw this film (I viewed it in the theatres when it opened), but I read some of the negative user comments and decided to throw in my 2 cents. I remember not having a clue what to expect as I walked into the theatre as I had heard nothing of the film and was accompanying a friend who wanted to see it. I also remember being touched by the performances of all involved, especially Ms. Winslet and her lovely on-screen children. The scenery was beautiful and the story was a poignant journey into the life of a young family uprooted from their London home to travel to the Moroccan countryside. As the final scene ended and the credits began I remember sighing with enjoyment and satisfaction at an hour and a half of viewing pleasure. While the movie will not appeal to everyone, I must say that it is nice to sit and watch a simple film that is not bursting with gore, nudity and profanity for a change. A surprise treat!",
         "\"Hideous Kinky\" is not a plot-driven movie but more of a meditation on time and place. And I can live with that. The photography is so rich with colors and beautiful locales, I want to visit Morrocco. The acting in splendid across the board with particular note to the two young girls who were handed quite a bit of duty with the roles. Where this movie failed me is in the character played by Kate Winslet. She behaves with such selfishness and stupidity--not once--but over and over again, that I really grew to dislike her. Sure...she may be a young, naive, adventurous, hippie in the early '70's, but a I refuse to believe she didn't realize what kind of danger she was putting her children in. \"Hideous Kinky\" is a good movie--not great. And it's good for one viewing, maybe two for the cinematography.",
         "Hideous Kinky is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Esther Freud (descended from a certain Swiss Psychiatrist). The film, set in the 1960's, follows Julia, a young English mother with her small children, Bea and Lucy, recently divorced from her creative, and philandering, husband. She is in Morocco, like many young Europeans inspired by the counter-culture philosophy of the time, to explore herself with respect to its eastern philosophy and culture. It would be so easy for a film with such a subject to fall into the trap of using the 'orient' as merely a backdrop to depict fun backpackers engaging in pseudo-spiritual experiments. Or, on the other hand, take a more malevolent track of exploiting the bad feeling between Europeans and Arabs by having the bright young Julia encounter the traditional savage, woman-hating Arab as depicted in most western films, and pioneered by Valentino in Hollywood's silent classic The Sheik (1921). However Hideous Kinky is refreshing as it is fun and 'exotic', but does not compromise in its sense of responsibility. It attempts to show an intelligent, though wayward, young mother with the genuine desire to explore her self internally, and captures the richness and humanity of the country and its people around her, exhibiting their interesting religious life and culture. The feel of place in the film is astonishing. Marrakech, with the narrow streets and courtyards of its old town, dark and forbidding, but also revealing wonder, and the surrounding desert, are filmed deliciously with ambition and assurance. Julia, as well as being part of the 'drop out' European expat community, finds herself accessing different strands of Moroccan society, the common society of Morocco via her relationship with Bilal, a shady character who turns out to be a convict, played wonderfully by Said Taghmaoui, and the higher rungs via her ex-husband's friend, Santoni. Central to the film- and what also complicates it, giving it an added, new dimension- is Julia's relationship with her two children, played astoundingly well by Bella Riza and Carrie Mullan. They, in turn, have their own incredible experiences, good and bad, as shown by their delightful but confused sayings. Julia, unusually in film, is a complex female character with many shades. She is naïve, foolish and irresponsible. At one point, she even manages to lose one of her daughters. But she is also smart, soulful and canny, and from her time in Morrocco, Julia does gain an insight into her self, but it is not the insight that she expected, and perhaps it is a genuine insight for that reason. She is played by Kate Winslet with characteristic heart and intelligence, and a brave choice as she had just come off the safety of the glitzy but vacuous blockbuster, Titanic. Hideous Kinky is a rare thing- despite being government financed, usually the kiss of death for a British film, it is a refreshing and responsible film about an unconventional encounter between European and Arab."

         "Hideous Kinky is the story of two sisters (seven and five years old) traveling with their hippie mother from London to Morocco. They encounter many adventures, new experiences, and interesting culture as they tag along on their mother's search for freedom and love. It is told through the eyes of the youngest girl, and we learn her observations on life, Mum, and determined sister, Bea.",
         "An Englishwoman travels to Morocco with her two young daughters, where they deal with and adjust to the culture and people of the area. Told from the perspective of the youngest daughter, the story provides insight into the Moroccan atmosphere. Based on a 1992 novel by Esther Freud.",
         "Hideous Kinky is set in a time about 30 years ago when it was not uncommon for young British free-thinkers to cross into the next continent with virtually nothing in their pockets. They left their proper schooling and part-time jobs behind to make their trek into a poor, desert country in Africa in search of themselves and their spirituality. And so this story begins with a young English hippie woman who has brought her two young daughters with her on her journey. Though the book is narrated by the youngest of the two daughters, it is not yet clear that this is so in the screenplay version of Hideous Kinky."
