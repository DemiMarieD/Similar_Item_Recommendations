         "Sometimes a movie is too ironic and self-parodying for its own good. This brilliant and cleverly-conceived film, despite having been panned by critics and drubbed by fans, deserves a hard second look by those with sufficient vision to look beyond the apparent formula of the film to see the deft irony that lies (not very far) beneath the surface. This film comes disguised as a romantic comedy. Indeed, it has all the fantasy elements of the genre: endlessly falling flower petals; attractive men and women initially at odds with one another; the protagonist's self-discovery; and (ultimately) a lush, romantic setting. It doesn't spoil the film one whit to say that it even has the traditional rom-com ending of \"girl gets boy\" -- in fact, isn't that de rigeur for a romantic comedy? But beneath the trappings of the eternal quest for love lie uncomfortable truths that this movie keeps sprinkling among the rose petals for the viewer to confront: people betray one another's trust for casual or selfish motives; trusting one's heart to \"love\" leads as often to heartache as it does to fulfillment; what looks like love from one person's viewpoint is often something very different from the other side; being too needy for love stifles talent and ambition; and happy endings sometimes only appear that way. Looked at as an ironic commentary on the imperfections and uncertainties of love and of the fantasy of \"happily ever after,\" this film is nearly perfect. Looked at as a straightforward romantic comedy, it's awful. But there are dozens of clues in the skilled writing and direction that point to irony, rather than romance, as the powerful engine that pulls this movie. Indeed, the movie takes vicious swipes at romantic comedy staples throughout: the magical love story of the girl's parents, on which she was bottle-fed, turns out not to be quite what it seems; most other characters repeatedly fail in their love lives, or succeed only to suffer great loss as a result; and great-hearted social gestures are doomed to failure. Sometimes the irony is apparent in other ways, such as in the flower petals that fall too relentlessly and too often either to be ignored or to be accepted at face value. The message of this film, ultimately, is quietly stark: everything is doomed to fade away, and we shall fade away, too, no matter whom we love or how deeply. Whether we will get scorched by that love before we shuffle off is an open question. This is not your standard romantic comedy message. Nor is this really a feel-good movie. But it is very funny in places, cleverly constructed, well acted, and comes with an important message about love and loss. It deserves a second chance.",
         "I recently saw this movie, starring Jeanne Tripplehorn and Dylan McDermott, for the second time on cable and I think it's a lot more interesting and original than critics gave it credit for. It does have a meandering nonlinear plot, and the lovers destined to be together don't meet until the end; these facts bother some who are used to a formula plot. It has been compared (unfavorably of course) with Sleepless In Seattle, but aside from the couple not meeting until the end, the two films are not at all similar; Sleepless (which I also liked) is much more conventional; every single scene is directly related to the inevitable conclusion.Til There Was You is actually more like You've Got Mail, where the predestined couple are foes before they meet. Til There Was You, however, is much more original and authentic.You do have to have patience with it; while it's part comedy, it's also a bit like real life; much of what happens is peripheral to the central plot. I liked this; you may not.It has several quirky characters, the most entertaining played by Sarah Jessica Parker.I am sorry that more people didn't like this; the harsh criticism will only encourage future screenwriters to go strictly by the book.",
         "I've seen this movie about five times by now and I still find new things to like about it. Tripplehorn is great (especially at pratfalls) and the rest of the large cast is pretty good too. The movies takes swipes at modern architecture, smoking and relationships, and they are very funny for the most part.",
         "This may contain spoilers, depending on your definition of the word \"spoiler\" You've been warned. Being a rather large fan of Winnie Holzman's writing (and a fan of the work she and Scott Winant have done for the Bedford Falls Company), I may be slightly biased regarding this film, but I honestly feel that 'Til There Was You is highly underrated. The few reviews that I've seen site the film's major flaw as a lack of direct interaction between the two protagonists, Gwen and Nick. In my opinion, the authors of said reviews were obviously looking for a stereotypical romantic comedy storyline. That's not what this film offers. Instead, it takes a more realistic approach to the relationships between its main characters. An approach that is round-about and does not offer the quick rewards of a Nora Ephron insta-relationship (try You've Got Mail, if that's what you're looking for--typical romantic comedy but with panache). A major point of 'Til There Was You is to show how intricately interwoven people's lives are without them even knowing it (echos of It's a Wonderful Life anyone?) This means backstory and \"tangents.\" Everything from names to people, restaurants, TV shows, buildings--they all relate to each other. Thus, you can be intimately connected to someone without ever meeting them. Or, as this movie proves, you can be intimately connected and meet someone after MANY years and THEN realize how intimately connected you've been all along. In the case of Gwen and Nick, they know the same people, eat in the same restaurants, frequent the same buildings, etc. but they've never had a conversation and they don't know each other's names. That type of interaction is so intrinsically real that I personally can't help but be enchanted by the carefully constructed scenes. Of course, it can be difficult to piece everything together, which cuts down on the instant reward of an easy to follow storyline (that being another reason I believe critics didn't like it--it takes more than one viewing to really catch all of the details). But honestly, most of the greatest artistic works can't possibly be comprehended in one sitting (if you feel you can pull out every subtle fluctuation of every word in an Emily Dickinson poem by reading it once, you must have missed something...) If you invest enough time and attention in this film, THEN I think you'll see how wonderful it actually is. And, if not, you may at least appreciate the beautiful architecture of La Fortuna, Jennifer Aniston in a \"Rachel\" style role and the well-played characters Francesca (big applause to Sarah Jessica Parker) and Harriet (Alice Drummond).",
         "the first time i saw Til there was you, i liked it for it's cuteness, but it kinda went by slowly...but then i had an urge to watch it again,and i was able to catch more about the connections between Nicholas and Gwen. i love how EVERY time i watch it, i discover some new path crossing i didn't catch before. i really do like this movie.",
         "While many would find this movie uneventful and drawn out, the genius of it comes from the solicitous character development, distinct wit, and gradual, realistic build-up to an ending that renews one's faith in destiny and fated love. The dynamic characters enthralled me with a story that shows very contrasting, but equally beautiful realities: the pain and joy of love. The movie broke my heart over the end of relationships that filled me with jealousy and nostalgia, and put it back together again with the triumph of what was \"meant to be\". Because of the enduring themes of both love and, more subtly but just as importantly, emotional growth, this movie has taken it's place in my mind and heart.",
         "I thought this was a tightly-written, well-directed, superbly-acted film. It moved me to tears. Rang true & clear. Happy ending & all, it depicted the angst & turmoil of the shallow relationships this culture encourages.... the characters did the work & found their true mates as a result. Too slow for American hyper/commercial attention spans, for sure. More like a European film in that regard. Brave & moving. Glad I saw it.",
         "I would like to state for the record that I personally hate romance movies. I find that the characters are usually one-dimensional and the stories are extremely poorly written. This movie, however, was great. I know, a lot of the \"coincidences\" that happen are pretty cheesy, but overall, the movie is incredibly well-written, so it all seems completely believable. The characters are likable, and it's a very funny movie as well. I recommend this as an exception for anyone who hates romances.",
         "I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie. It's a funny, sweet & romantic look at how people are. A sentimental look at how people live and meet. It's not a epic...but it was entertaining.",
         "The comments here seem to indicate a preference for the movie not reflected in the overall rating of below 5. I think that's because the people who love the film are answering a perceived wrong, that critics/viewers want a typical romantic comedy storyline, that completely misses the point. The reason this film is not good is the basics: story details and acting. I actually think the major lead roles were miscast--too old to be college students, or even young professionals (it was hard to tell exactly how old they were supposed to be throughout the movie), and not entirely convincing in their performances. But then the story details were not all there. I liked the concept of the random connections the main characters shared, and didn't have a problem at all with the fact that they didn't meet until the end (although I agree with another reviewer in that I would have liked to have seen something more than just 1st meeting directly to 10+ years later with a child). But it was not very well executed, and details fell through the cracks. Many of the minor characters were so 2-dimensional. Jennifer Aniston's \"best friend\" character was hardly given a chance to develop. The saving grace of this film for me was Sarah Jessica Parker, who was able to cover a range of behaviors so believably in a character that had the potential for caricature."

The two are shaped by this - Gwen a romantic and Nick withdrawn, unsure of himself - as they watch the hugely popular sixties sitcom, \"One Big Happy Family.\" Years later, it is the star of that show, now a child actor gone bad with a history of detox and people always saying, \"I thought she was dead,\" Francesca Lanfield, who connects the two of them, after years of near-misses and almost encounters.

         "Gwen grows up with her romantic mother constantly telling her the story of her courtship and marriage to her father. Nick grows up with an alcoholic father who can't hold a job and whose family, as a result, is forced to move all the time. The two are shaped by this - Gwen a romantic and Nick withdrawn, unsure of himself - as they watch the hugely popular sixties sitcom, \"One Big Happy Family.\" Years later, it is the star of that show, now a child actor gone bad with a history of detox and people always saying, \"I thought she was dead,\" Francesca Lanfield, who connects the two of them, after years of near-misses and almost encounters. Gwen is hired to ghost-write Francesca's autobiography, while Nick, becoming her lover, is the architect who is to design a building on Gwen's property. When Gwen decides to crusade to save her building, she writes letters to the newspaper that catch Nick's attention - and win his heart.",
