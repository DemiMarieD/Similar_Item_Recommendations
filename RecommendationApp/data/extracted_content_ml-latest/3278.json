         "An illuminating, direct, and honest look at San Francisco's transgender, cross-gender, non-gender community. A number of people in varying states of gender introduce their lives, their choices, and their perspectives on gender -- its creation, reconstruction, definition, redefinition, and \"natural\" state. There are \"women\" becoming \"men\", \"men\" becoming \"women\", and \"\" remaining \"\". An Army veteran, a video artist, a Penthouse model and nightclub performer, a porn star, musicians, and writers are portrayed sympathetically (indeed, many scenes play almost as home movies among friends) and without sensationalism. The ins and outs of hormone treatments and surgical modification are discussed. Although some will be repulsed and uncomprehending, the very human tone should, hopefully, negate condescension and encourage understanding. A good documentary that should be seen.",
         "A delightful and even-handed exploration of real \"gender-benders\", the film-maker went to San Francisco (of course!) to find utterly charming and sincere female-to-male transsexuals. We are treated to wonderful interviews with five fascinating people, each at a different stage of their transformation, along with their friends, doctors and acquaintances. Highly recommended.",
         "I wasn't impressed with this movie at all. I didn't find it a warm and gentle look at all. I felt like although they said they would accept that wasn't the way I felt watching the movie. However, it seemed from the way they were acting, saying things like they don't care if people are confused about their gender, they like having people confused, that they really don't accept those who don't believe what they do. I felt that they really needed to show more of the straight, non-transgender point of view. This was supposed to be a documentary and I didn't see all the viewpoints represented. This movie was more like a slap in the face."
