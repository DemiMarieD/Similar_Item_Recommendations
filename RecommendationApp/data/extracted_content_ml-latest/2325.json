         "Sometimes I just need brain candy. When I need brain candy, I can rely on Matt Stone and Trey Parker to deliver. Orgazmo is full of potty humour, blasphemy, and other rudeness. It relentlessly mocks religious zealots, the porn industry, and nearly everything in between. There is nothing good about the acting or production qualities -- in fact, the *poor* acting and production qualities add to the humour, I think, in the same way that the cheesy attempt at animation adds to the humour of South Park. The entertainment value of 'Orgazmo' lies primarily in the situation -- and even if the individual jokes are not fantastically original, the situation *is*. It's just good, stupid fun. Think of the rudest, raunchiest of all the South Park episodes -- like the one where Cartman joins NAMBLA, or the one where the kids start a fad of sexually stimulating dogs. If you enjoyed those, you will probably enjoy Orgazmo. If you didn't appreciate the humour or found them offensive, don't bother with this movie. Personally, my tastes are so base that I consider this one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.",
         "Orgazmo (1997) was the second live action feature film from the South Park duo. Following Cannibal: The Musical, the duo of Trey Parker and Matt Stone satire the world of \"Adult Entertainment\". The story follows the exploits of a Mormon missionary named Joe (Trey Parker) who by accident becomes the industry's biggest star \"Orgazmo\". A sleazy producer makes Trey an unwilling indentured servant. Joe's life is also plagued by his religious devotion to the mother church and his fiancée. Can Joe resolves these problems by the movie's end? Matt Stone co-stars as a set still photographer. Dian Bachar also co-stars as Orgazmo's sidekick and friend Choda Boy. Lloyd Kaufmann (founder of Troma Studios) and many stars of the \"Adult Entertainment\" make cameo appearances as well. I enjoyed this movie. It was real funny and highly entertaining. Trey Parker did a great job of writing and directing this movie. The movie is even better if you're familiar with the porn business or know some of the stars. Too bad this movie was barely released and it seems to have been forgotten about on video. If you love South Park or enjoyed Cannibal: The Musical then I advise you to pick up a copy of this movie. You will not be disappointed. Highly recommended.",
         "Orgazmo is the kind of movie that is cheesy to the point that it's obviously meant to be that way. You can't watch a movie like this and think even for a second that it is meant to be taken seriously, or even that it takes itself seriously. And all of this is clear just from looking at the cover box, so you know from the minute that you pick the movie up that you are about to watch an extremely goofball comedy. With that in mind, you can really appreciate Orgazmo for what it is. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the famous creators of South Park and the hilarious BASEketball, have returned with another comedy, this one with much less taste but at least as many laughs. Orgazmo is the story of a Mormon missionary who inadvertently winds up starring in an adult film in Los Angeles, but who never seems to lose his faith. Trey Parker plays Elder Young, the above-mentioned missionary, and also writes and directs this unusually amusing b-movie. Orgazmo is a straightforward film that has a very obvious intent. It is aimed at the same audience as other infinitely inferior movies like Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2, but it actually succeeds because its creators have some filmmaking talent that goes beyond a simple purge of every disgusting joke that they learned in fourth grade. Parker and Stone are just naturally funny guys, as has become obvious by now, which is why they have managed to take the potential-free combination of the porn industry and a tiny budget and make it into a hilarious comedy. Trey Parker plays Elder Young, a missionary assigned to do his mission work in Hollywood, and in a hilarious run-in with porn director Max Orbison, he ends up defending himself against a gang of thugs and thereby earning a high paying position as the leading man in Orbison's newest porno. Seduced by the offer of a huge amount of money, which he plans to spend on a house for himself and his ridiculous girlfriend (`Jesus and I love you!'), Young agrees to take on the role, provided he doesn't have to do any actual intercourse. Sound like the makings for a great comedy? No? Exactly! That's what makes it so good! This material is total crap, but that's where the comedy comes from! This is a spoof of lots of different types of films, not the least of which are martial arts films, for reasons which you'll just have to watch the movie to see, and it succeeds on many different levels. The characters are hilarious (there is a truly classic moment when Choda Boy explains to Young that, believe it or not, he doesn't get a lot of action from women. The fact that he's strapping a dildo to the top of his head might have something to do with that.), and there are just some great scenes. The movie is aware of its place, and it doesn't try to pretend that it is something that it's not. Get a bunch of your buddies together and have a couple beers while you watch this movie, you'll love it.",
         "I have watched this fine piece of of cinematic brilliance over 30 times and I'm still not tired of it. Literally, HILARIOUS, from start to finish, from the perfect \"porn trak,\" G-Fresh, Choda Boy, Dave the lighting guy, \"Sancho,\" Lisa, T-Rex, all the porn actors, MAXXX Orbison, and my personal favorite, A-Cup. Why hasn't A-Cup been in more movies? This upsets me. This is REQUIRED viewing. Too funny to miss. Giving you a synopsis of the story would be a waste of time. \"What's that? You dirty girl! I can do that!\"",
         "Obviously this film isn't for everyone. It certainly isn't for all of those individuals who take themselves way too seriously, and over-analyze everything. And sure, it doesn't take a whole lot of brains to appreciate this movie; although it doesn't hurt to have intelligence as long as you have a sense of humor. Read the other reviews. Those who didn't enjoy this flick are either so religious that they shouldn't have watched it in the first place, or are overly self-important and humorless people. That being said, I really enjoyed Orgazmo. Parker doesn't just make fun of Mormons, adult entertainment, and super-heroes: as always, he makes fun of himself and his own movie. How could he possibly do such a thing? Well, it's easy when you have a sense of humor. The great Don Rickles once said, \"Laugh. Laugh at other people and laugh at yourself. Believe me, you'll like yourself a lot more when you can do that.\" As for Orgazmo, see it yourself, if you have a sense of humor. And if you don't, then stay away from it. Or get really high and watch it. The choice is yours.",
         "I've seen Orgazmo many times and I always have to chuckle over it. The beginning of the film is fantastic: filled with zingers, and the furious fists of a Mormon martial artist. The concept is fresh: a young Mormon acolyte on a mission tries to make money for a special wedding ceremony by appearing in pornographic films. Director/Writer/Star Trey Parker is great as the innocent Joe, and his South Park partner-in-crime Matt Stone as photographer Dave steals every scene that he's in. The film stalls a bit just before the climactic final scenes but overall, it is very funny and really not as offensive as detractors of Parker and Stone would have you believe. Well worth it for fans of their series, and for people who like their comedy irreverent.",
         "Orgazmo appeared and disappeared faster in 1997 than Showgirls. Part of the blame is the nefarious NC-17 rating which both did not deserve. However, Orgazmo is the better of both films simply because it tries much harder than Showgirls did to deliver a product based purely on shock value. Orgazmo is the story of a young Mormon languishing in the cesspool that is Los Angeles try to convert the jaded populace into members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He fails at that, but succeeds at being the luckless star of low-budget adult film, Orgazmo, featuring a super-hero who wears a weapon that induces instantaneous orgasms in his foes and a stalwart sidekick, Choda-Boy, who wears a serendipitous dildo atop his head. The performances were rather good, especially director/writer Trey Parker as our heroic protagonist, and Dian Bachar, as the scientist turned porn star. While the film was made on a shoestring budget, and boy, does it show, it is earnest, funny, and well-paced. Parker took a mere $600,000 and really crafted a terrific movie that no one will likely ever see. Recommended.",
         "I consider Roger Ebert, of Chicago Sun Times the greatest movie critic alive. But after reading his critic on this flick I realized he didn't get its meaning. `Orgazmo' is not about wit, cleverness or anything. It's not even an attempt at making a good movie. `Orgazmo' is any movie-amateur's dream. Here it is: a movie that is daring, funny, full of inn-jokes, and stuff you can use in your day to day life and make friends laugh at it. Anything better than the Japanese duo that struggles with the pronunciation of English sentences? We've seen it; we know it's true. This movie has absolutely everything. Let me tell you what you're in for: a vulgar exposure of American Society trough Mormons; a sent up of porno flicks (in a scene a black guy is used as a double for a white guy); Hollywood's lifestyle\u0085I mean, keep an open mind and you'll enjoy this one. Rate: 4/5",
         "Fans of South Park will love to go back and see the live action movies of its directors, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Orgazmo even features Trey Parker as the main character, Orgazmo. In this hilarious laugh at the porn industry with a bit of a tongue in cheek look at mormons, Trey Parker plays a mormon who happens to be an expert in martial arts who ends up being the accidental star of an adult movie called \"Orgazmo\". This isn't a fall from grace ride, though, as he keeps most of his morals by using a \"stunt cock\" and keeps the moral high ground. The movie has jokes at so many levels, including actual members from the porn industry, deliberately bad special effects and a plot that is both funny and interesting, albeit in a slapstick comedy way. Provided that you can get over them making fun of mormons and the porn industry, in other words provided that you aren't a total prude, you will love this movie. Get over the lack of special effects and love this for the cult classic that it is. This is a pure masterpiece of cinema, from the people that bring you the genius that is South Park.",
         "Joe Young is a Mormon, spreading the word of Jesus Christ in Los Angeles. He stumbles upon a house where they are shooting a pornographic movie, and despite his beliefs, finds the lure of compensation too good to turn down a role. Trey Parker and Matt Stone had only just begun \"South Park\" when this film was released. The acting is cheesy, the lines are over-acted, but there's something just really funny about the movie. Like their even more amateur production, \"Cannibal\", they don't require a big budget to make things funny. You might have to find Mormons or porn funny to really appreciate this film. I don't know. Of course, if you are opposed to porn or are Mormon, you probably should stay away from it, because you're likely to get offended. While tamer than you might expect, it is by no means a clean film."
