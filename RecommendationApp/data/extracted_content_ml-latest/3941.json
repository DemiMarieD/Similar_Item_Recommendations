         "Sorority House Massacre isn't too bad at all, but there is nothing original or fresh about it either. The basic plot is the same as Halloween (killer from an asylum escapes in search of his sister) and borrows a little from Nightmare On Elm Street (lots of weird nightmares about the killer). The nightmares don't really add much to the film, so I think it would have been better if they had been left out. The build up to the climax is a little slow, but once the action kicks in there are surprisingly a few tense moments, such as when the killer tries to climb in through the window. Overall, Sorority House Massacre is just an average slasher flick. Watchable, but not very original. Also not very gory, so gore-hounds should look elsewhere.",
         "I had resisted renting this for a long time, expecting something very typical and stupid. And in some ways, it was pretty campy (watch for the dress-up session!) but once the horror gets started, it gets pretty good. Beth, a girl plagued by obscure but genuinely creepy nightmares, moves into her new sorority, just when most of the girls leave for Memorial Weekend. She stays back with three others, who, that night, are joined by four guys for a night of fun. Seems pretty typical, right? Yeah, I suppose. But it does get good. Through some study on the dreams, and memories, Beth realizes that this is the house she used to live in until her brother killed the family and attempted to kill her. And, surprisingly, it's not one of those \"what a coincidence!\" things when the crazy brother escapes the local asylum. It seems as if the the brother and sister have some connection in their dreams, and he knows she is at the house. So he breaks free (pretty easily) and goes on a hunt for her, but only after wreaking havoc in town, stealing a car, and breaking into a hunting store to get a knife and kill the owner. It's nighttime, and it looks like Beth's dreams are becoming reality. They even find a hidden knife under a brick in the fireplace that she thought she imagined. Then the brother gets there, and the fun begins. It's not stalk 'n slash, though, except for a few. Three guys are killed off, and then, when making out with her boyfriend, a girl is killed in a tent, and her boyfriend buck naked, escapes, gasping, \"Some guy just killed Tracy!\" Okay, so it is pretty campy, especially because he remains naked for a few minutes before miracuously finding some (girls?) pants in one room. Then the surviving four realize that they are trapped...with the killer...in the house.... Very good from there. The characters are likeable, and the killer is very twisted. It's great when he sees each of his victims as a family member he killed, right down to the end of the climax, which ends so well with Beth saying something like, \"Get away from me, you sick son of a b*tch!\" when she finally finds a knife while he is pulling her towards him. Overall, an innovative movie, if you can look past the many stereotypes, and the cheese. The acting isn't terrible, and the characters become likeable, especially the last two girls. Definitely check this out, just for the really great horror towards the end.",
         "I'd read a lot of harsh reviews of this one before I sat down to watch it, but of all the criticisms, the only one that I felt really applied was the lack of gore. Apart from that, I liked a lot of things about this one. The thick layers of mid eighties cheese for one thing, as well as the utterly generic plot gave me a warm, comforting been there, done that but just keep coming back for more feeling. I found the dream sequences kinda fun and intriguing, even though they had a lot of unused potential. The acting was pear for this sort of movie, ie. not great, but fortunately not grating. Plus there was a little bit of mindless nudity, which did make me briefly grin. What elevated this film above being wholly ordinary for me though were the frequent moments of suspense, and cool, if never very bloody killings. The lack of much blood annoyed me, as gore was clearly a necessary part of the film that just seemed to have been left out, but even without it, the killer set about his business with an almost Michael Myers verve and dedication, which meant for some good excitement, especially towards the end. That about sums it up, as far as I can remember. Definitely recommended, mostly to eighties slasher fans who don't mind there being not very much gore.",
         "Beth(Angela O'Neill)has been battling recurring nightmares since moving back to her sorority after her beloved aunt passed away. There's a man who has just murdered an entire family and seems to be coming for her. Director Carol Frank juxtaposes Beth returning home to her sorority with a man named Bobby(John C Russell)trying to free himself from the cell of a psycho ward. What does happen over time is that Beth will find that the images that occur in her mind and dreams(not just that one recurring nightmare, but various images of Bobby trying at her with a long curving knife)are repressed memories from her childhood resurfacing because they are awakened as she comes to the sorority which was once that very home Bobby killed in. Bobby will break from his cell when he attacks a nurse and return to the scene of the crime to finish what he started..killing Beth, the one that got away. But, other sorority friends of Beth's will unfortunately bear her burden as they fall individually to his twisted wrath once he takes from a hardware store a knife he used to kill the owner. Energetic photography, potent nightmarish images of Bobby and his mean blade in Beth's mind, and a likable performance from cute O'Neill as heroine Beth lend a helping hand in another of those run-of-the-mill college slashers where young adults are simply enjoying life until they walk unknowingly into the knife of a sicko. There are jump-scares aplenty, over and over. The film pretty much is predictable and the screenplay provides ways for Beth's poor college mates to perish. This has those wonderful 80's items we cherish, the lousy fashion, lots of posters of musicians hot at the time, and those glorious hairstyles. The film also shows lots of cleavage..nearly all the females(..but, Beth, of course, who appears to be the pure virginal innocent)show their breasts. The boyfriends are all goof balls(and most of the gals,as well)so that might be another reason to check this slasher flick out. Just don't expect originality, because this sticks pretty close to formula except the added angle of repressed memories.",
         "Mad killer escapes from an insane asylum and goes after his sister (does this remind you of anything?), with whom he shares an unexplained telepathic link. This film is not too bad of its type, but it's just too derivative of both \"Halloween\" and \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" (there are many ominous dream sequences). The main heroine is fairly engaging, but the rest of the characters are almost indistinguishable from one another (and the men are badly acted, too). (**)",
         "This is a Roger Corman film so I was expecting some awfulness to it (ie: Planet 9 from outer space). However, it was a surprisingly good slasher film. Yes, there are a lot of Halloween (the brother/sister), Friday the 13th (couple making out outside) and Nightmare on Elm Street (dreams ) references,but it had its own take and story to tell. It would have been better if they were twins and had a connection that way...Maybe, not. The acting was better if not the same than one would see in any other slasher film. The hospital staff was portrayed as decent and real unlike the portrayal in Friday the 13th: Final Chapter. The dining room and nightmare sequences are probably the best.",
         "A little girl's brother kills the whole family, but she escapes by hiding in the basement. He is committed, and she grows up with a new family, eventually going to college and joining a sorority. Due to memory loss, she does not remember that the sorority house was her childhood home. Thank you, Roger Corman, for producing this cheap attempt at a slasher, cashing in on a craze at the time. You are a producing genius. I am more than a little confused by the \"trying on the wardrobe\" scene. Did it help the plot? No. This seemed like an excuse to play bad music for a minute and show three girls in various stages of undress. While (for good or bad) nudity is a crucial part of the slasher, this pushed the concept of \"gratuitous\" to new levels. The film was written and directed Carol Frank, assistant to the director of \"Slumber Party Massacre\". Clearly that film's influence on this one is obvious, if for n other reason than the title. And Frank has done little else in the world of movies... very mysterious. (For what it is worth, this film is more than good for a first time director... the potential for a career was certainly there.) The lead actress, Angela O'Neill, is unknown to most people, but she is actually now a success in Hollywood -- in the arts and props department. She has worked on such films as \"American Beauty\" and \"Apollo 13\". If this film did nothing else for the world of cinema, it launched O'Neill's career, and has benefited us all.",
         "I found this to be a pretty good movie. The scene with the dolls at the kitchen tables is one of the more memorable horror scenes for me. It gets to be a bit campy, but it is a generally good movie. There is horror, laughter, and as with any good teen horror...naked women. While it is taking a lot from Halloween I still find it to be a good watch and would recommend it to anyone.",
         "The more I watch movies that are associated with Roger Corman the more I like them he's the king of B list short cheap low budget films that entertain. I love for one that Roger did not use any special effects as today's film world is to overblown with CGI. And these pictures do have somewhat of a story despite the blood and gore that is the theme with skin and death. This title \"Sorority House Massacre\" is a tale of a young girl Beth who has visions of the past and when in sunny southern Los Angeles when away at college with her girlfriends she starts to feel strange with this particular house as it has a haunted past. Thru the dreams of Beth she remembers a lot as a connection and past will be learned. This is a film of nightmares and stalker type fun with blood gore as young ladies are a gore target one by one. Really a B list classic that does entertain.",
         "this film isn't that bad. about 10 years ago i couldn't sleep at night an this movie came on like at 3am an i loved it an for years I couldn't remember the name of it an recently I finally figured it out an so i went an bought it for 10 bucks it's not as good as I thought it was then but I still like it only complaint is it's too much like slumber party massacre 2 but this one is better an makes more sense"
