         "...\"Howling II\" is not. It is, however, a comically bad and therefore highly enjoyable film. The plot (if you can call it that) goes something like this: Some Flock of Seagulls-looking bloke loses his sister to a werewolf attack (yet another peril of living in Los Angeles). He and this reporter chick meet up with a werewolf hunter (a deadpan Christopher Lee) at the dead girl's funeral. For reasons unclear, the trio voyage to Transylvania, where they do battle with the queen of the undead, Stirba (the frequently nude Sybil Danning). From there on, things get confusing. There's some sort of arts fair going on in Transylvania, which I thought was vampire country but apparently has a burgeoning lycanthrope population. The Flock of Seagulls dude nails the reporter chick with his pants still on. Three partially transformed (read: hairy) werewolves enjoy a spirited, if somewhat testy, menage a trois. A dwarf's eye explodes. Much fun is had by all. \"Howling II: Your Sister Is A Werewolf\" (its alternate title, \"Stirba the Werewolf Bitch\" had me laughing for days) is, indeed, a terrible movie. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid, and after watching it on cable the other night I can't believe how bad it was. But I'm giving it a high rating and a sincere recommendation because they just don't make horror flicks like this anymore. The werewolf transformations are just awful. The filmmakers were definitely going for \"An American Werewolf in London\" (which won an Oscar for its special effects), but, ahem, \"fell prey\" to their own kitschiness, which permeates the entire film. There are some incredibly cheesy transitions between scenes; swipes, swirls, and spirals abound. And the script? I've seen more substance on a roll of Charmin. But it's great; how often do you get to hear lines such as, \"That dwarf is staring at us\"? Compared to today's era of Macintosh-generated \"special effects\" (which look incredibly dated now, and will look even worse in ten years), a film like \"Howling II\" is a gem, a last hurrah of the last great era of horror films. You'll never see pools of blood or cheesy puppets or laughable laser rays done like this again. Get some beer, pop it in, and laugh yourself stupid. By the film's conclusion (in which Sybil Danning rips her clothes off seventeen times, all in time with a Cramps-sounding 80s band called Babel), you'll be glad you did. \"By the pale, pale light/pale, pale light of the moonglow...\"",
         "I think perhaps the most apt comment should go to Christopher Lee himself who has often described HOWLING II as his own \"personal embarrassment!\" Since we have the film in our own library (in BETA format of course) we are probably the only family world-wide has seen it upwards of 20 times over the last 17 years....never fails to give us a laugh...I would almost \"miss\" it now! We all just watched it again tonight! El cheapo film-making any which way you want to look at it...script, acting, direction, editing, production values, fx...love the early shot of the \"werewolf\" where they have only given the poor guy a \"furry arm\" the rest is normal! But hey...this is a fun movie....how many other films do you get to see a girl rip her bra off seventeen times during the closing credits. Sybil Danning should have received a \"special Oscar\" for this alone! Tries to link itself to the original with the most pathetic re-shot footage of Dee Wallace Stone's demise in the original that looks absolutely nothing like her, not to mention the \"body\" in the coffin. Still ya gotta love the theme \"In the pale pale night of the moon above\".... Hell, give it a break!",
         "\"The Howling\" was a horror movie that had horror in it, Howling II is a horror movie that's hilarious!! It almost makes fun of itself!! Christopher Lee was so funny, he should of won an Oscar! And as for the rest of the cast, they make \"Airplane\" look like a drama. You'd think they picked these guys off the streets. And as for \"Stirba- the Werewolf Whatever\", her character was SOOOOOOOOO funny, she made the film a comedy!! I mean, \"Stirba\". Every time they mentioned her name I had to stop the tape and run into the next room, crying with laughter. Yes, I own this film. Of course, I bought it because I'm a collector and to pass the time by! Usually, you wouldn't find the content of this film funny, as my father found out the hard way, but it's presented in such style that... well, it's very hard to explain. Howling II is so bad, it's funny!! And that's all there is to it!!",
         "I watched two Christopher Lee movies this weekend, Horror Hotel (Lee at his best) and Howling II (Lee at his worst). This is definitely the low point of the man's career. You can tell he did not want to be here and I feel so sorry for him. The \"film\" is pretty bad...but it's funny at the same time. I almost peed in my pants when Reb Brown (Captain America himself) ran into the room and screamed \"BOO!!\" The man is a comic genius and it's laugh out loud funny. Equally funny are the exploding dwarf, the drunken werewolf orgy, and the use of the eighties swipe (that device used to cut from scene to scene). We get some of the corniest swipes ever; a fan, diamond, swirl, and just the classic swipe are all used. Perhaps the funniest thing comes in the credits. The scene where Sybil Danning strips her clothes off is shown 10, count em, 10 times again over the credits. This does not compensate for the crappiness of the movie though. The most unbearable quality about the flick is the lighting. You can't see anything. If there is any werewolf action going on here, you can't see it! It's so dark and sometimes very painful to watch. Howling II is worth watching only if you're a Reb Brown fan or if you want to see Christopher Lee wearing some ridiculously cool eighties sunglasses, or maybe to see some Frankie Goes To Hollywood-lookin' band sing a song about \"the pale, pale light of the moonglow.\"",
         "From the moment Christopher Lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you've got a stinker on your hands! This film had potential. Beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film, if not an interesting one. The final product is a real mess, however. Aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film. Christopher Lee gives it a nugget of credibility, but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap. Having never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one. We start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original, and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves. The film is paced fairly well, and there are not too many dead spots. The action is there; it just isn't filmed well. One bright spot is the music of a punk band called Babel. Though their song is played quite often, it is rather catchy. The problems with this film are great in number. First off, the acting is worse than pitiful. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. The two leads Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are lacking in just about everything you'd want for such characters. The writing is wretched, the editing redundant, and the direction amateurish. There are a couple nice special effect gimmicks, but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number. Sybil Danning is nice to look at, but her acting performance is less than satisfactory. Judd Omen looks the part he plays, but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least. Much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be Latin. I liked the general idea for the story. I always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil. One scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting. Kind of. Maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling. 3 of 10 stars. The Hound. Side note: As of this writing, the censors at youtube.com have still not taken down the ending credits with Sybil Danning ripping off her top several times while the Babel song is playing! Catch it while you can!",
         "After watching this, I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (This has passed over time). This film was utter garbage. First, they tried to recreate the ending from the first \"Howling,\" with incredibly bad make-up. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film! The plot sucks and the whole film is just AWFUL!!!! A brother of a werewolf victim from the first film (From the look of it, it was SUPPOSED to be Dee Wallace Stone)teams up with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, lead by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked all the time. This is not even worth renting (Unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity.). Try to catch it on cable instead. It would be so chopped up, it may actually make sense.",
         "Lee hosted the 100 Years of Horror for Ted Newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves. He said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was The Howling II, then he quipped, \"The less said about that the better.\" Indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances. The first Howling by Joe Dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter. It was a film to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time(See CHUD then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes. Lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning(okay, I'll cede Ferdy Mayne too). Lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things(check out that ending with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave America to go to Romania. The story isn't really worth examining here, and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times(I counted ten - but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point). I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave it are 1 for Lee and two for Ms. Danning's contributions. Yuck!",
         "I have already seen The Howling (worth watching), the vampire versus werewolf Part 6 (fair), and the were-thylocenes of Part 3 (awful). Prior to viewing Part 2, I noted with some trepidation that it too was directed by Philippe Mora who did Part 3. Is Part 2 worse? Almost. Part 3 is more consciously tongue in cheek and plain daft. Part 2 is still a below par horror film. Here are some reasons why: - The American couple lack charisma, spark, and can't act their way out of a paper bag. The film moves at break neck speed with no time for character development, plot exposition (both possibly intentional) and fatally, for a horror film, any atmosphere and tension build up. The werewolves are too vulnerable and exude no threat, being killed in droves. Why bother with the titanium/silver malarkey. The nighttime forest scenes are too dark, you can't tell what the hell is happening, just a flash of teeth, some gunshot, and an axe flapping about. The needless flashbacks to earlier scenes and events grate. For example, a characters name is mentioned, cut to scene of that person, cut back to conversation. Any continuity in a scene is broken and it is patronising to the viewer. Speaking of `flash'backs the closing title sequence is a highlight, with the same footage of Stirba disrobing in time to the music. Superb! You'll love the theme song by the end as well! *spoilers* Some important events are too rushed. The worst example is the death of the black werewolf, Mariana. Throughout the film she is presented as a powerful wolf and a leading villain. You'll hardly notice her death it is so botched. Some moments and ideas have potential, particularly the scenes in Transylvania (where else). The village carnival, the macabre puppet show, and the pursuit of the `laughing ` dwarf through the streets and building (cf. Don't Look Now) have promise but fail in execution. The imagery of old European architecture, such as church gargoyles and grim murals, is a highlight. Mercifully, the presence of horror veteran Christopher Lee adds some much needed levity and style. Last year I saw him in Jesus Franco's The Blood of Fu Manchu and thought it a horror lowpoint for him. The film is let down by sloppy editing and a banal finale. How wrong I was. Here Lee plays a goodly occultist/lycanthropy expert. Those silly wolves shouldn't have messed with the `Prince of Darkness' on his home turf of Transylvania. Watch out for Jimmy Nail playing a `cool' LA biker complete with Geordie accent. Thankfully for him and us he dies before he manages to do any singing. Why else was he at the gig, he was about to clamber onstage. If so they could have renamed the film, The Whining: Your Northern Actor is an Atrocious Singer.",
         "*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* I bought this video for 3 bucks at my local video store. I bought it for one reason and one reason only: Sybil Danning's perfect breasts. The filmmakers knew their greatest asset and exploited it for all it was worth. Over the closing credits, Sybil rips off her shirt a total of SEVENTEEN TIMES! Yes! I counted! If you add the shirt ripping moment in the actual movie, that's EIGHTEEN TIMES! Eighteen shots of her breasts! I felt like \"The Count\" on Sesame Street. \"Sixteen..Seventeen..Eighteen breasts! AH-HA-HA-HA!\" The rest of the flick was a cheap-o werewolf movie. The werewolves looked like guys in gorilla suits. The special magic laser (?) effects Sybil was doing looked awful. The acting was wooden. The werewolf \"sex\" scene between Sybil and two of her minions was too silly and definitely too hairy. Add it all up: Howling II = Bad Movie. On the plus side, there were Sybil's naked breasts. If you want people to sit through your ending credits, call on Sybil Danning.",
         "Ben a out-of-town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice, but he's approached by Stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to put a end to this evil. This is incredibly awful B-grade stuff and I wondered how it even got released. It makes the original 'Howling' look like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking, as this has to be his worst performance I've seen. There was a lot wrong with this real cheap-ass film, ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forgot Lee), cheesy fashion (those sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, bad use of lighting, the humour... if there was any, trashy 80s music (with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing), werewolf's having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue. I thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny, but I was wrong. The positives were the location and settings of the film looked great, but that's about it... actually I'll add Sybil Danning short stripping scene too. During the end credits the band plays their crap-house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film, which I beckon the question why? An awful piece of mess, however at least it isn't boring. 1/5"
