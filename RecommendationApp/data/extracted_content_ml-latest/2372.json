      "synopsis": "Irwin M. Fletcher (Chevy Chase) is back. Our hero starts out dressed in drag as a waitress at a Greek restaurant. He is there getting a story about a gambling ring that is run out of the restarurant. When he gets back to the office with the story, his boss is happy wiht it,but denies Fletch a vacation he promised him, saying he needs to finish another story first. Of course, Fletch is angry. The phone rings, and it is an attorney from Louisana calling to tell Fletch that his great aunt has died and left him her plantation- \"Belle Isle\" - there. Fletch immediately quits his job and tells his boss to send his stuff to \"his mansion in Louisana.\" He flies down, and the attorney - Amanda Ross (Patricia Kalember) takes him to see the plantation. It is a mess. Fletch says that with a little spackling and Napalm it would make a nice mausoleum. The go in the house and Fletch meets the caretaker, \"Calculus Entrophy\" (Cleavon Little). He worked for Fletch's aunt and wants to continue on with Fletch. The caretaker doesn't seem quite the simpleton that he makes out though. Fletch's attorney takes him back to town to sign papers and make him dinner. She informs him that someone wants to buy his property for $150,000.00. Fletch is immediately suspicious and tells her \"no sale.\" They hit it off and end up spending the night together. While they are both sleeping, someone comes into the house and kills the attorney, and Fletch wakes up in the morning to find her dead in the bed. The police come and they question Fletch about the death. The chief of police decided to arrest Fletch, not for murder, but for \"Pissing him off.\" Fletch is taken to the jail and put in a cell with a transvestite necrophiliac named Ben Dover (Randall \"Tex\" Cobb), who threatens to molest him. Fletch is saved by another attorney - Hamilton \"Ham\" Johnson (Hal Holbrook), who gets the Ben out of jail. Fletch asks the new attorney to take his case, and he does. He gets Fletch released and they leave. Fletch goes back to his house and talks to Calculus. They sit on the porch to relax, but the KKK shows up chanting over a bullhorn. Fletch puts on a couple of white sheets and joins them - telling them his name is Henry Hiemler. He finds out that they are not there on their own, but are on a \"contract job\" - someone hired them to get rid of some \"undesirable carpetbagger\" - presumably Fletch. Calculus runs them off with a shotgun. The next morning, a real estate agent - Becky Ann Culpepper (Julianne Phillips) comes to put another offer on Fletch's property. This time it's up to $250,000.00. Fletch asks her who is offering the money and she tells him that it's confidential. Fletch decides to do some snooping, so he goes back to Amanda Ross's house and goes in as an exterminator. He finds out that there are others involved in the mystery of his aunt's estate - the Rev. Jamie Lee Farnsworth (R. Lee Ermey) and a mysterious corperation by the name of Bluebird. The police catch him there, but he talks his way out of it by telling them he's searching for termites. He leaves and goes back to the plantation and talks to Calculus about the Reverend and finds out that he is a local icon with his television show and \"Bibleland\" amusement park. Fletch decides to check this out. He goes to a live taping of the television show the next day and is called up front by the Reverend to \"confess his sins\" and \"be saved.\" Fletch makes friends with the Reverend and learns that he wants Fletch's property to expand Bibleland. The next day, Fletch goes to talk to Ham and finds out that he has been cleared of the murder charges and that Amanda's death has been ruled \"natural causes.\" The attorney confesses that the reason Fletch has been cleared is because of his \"religious conversion\" on the Reverend's show. Ham also tells Fletch that the good reverend is a scam artist who tricked his mother out of her land and plantation. Fletch goes fishing that afternoon with Calculus and they discuss the possiblity that Amanda's death was natural. The both say that's very improbable, and Fletch decides that he needs to get a look at Amanda's body to know for sure. He asks Calculus to help him get into the morgue. They put Fletch on a gurney under a sheet and take him in. The morgue operator is Ben Dover. He takes Fletch's prize Laker watch. Calculus tells him that Fletch's name is \"Eldridge Cleaver\" (the great civil right's leader) so we know that Calculus isn't as ignorant as he pretends to be. Once they get back into the morgue, Fletch checks for Amanda's body, but it has already been cremated. This convinces Fletch that she was murdered and creamated quickly to cover it up. So, Fletch goes on the hunt for a murderer. After the morgue, Calculus and he go back to Belle Isle and there's a fire. Fletch has to move in with Calculus. Later they go out to eat so they can talk. While at the restaurant they run into some friends. They offer to take Fletch \"Coon Hunting\" and he goes. While running around the Lousiana night, they go across several properties that were recently sold to the mysterious \"Bluebird\" corporation. The properties are barren and have puddles of goo all over them. Fletch steps in one. As he is checking this out, someone shoots at him. He ducks and runs toward the shooter and gets in a struggle with him. Another gunshot scares off the first shooter, and Fletch finds himself alone...but, on the ground is his Laker watch. He goes back to Calculus's house and tells him he was shot at and he goes to check out Calculus's shotgun to see if it's been used recently, but Calculus grabs the gun off the wall before Fletch can touch it and goes outside. We hear a shot and Calculus tells Fletch that he thought he saw something and shot in the air to scare it away. Fletch decides it's time for some outside help...so he calls his boss back in California. He finds out that Becky Culpepper - the real estate agent is the Reverend Farnsworth's daughter, and he sends his tennis shoes to his boss to have the goo analyzed. The next morning he goes to see Becky and asks if the $250,000 offer is still good. It isn't. He confronts her with the information he received about her paternity and she admits that the Reverend is her father, but that she doesn't believe he's a murderer. Fletch decides it's time to go back to Bibleland and check out the Rev. Farnsworth some more. He dresses up and goes onto the show disguised as a \"faith-healer.\" He sneaks backstage and checks out the computers. He finds out how the Reverend knows how to call specific people out of the audience - he has a computerized system and someone who tells him names and specifics in an earpiece during the show. He also finds out that the Rev. Farnsworth has plans that would expand Bibleland to all of the neighboring plantations, not just his. Fletch gets rid of the computer operator and checks the files. He sees that the Reverend wasn't trying to buy the properties, but another mysterious corperation named \"Everest Development\" was. Knowing he needs more information, Fletch decides to start with Ben Dover since he was the one that was shooting at him. He follows Ben from the morgue to a biker bar. Fletch dresses up as \"Ed Harley\", goes into the bar and claims to be the owner of Harley Davidson Motorcycles. Ben doesn't recognize him, and offers to let him go on a ride with his gang. Fletch does - with Becky on the back of his motorcycle. During the ride, Fletch's disguise comes off and Ben recognizes him. They give chase, but Becky and he get away. They go back to her house to clean up. While there, Fletch calls his boss in California and finds out that Bluebird is a corperation that finds dump sites for toxic waste. There is only one near Louisana and it's in Mississippi. Fletch goes to check it out. In Mississippi, Fletch poses as the CEO of Everest Development and talks to the Bluebird factory foreman (Phil Hartman). He finds out that Belle Isle is scheduled to receive a large shipment of the toxic waste in a few weeks. He also finds out from the paperwork there who the \"owner\" of Everest is. Fletch goes back to Louisana and goes to a party thrown by Hamilton Johnson. He tells him that he wants to talk to him privately. When they get upstairs, Fletch tells him that he knows that he is the one who tried to buy his land, killed Amanda, framed him, and has planned a shipment of toxic waste for Belle Isle. Ham then admits to everything - saying he hates Jimmy Lee Farnsworth for what he did to Ham's beloved \"mamma.\" He says he wanted to turn everything around Bibleland into a toxic waste dump to ruin the reverend. Ham pulls a gun and tells Fletch that he's going to kill him. Fletch tells Ham that he left all of the incriminating evidence with Becky and if he doesn't let Fletch go, she'll send it to the FBI. Ham tells Fletch that he's bluffing - and out walks Ben, who has kidnapped Becky. Ham has ordered both of them to be murdered. Fletch is stuck...until he gets an idea. He picks up a picture of Ham's mom and begins insulting her...and this infuriates Ham. Then Fletch grabs Ham's mother's ashes and begins playing with them. He tosses them across the room at Ham, and this causes Ben and Ham to fall, this allows Fletch and Becky to escape. They run to Bibleland and into a live taping of the Reverend's show. Ham comes in with his gun and tries to shoot Fletch, but the Reverend gets in between them and tells Ham he'll have to shoot him first. Just then, shots ring out and Ham goes down...the FBI is there and have killed Ham...the FBI agent in charge is Calculus...whose real name is Agent Goldstein. They have had the ministry under investigation for months. They all go outside and talk about things a bit...Fletch tells Calculus that he knew he wasn't a backwoods simpleton all along. The Reverend says he's going to rerun the show with the shooting incident everyday for Sweeps month. Fletch kisses Becky and mentions the possibility of her coming back to California with him. When Fletch gets back to California and his job at the newspaper, there's a big party for him and his boss has given him a raise and a corner office. Fletch also receives an insurance check for $100,000 for the fire and the toxic waste dumping at Belle Isle. Just then, Fletch's ex-wife's attorney shows up and says that Fletch's ex-wife wants the property in Louisana as part of the alimony. He tells Fletch if he'll sign over the property, that they'll leave him alone for the rest of his life and he'll never have to pay anything to her again. So, Fletch gladly does...pretending all the time it's killing him to do it...and never telling the attorney that they plantation is now a burned-down toxic waste dump...",

         "What a sad world it is when people can sit back and gripe about \"Fletch Lives\". Tsk, tsk, tsk! First of all, how can anyone pick up a video with this sort of picture of Chevy Chase on the front and expect it to not be stupid--in the best possible sense! Indeed, I admit, the movie is stupid, but that is wholly what I love about it. Sure, if you want a more realistic mystery story, watch the first one. But for purely enjoying Chevy Chase's ridiculous antics, this one surpasses it. Though I can't imagine any other actor who could have pulled this script off and made it anything worthwhile! I generally end up watching this movie at least every few months and have yet to grow tired of it. And yet I have only recently added the first movie to my private collection. Chevy Chase is one of the best out-and-out comedy actors available in my opinion. And you can't expect him to be serious in a movie that was intended to be anything but. I think the best part about Chevy Chase as Fletch, is that he lives out those crazy ideas we sometimes get (such as convincing someone of invisible squealing bugs, simply telling someone their house is on fire, and marching into a corporation like you own the place), and he gets away with it when most of us don't dare in the first place. Perhaps the people who can't enjoy him simply don't get the same temptations, and therefore can't see why he appeals to those of us who have to repress the desire to introduce yourself as a famous sixteenth-century astrologer.",
         "You had to a fan of Chevy Chase to fully enjoy the first installment but here you have to be a die hard devotee to get the most out of the sequel. The first one had a really good detective story that nearly got buried with wisecracks, but on subsequent viewings it really came alive and it ranks as one of the best movies Chevy Chase has been involved in. Fletch Lives has Fletch moving to the South where he has inherited a mansion from his aunt. Continuing interest in buying the nearly worthless land for a huge amount of money evokes suspicions and our favorite reporter goes snooping around. Fletch Lives is not nearly as well crafted or written as the first one, with a rather predictable mystery that doesn't seem to take itself seriously for one second. But it does have some fantastic comic sequences; such as Fletch impersonating a faith healer, Fletch encountering a mean biker gang, a memorable meeting with a fellow inmate and some one great one-liners delivered with style by the great comedian (as you might have guessed; I'm a big fan). Supporting actors like Hal Holbrook and R. Lee Ermey add to the enjoyment and Chase delivers but when all is said and done Fletch Lives is for fans only who can overlook the shallowness of the film as a whole.",
         "When Gregory McDonald created the character I. M. Fletcher \"Fletch\", he must have had Chevy Chase in mind. Both \"Fletch Lives\" and \"Fletch\" are perfect vehicles for Chevy's brand of dry humor. Snappy dialogue and amusing disguises by Chase make these two Fletch movies, his best film work. If you like Chevy Chase you'll love \"Fletch Lives and \"Fletch\".",
         "Another classic Chevy Chase film. This film is only just better than the previous movie. There are plenty of wise-cracks and smart remarks to keep you laughing. A must see for Chevy Chase fans and comedy fans in general. This film is very similar to the original. Irwin Fletcher has inherited a mansion from his Aunt who has passed away. Soon enough Fletch finds that his land is worth more than he expected, around lets say $250,000. Remember this is back in 1989 and that was a hell of a lot of money back then! Soon enough Fletch discovers that whoever wants his land, will not hesitate to rid him as well. I don't want to give away too much information, it will be better for you to discover it for yourself. Pros - Entertaining Story, many hilarious jokes, Chevy Chase. Cons - Last Fletch film starring Chevy Chase, not quite a satisfying ending for the two films Overall a must see and a guaranteed laugh. Heres a tip, invite a few mates over your place, order some pizza and you are set for a night of entertainment. Movies don't get much better than this.",
         "Peggy-Lee Zorba, Nostradamus, The Colonel, Victor Hugo, Billy-Jean King, Claude-Henry Smoot, Peter Lemonjello, Ed Harley, Elmer-Fudd Gantry and Bobby-Lee Schwartz II. Not to mention Fletch himself. Has Chevy Chase ever played so many people in one film? I love Fletch Lives, it is so damn funny and cackles with hilarious dialogue. It's a bloody shame that the critics were beastly, when it first came out. Chevy Chase, once again, nails the role of Fletch and only he can deliver the deadpan sarcasm in a way no other actor can. Fletch quits his job as an investigative reporter after he inherits a plantation mansion in Louisiana. But he stumbles upon another mystery and does his best to unravel it. Compared to the first the plot may be a little weak but it works fine. The focus seems to have shifted to Fletch's disguises and working set-pieces and gags around them rather than working on layers of mystery. And why the producers commissioned a brand new screenplay instead working from one of Gregory MacDonald's novels is beyond me. His disguises will, however, make you grin from ear to ear (Claude Henry Smoot steals the show) and they way he comes out with the most ridiculous of things when he's talking to people makes you wonder why they ever believe it. As Peter Lemonjello, Fletch tells a studio camera operator that his house is on fire. The guy believes him! I do wish that they had used more of the Bibleland sets as it seems so much for so little screen time but the presence of R. Lee Ermey as the eccentric TV Evangelist makes up for it. And to any of you who are puzzled why Mr. Underhill is credited in the cast of characters but not actually in the film, he IS. Look closely at the Zipedee Doo-Dah sequence and you can see him as one of the dancers. Had the producers treated Fletch like James Bond we might have a new Fletch mystery every two years since 1985 if they followed the order of MacDonald's books (not chronologically, of course, as they're all over the place). It could have turned into Chase's signature roll. There's been talk of a sequel for years and with various names attached as Chase seems to have been ejected from the role. Though he is the ONLY Fletch in my opinion. At the very least, if a sequel IS made, they cannot dispose of Harold Faltermeyer's brilliant score, which I found to be nothing short of awesome when I was a kid, and little has changed since then.",
         "Irwin Fletcher, or better known as 'Fletch' is a Los Angeles investigative reporter, who quits his job and heads to Belle Isle a vast 80-arce Louisiana plantation that he has inherited from his late aunt. But soon after meeting the lovely attorney and spending the night together, she is mysteriously dead the next morning. This is where the trouble comes along, with a local lawyer telling him to leave town, and a stunning real estate agent has come to make Fletch a healthy offer for his estate. Though Fletch thinks there's something fishy about all of this and he goes to hilarious lengths to figure the real truth about why someone wants his land. It never seems to amaze me, about how much I get out of this flick. Sure, there's nothing truly great about this feature and you can call it pointless and crude, but I never get tired of the shenanigans and Chevy's wittiness. You could say it's a guilty pleasure of mine that will always be a favourite, no matter what anyone else thinks. 'Fletch Lives' is basically more or less a vehicle for Chevy Chase's dry, smart-ass humour, and his prominently cunning persona. Really, that's about it. During this stage he was one of the funniest comedians in his prime. The others stars who appeared, in the likes of Hal Holbrook, R. Lee Ermey, Julianne Phillips and Richard Libertini basically play off Chase's character and fall under the mockery of his heavy-handed humour. But still, amongst their stupidity are fun performances from the support roles. The beautiful woman in the film seem to be there only for showpieces and to always fall under Fletch's charismatic appeal. Meaning they look nice, but really that's about it. I'll even go to say that this sequel truly outdoes the original. By containing far more laughs and gags that actually work than that of the original. I don't mind the original, I like it. If you think this sequel is going to be just like the 'Fletch', forget it. It's far from it actually. While the original film was more a mystery story that led into ingenious gags. The mystery in this one takes a back step, and that's a BIG one too. The thin story and Chase's narration isn't much to go by, so most of the elements (or better put, little episodes) provided in the flick are their to give Chase some ammo to pock fun at, while dressing up in his offbeat disguises. In doing so, it basically comes off as parodying that of some movies (look at the title) and the southern states, especially by ridiculing the KKK and Religious gatherings. Some of these scenarios are embarrassing and have no meaning but to pad out the film. But that being said the action and laughs barely let up, as you just roll on with the sharp humour and punch lines. Honestly, its inane drivel that's for sure, but everyone pulls it off well enough. The comical aspect is basically tongue-in-cheek, with a touch of dry remarks and underlying sexual perversion. For some it might be offensive and lowbrow, but I couldn't help myself from raising a smirk from time to time. Chevy Chase's cool-as-ice performance was great fun, and I just enjoyed his manic absurdity overall and Cleavon Little was delightful as Calculus Entropy the caretaker of Fletch's estate. Nothing will totally gobs-smack you about it, but it's just a sentimental favourite of mine, which I always find something joyous upon each viewing.",
         "Chevy Chase returns as goofy reporter Irwin Fletcher. This time, he inherits a Louisiana mansion and decides to move there. On the way, he expects the mansion (and the South overall) to be a \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" world, but finds just the opposite when he arrives. To complicate matters, he finds himself involved in a murder plot, gets chased by the Ku Klux Klan, and various other mishaps. Oh come on! I shouldn't have to explain \"Fletch Lives\" to you! The very presence of Chevy Chase should identify that it's a hilariously wacky good time (remember, he was funny before his failed attempt at a TV show; and he did play a good role in \"Orange County\"). I don't care what anyone says; Chevy Chase is truly one of the funniest people in history.",
         "Fletch is back and I LOVE his return! As sequels go, this one surpasses the original. This story line is excellent and the plot was a brilliant vehicle for Chevy. I really wish they would do another for him. This time, Fletch is so disgusted with his boss Frank, that when his hermetic Aunt Belle passes away and leaves him her mansion, Belle Isle in Louisiana, he quits his job and moves to the Bayou. But things on the Bayou are anything but serene. Aside from the expected clichéd stereotypical fare generated by the southern locale, this movie was more than enjoyable, and far superior to its predecessor in that the role has expanded and encompasses a far broader spectrum that did the original. While still a comedic venture, it has a more serious undertone than did the first. A far more enjoyable movie, in my opinion, with the same lovable comedic efforts by Chevy. My name...most of the time, is Irwin Fletcher. I write under the name Jane Doe. That's the kinda gal I am. It rates an 8.2/10 from... the Fiend :.",
         "FLETCH LIVES is funnier than the original. Less gritty than FLETCH, the sequel pits the P.I. against a PTL type fraud group which has it's hand in murder and crime. The sequel thrives on satire complete with a elaborate send up of tv evangelism and a song and dance scene which is a spoof on SONG OF THE SOUTH. Irreverent and clever FLETCH LIVES is one of the better vehicles that CHEVY CHASE was in during the 1980's. FLETCH LIVES sports a ensemble supporting cast and was something different instead of the usual hollywood canned sequel.",
         "I don't know why all the negativity against this great and entertaining movie? It's much funnier than the first part or should I say much less boring! My only guess is that the people expect it to be bad like the majority off the sequels are or they raise bar very, very high because they probably loved the original and if you change one thing in the sequel it's suddenly a disaster! To be honest, I first saw this part many, many times before I saw the first, because in my country this part was very popular and many stations were broadcast and re run it. To tell you the truth, at that time and trough the many years I didn't even know that there is a first part! That's because I didn't have a internet and many other reasons.. But, I assure you, if all of them saw this part first, they would love it better then the first! Watch it! You will enjoy it, I guaranty you! ;)"
