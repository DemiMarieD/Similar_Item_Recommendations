         "Fearing the worst, but realizing Mike Figgis had directed it, I decided to take a look at this 1993 picture. Never saw it in its commercial release, as it didn't stay in theaters for a long time. This is a film about a man who is mentally unbalanced. Who could ever know what goes on in the mind of a person with a problem such as the one that afflicts Mr. Jones, the strange character that seems to be on a permanent high, as he is introduced in the first scenes of the movie. Individuals such as Mr. Jones, in real life, go from one state of euphoria to periods of great depression. This is a study about a man that is breaking down in front of our eyes and no one has a clue of what to do with him. Eric Roth, the screen writer, seems to be telling us that hospitals such as where Mr. Jones is taken to, can do more harm than good. Evidently medicine given to these patients could well contribute to aggravate their condition. It's only through the encounter of Jones with the psychiatrist, Dr. Bowen, that he is correctly diagnosed. In treating this man, Libby, ends up falling in love with a person who might never be cured and will live forever in a world of his own, where no one else can enter, or no one can shed any light about what will cure his condition. Richard Gere's portrayal of Mr. Jones was quite a departure from the roles he chooses to play, usually. He makes this man compelling, as we feel sorry for what's going on in his mind. Lena Olin, is also good as the shrink that understands what's in Jones' mind. Delroy Lindo, makes another great appearance as Howard, the man who befriends the mysterious man and tries to help him. Anne Bancroft as the director of the institution doesn't have much to do. The film, although a bit long, is never boring. It will keep any viewer interested in what will happen next, as the people suffering this disease go through all the changes caused by what is going on in their minds.",
         "This was Mike Figgis' first film after the rather wonderful and haunting \"Liebestraum\" and compared to that it's a disappointment. As others have commented, Gere's acting is magnificent. I have a good friend who is manic depressive and Gere nails the condition absolutely. As others have also commented, this performance is straightjacketed into a contrived Hollywood vehicle with a laughably pat romantic ending. I was unsurprised to discover that the film was taken away from Figgis by the studio, redited, rescored and partially reshot. A couple of points: of course Lena Olin's character behaves unprofessionally, that's made quite clear in the movie, so pointing it out as a flaw seems a little wide of the mark. What we in fact have is a slightly more subtle than usual rendition of the \"psychiatrist is as nutty as the patient\" trope - she is shown earlier in the movie to be extremely vulnerable and perhaps irrational after a failed relationship. Meanwhile Gere is extremely charismatic, as manic personalities can be, she is drawn to him out of her own depressed state and the time-honoured Freudian concept of transference does the rest. In addition the choice she makes addresses the notion introduced by Gere's character in the movie - how much is she prepared to give up? There are also serious questions about \"madness\" touched on in the film - where does individual personality end and illness begin? To what extent is insanity a logical response to an intolerable situation? Perhaps these were originally to be explored in a little more depth. I suppose this \"accountant's cut\" didn't do well enough at the box office for there to be much chance of a director's cut and that's a shame. It seems there is a much better film somewhere in here screaming to be let out....",
         "I don't know very much about bipolar depression, aside from reading biographies of Robert Lowell, the poet. I have to say though that Richard Gere is outstanding in this movie. It started showing on ITV2 and his performance drew me into the story- I had to watch it to the end. It's a brave premise for a Hollywood film but \"Mr. Jones\" is let down by a flawed script. I was offended by the way the doctor was portrayed. Of course she was played by a stunning actress, of course she became attached to her patient- to the point of invading his privacy by looking up his friends from his time at music college twenty years earlier. Oh, and of course (SPOILER- in more ways than one) she slept with him as well. She offers to resign which keeps her from being professionally ruined \u0096 sorry, but I can't see a qualified and experienced psychiatrist falling in love with her patient, let along sleeping with him while he's still under treatment. The ending peters out as well- to suggest that they will become a couple, I suppose. The hospital scenes are strong and moving, as is the the subplot about the young student. This could have been an interesting study of people in emotional distress. Too bad they couldn't match Mr. Jones with unsentimental and uncompromising portraits of those trying to help him.",
         "As a sufferer myself, I found this film very reassuring that my actions are not totally alien. It was both entertaining and supportive. Geres' line that he needs the highs to be able to cope with the lows just shows an understanding into the illness. This is well acted, well written and well worth watching.",
         "This is a beautifully written movie of a manic depressive. All the moods and feelings this man experiences is brought to life so expertly by Richard Gere. This is perhaps Richard's best performance. I don't think many actors could have pulled this off and make it seem authentic. How Richard never won an Oscar or was not even nominated for his performance is beyond me. Richard obviously spends a lot of time preparing for a roll, being that he is a perfectionist and it shows in everything he does. I think Richard Gere is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. I have read a lot of the negative comments of his bad choices on the rolls and movies he picks to do (which I don't agree), but on this movie his choice was perfect. If you want to see one of Richard's best performances then this is a MUST SEE.",
         "In this intense and emotional tale of compassion, rescue and love, director Mike Figgis portrays the antithesis of the Richard Gere he had shown us three years before Mr. Jones' release: A needy, fragile, unstable yet creative and fascinating character versus the sinister, cold-blooded and self-confident officer Dennis Peck in Internal Affairs. Gere's ability to absorb the script and bring it to life through his inimitable histrionic demeanor has once again amazed me, bringing me into the scene as if I were observing from behind the camera. Another example of a woman assisting a man throughout his struggle is Figgis' Leavign Las Vegas, where Elizabeth Shue chooses to be by Nicholas Cages' side, with the exception of a very sad ending (In this case we had pills instead of bottles). From Final Analysis, Gear switches into the patient's role, making us hold our breath and, needless to say, get a good use out of our handkerchiefs.",
         "I caught this movie last night on TMC. It premiered soon after I was diagnosed with clinical depression in 93 and even though I was glad to finally have a name to my own madness, I was not ready to see it at that point. Many told me about it though and finally, I saw it. It was very, very good. Gere did an exceptional job at portraying the classic Bipolar I individual. (My depression is 95% lows and have had only one or two manic episodes in my life and am well controlled and on meds). The highs are fun but it is pure payback with the lows. Of course, with this being a movie, The Dr. falls for Mr Jones and in the real world, that would lead to termination on her part. In the case of movies though, anything goes and Richard Gere would be hard not to fall for, LOL. Everyone did an exceptional job and it was an exceptional movie. Kudos to all!",
         "I find it interesting that films are so often chastised for being \"unrealistic,\" when realism is usually neither an attainable nor desirable goal in a film (for example, most films don't portray a story that unfolds within two hours or less, so montages or other devices are used). The main purpose of Mr. Jones (the film) is to tell the story of a man with bipolar disorder, and issues of \"realism,\" for me, are then based on two questions. Firstly, did the film, and Richard Gere in particular, accurately portray the experiences of a person with bipolar disorder? Secondly, was his experience with mental heath care also fairly portrayed? As someone who has suffered from bipolar disorder for almost ten years, I can unequivocally say that the answer to both questions is yes. This film gives the best portrayal I have yet to see of the experiences of suffering from and being treated for bipolar disorder. From the early scene where Mr. Jones is seen trying desperately to get a job, to the ending sequence where he tries to fly for the nth time over and gives up, Gere gives an outstanding and thoroughly believable performance of a man living with the intensity of bipolar disorder. Most poignant to me were the moments when he was able to realize just how much he was fooling himself about the disease, yet couldn't break away from it. In a lesser movie, the line \"I'm an addict\" would be a sarcastic reference to his medication; here, it is used as a perfect description of Jones' need for his manic highs. In addition, I have yet to see as understanding a cinematic portrayal of mental health care in the United States. Even upon viewing it fifteen years later, this film deals so accurately with so many mental health care issues - the \"revolving door\" aspect of treating patients in current-day America, the moments of joy and pain one can experience even within a hospital (without the overdone dramatics of most films taking place in mental hospitals), and the efforts and sacrifices that doctors and staff make every day. Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of the film has to be the ease with which Gere walks in and out of treatment, a truly realistic situation, even more realistic because he has apparently been doing so for many years. The reality, despite what films would normally have us believe, is that it is much more likely in America today to be trapped in a \"revolving door\" for many years, never getting the treatment one really needs, than to be \"wrongfully institutionalized\" for many years. Unfortunately for \"realism,\" the latter makes for much better high drama. Speaking of high drama, let me turn to two slightly controversial aspects of the film: the love story aspect, and the ending. Personally, I don't find it \"unrealistic\" that Jones' doctor could fall in love with him - it certainly happens in real-life patient-doctor relationships, and it makes for an interesting twist. Others have criticized this part of the story as unnecessary, but I see no particular reason for its omission, because the film did give plenty of screen time to the story of Jones' disease and there was room for this extra plot angle. In addition, her responses to the developing relationship and her resignation were handled excellently and accurately - there was no deux ex machina that allowed her to stay at the hospital or keep treating him - and also allowed for a look at some of the ethical issues involved in mental heath care. My only issue with the love story was that it was a bit clichéd, but it didn't detract from the film much at all in my opinion. As for the ending, a lot of people have had trouble with the fact that Jones either seems to be \"cured\" too easily, or that there was no climax where he actually fell off the house, or that in general it was too \"neatly wrapped up.\" I would have to say that, knowing the bipolar disorder condition so personally, the ending was perfect. For sufferers of bipolar disorder, it can be so easy and quick to move from one mood to another, and the arrival of a loved one can easily \"snap you out\" of dangerous situations. The message that I took from the ending was not that he was \"cured,\" or that he wasn't (there is no \"cure\" for bipolar disorder at this point). It was simply that he had faced another tough day as a sufferer of a disease, and that he now had a lover who was going to help him face more tough days. The end dialogue is particularly telling. His last line: \"So now what?\" Hers: \"A cup of coffee. Decaf.\" They are moving on. Our view into their lives is over, but they will be fighting the battle for years to come. The rest of the movie has already told us that. A lesser script would have had some sort of \"and then life became great\" montage, which would have ruined this film. Here we are left with the understanding that the fight against the disease goes on, but that he now has someone who will aid in the fight and temper his moods as best she can, starting with sticking to decaf (which is more than just a joke if you have bipolar disorder). If you don't mind a fairly standard Hollywood love story as part of the mix, you will find this an outstanding, moving, and educational film. I give it 9 out of 10 only because the love story goes on just a tad too long, and that time could have been used for more exploration of the illness and its treatment.",
         "Based on the first few minutes, I was expecting a comedy about a happy-go-lucky construction worker who displays unconventional behavior. Even after his first trip to a mental hospital, I figured this would be a romantic comedy about a fun guy and the pretty female psychiatrist who wants to prove he's wacko. Actually, she is right about him. He is manic-depressive. The man who only refers to himself as \"Mr. Jones\" doesn't believe he is manic-depressive because he would have to get depressed. We haven't seen it and surely it's not true, right? Wrong. This is a very troubled man. He will need a lot of care, and we must be prepared to go through some hard times with him. Richard Gere did a very good job. Naturally, I liked him best when he was fun. His character seems \"normal\" because this is a movie, but that soon changes. Gere effectively shows a wide range of personality styles, though this is nothing groundbreaking. Delroy Lindo is a standout performer as Howard, the co-worker who apparently saves Mr. Jones' life. Although they work together less than a full day (I assume), they become close friends. Some of my favorite scenes have Gere and Lindo together. Baha Jackson does a good job as Howard's son. Lauren Tom briefly appears as a bubbly, fast-talking, excited patient. Too bubbly. She's going to have to crash--and she does. Whether you like this movie or not depends on whether you want comedy or drama. I found enough scenes enjoyable.",
         "Mr. Jones: \"Give me this. This first day, I work for free. I give it to you, its a gift. Second day, you pay me for two days. Third day, I have your job.\" A little gem of a movie. Yes it's subject matter (Bi-polarism and mental illness, and what not) are a tragic and sad theme. But that is why we watch and we learn sometimes from movies. Richard Gere shines as Mr.Jones. he reminds me of the character 'Jesse Lujack' he played in his movie Breathless(1983). Same hyped up energy.He still looks sexy enough for you as the viewer to believe that a woman doctor or woman bank cashier would risk their jobs and sanity for him. Lena Olin is good also as the doctor treating Gere and falls for his crazy charms. Anne Bancroft did an OK turn as Lena's fellow doctor and superior ,Dr. Catherine Holland . Delroy Lindo had a wonderful turn as Howard, the family man who wants to help Jones by giving him friendship. Lauren Tom does a credible job as the ill-fated and mentally unstable patient Amanda Chang. Ana Maria Horsford( from'Friday' fame) has a basically nice cameo as a judge. Thomas Mikal Ford (Tommy from Martin fame) also has a nice bit as a mentally ill patient who can be violent. And last but not least, comic character actor Taylor Negron(Easy Money's Julio)has a nice bit also as a helpless victim of Jones, when said Jones just steals his motorcycle! Actors that got 'wasted' for me were great character actors Sal Lopez(American me) and Bill Moseley(The Devil's Rejects) and Valente Rodriguez(The George Lopez Show) and last but not least,Lucinda Jenny(Rain Man). What I mean by wasted is that their roles were so minimal and inconsequential that I did not see them though they are listed in the credits. What a shame,good talent put to waste. But on a different note and a nice uncredited cameo bit was done by none other than , Bill Pullman as the Construction Site Foreman who is another victim of Jones who falls for his 'charm' and gives a him job(not a good idea). All in all, one of my favorites. Check it out!"
