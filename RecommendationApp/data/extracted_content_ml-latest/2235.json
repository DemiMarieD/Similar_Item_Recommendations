         "Someday, perhaps, when this film achieves the reputation as a classic that it deserves it will be widely re-released. A labor of love for Berenger, it features the acclaimed actor in possibly his greatest performance as an Irish sergeant who fights with his men on the side of the Mexicans during the Mexican war. Tom is incredible here, especially in the closing scenes, but everything is superb here, the music, photography, direction by Lance Hool, supporting performances, everything you could ask for in a spectacle like this.See this film.",
         "This is one of the most powerfully moving films I've ever seen. Maybe it does lack some technical expertise, but I got so totally lost in the storyline, I didn't notice that. This film is precisely what I appreciate so much about Tom Berenger: it seems that Tom Berenger can take a small episode of history and make it memorable--so memorable, in fact, that I've seen this movie only twice, but scenes from it keep playing in my mind.",
         "Anyone who doubts the power of religion to sway a man's loyalties has never studied history. Likewise, anyone who doubts the power of a man's need to feel respect and a sense of \"belonging\" has simply never felt the lack. The Irish of the time came to our shores fleeing famine and disease, poor in the wallet but rich in pride and heritage. They asked for nothing but a chance, and took what was offered in good faith. The politics of the time made them much as the Mexicans are viewed today. Unwanted aliens who should be sent back from whence they came. Taking the offer of the US Army at face value, they were ridiculed and scorned and abused constantly. When battle was joined they found themselves fighting a people not so different from themselves. A people who shared ties of Catholicism, as well as spirit. They got nothing but hatred and ridicule from those who supposedly would welcome them, and could not be proud of fighting Mexicans, who shared so much in common with them. All they asked was a place to belong. Once they found it, they fought for it with all they had. It just happened, they found it in the ones they were supposed to be fighting.",
         "I was surprised by this movie. Not only is it incredibly interesting, but it has fine production values, good acting, and is alternately stirring and touching, yet ultimately tragic. Apparently the film received little or no press and release because of it's subject matter: The San Patricios or St. Patrick's Brigade for the Mexican Army who deserted the American Army because they were being discriminated against during the Mexican American War. It's a captivating story which I'm surprised I'd never heard before, though I don't understand why some people took so poorly to it, it's just history. All in all the filmmakers and cast did a fine job presenting this story very nicely. Recommended.",
         "I learned about the San Patricio Battalion in college and even did a senior paper on the unit. Consequentially, when I heard about their story coming to the big screen I looked forward to it. The story, though interesting, is not without its flaws. Set at the eve of the US-Mexican War (sometime in late April 1846 given that war hasn't broken out yet), the movie spans the duration of the war and initially attempts to give a nod to our country's unhappy heritage of ethnic bigotry against, in this case, the Irish and other then-recent European immigrants. This bigotry drives a few of these immigrants from the US Army into the service of Mexico, in time for the war between both countries. In the movie Tom Berringer's character of John Riley is the leader of a small group of these deserters although, historically, John Riley was already in the command structure of Mexico's San Patricios some good time prior to the battle of Monterrey which is shown in the film. The unfortunate fact of the war for Mexico, other than it lost half its territory at war's end, was that her generals were incapable of winning a battle against the Americans. The movie certainly illustrates that point but, surprisingly the major Battle of Buena Vista is given only the slightest nod. I say \"surprisingly\" because during the course of the battle one single Mexican artillery unit created so much havoc on the American lines: the San Patricios! So many experienced artillerymen had joined the unit that its skill was considerable; formidable enough to warrant Zachary Taylor to single out the San Patricio Battalion's position on the battlefield and explicitly order his cavalry to \"Take those Damn Guns!!\" (which they never did). The movie's weakest point, I believe, is sacrificing the story of the unit and its men for the sake of telling a love story between Berringer's Riley character and the Marta character. More sympathy for the Patricio characters could've been generated by concentrating on the relationships between the small unit's men ala \"Saving Private Ryan\", than diverting the story into Riley's quest to find Marta prior to the final battle of Churubusco. Modern Americans' response to the notion of the San Patricios is that they were unjustified traitors who deserved hanging. The movie also could've better spent more of its time justifying the Patricio's cause rather than alluding to it being merely the result of the prohibition of attending Catholic Mass. Lastly, the overdubbed voice at the end of the movie seemed so ham-handed that the epilogue it provides could've been better served by an on screen written epilogue. Overall, the film is an OK though historically inaccurate retelling of the San Patricios' story. Granted historical film viewing should not be looked at as the equal of reading a history book, but the unfortunate fact is that many film goers tend to see both as equals. To be sure the battle of Monterrey is my pick for \"highlight of the film\". But if one wishes to be better acquainted with the San Patricios, one is better off reading a good book.",
         "I feel a great need to comment on this film. One Man's Hero is a beautifully written film. The actors did a superb job in this film, which we also feel was incredibly directed. Why has it taken so long for Hollywood to do a film on the subject of this war? I was lucky enough to see this film while on vacation. Who knows how long I would have to wait to see One Man's Hero if I were to wait for it to be shown in Kentucky? Can MGM not see the error of their ways by not giving One Man's Hero the larger release it deserves and needs to succeed? I am the mother of a school aged child. One Man's Hero, in my opinion, could and would be the topic of MANY history class discussions. Please wake up MGM--the vast majority of people I have spoken to are waiting for a larger release. You need to give the people farther East the opportunity to see this beautiful film--you will NOT regret it. Thank you! Sincerely, Lisa Murley",
         "The struggle by many to get MGM to release this epic movie was worth every effort as you watch this beautiful movie on the big screen. This is one of the performances of Tom Berenger's life.There is no denying the magnitude to which he portrays John Riley's great strength and character. His scenes, quite literally, draw you in like no other role he's played since Sergeant Barnes in Platoon. You'll gasp out loud when witnessing the consequences the San Patricios and John Riley face for desertion. Berenger brings to this movie his heart and soul (along with an excellent Irish brogue)and it shows in the first frame to the last. Artistically shot under Director, Lance Hool, and enhanced by the beautiful score from composer Ernest Troost, this is a film that will stay with you long after you leave the theater. Tom is supported by an equally impressive and strong cast. Daniela Romo, as the fiercely independent and beautiful Marta, is captivating in every scene she is in. Mark Moses, as American Col. Benton Lacy, is a stand-out as John Riley's friend and one of the few fair-minded soldiers in John Riley's former American unit. Character actor James Gammon, who played coach Lou Brown in Major League and Major League II, brought to the movie his homey, down-to-earth talent as the likable Zachary Taylor. This movie tells a little known chapter in American and Mexican history--a chapter that deserves to be told. Tell everyone you know to go out and support this film to ensure a wider release throughout the United States. THIS IS A MOVIE WORTH FIGHTING FOR.",
         "\"One Man's Hero\" is a beautiful film. Beneath any flaws in style and editing, discussions of touchy subject matter, etc. etc., it presents the incredible true story of a group of Irish immigrants who deserted the US army to fight with Mexico during the Mexican War to become the San Patricios. For an $18 million film and fairly unknown director, it stands the test well and emerges an educational and compelling piece of moviemaking. Truth be told, there's nothing spectacular about the battle scenes or any groundbreaking aspects, but the collective strength of the cast and the solid script pay homage to these men. The film boasts several brilliant \"moments\", a sub-plot romance, wonderful performances from supporting cast, a thought provoking subject from the archives of history, and the drama and charismatic profundity of a lost cause and ultimate tragedy. Kudos to great score and utilizing the terrain to the benefit of the film. Though it's not a blazing Oscar candidate, this is a wonderful, sad, and highly personal film about human beings trying to make the best of an unusual and dangerous situation. It has a layered cultural atmosphere that is refreshing and enlightening, and no doubt you'll end the film with a new appreciation of history and belief in good film.",
         "One Man's Hero details a little known chapter of the very unpopular Mexican American War. The acting is superb, Tom Berenger aches with conflicted loyalty to his church, to his \"boys\" and to his adopted country. In many ways this is a diffucult film to view. Often, Americans feel my country right or wrong. This film fairly reveals both sides with warts and all. There is never a winner in any military confrontation. Everyone loses - their own lives, the life of a loved one, a cherised home land. The US army of the 1800's often employed less than honorable tactics to lure uneducated immigrants into its rank & file. What they found was a prejudice not just reserved for the those of a different color skin or on the \"other\" side of the confrontation. The prejudices of the army were cruelly devisive & a socially acceptable behavior among the rank and file of the US troops. Often an ethnic groups loyalties were not grounded in the flag and mission of their adopted homeland, but among their own, where they shared traditions, culture and church. This is the story of One Man's Hero. The cast is excellent. The story will make you think. Today we talk about human rights, human dignity .... In the 1800's our country was far from the equality, freedom and dignity we are still striving to achieve today. One Man's Hero will make you think. It will make you think twice before you utter an unkindness or that \"funny\" joke from the water cooler. When we hurt others, we are only hurting ourselves. This is the lesson of One Man's Hero. Can we ask any more of a film.",
         "I had the extreme fortune of seeing \"One Man's Hero\" at a test screening in Los Angeles, and frankly, it blew me away. Once in every long while Hollywood lives up to its responsibility to portray subject matters of substance and import to society and humankind at large. \"One Man's Hero\" is one such example. The US-Mexican War is the pivotal chapter in the history of North America. It is the war that sealed the fates of it's two participants. For the United States, the War garnered huge amounts of territory and wealth, bootstrapping the fledgling democracy onto the world stage. For Mexico, the War sent the emerging nation into a tailspin that it is still reckoning with today, one hundred fifty years later. In the United States the US-Mexican War is virtually forgotten, and for good reason, as it is the clearest example of our historical hypocrisy. The US-Mexican War was waged upon Mexico out of pure greed and moral righteousness. The remarkable part of the story is that at the time of this unjust invasion of our peaceful Catholic neighbor, Irish immigrants fresh off the coffin-ships from the Famine identified with Mexico's plight. Over a hundred years before the conscientious objectors of Vietnam, the 'San Patricios' were true heroes who fought and died for their religion, their convictions, their brethren, and their adopted homeland Mexico. While Henry David Thoreau invented civil disobedience in Massachusetts, refusing to pay his taxes to support this unjust invasion of Catholic Mexico, and while Abraham Lincoln stood in opposition to President Polk's scheme in Congress, the 'San Patricios' fought to the death in the front lines against the invading Yankees. Through the eyes of these Irish immigrants, we come to see the underbelly of North American history, and come to understand how we have arrived to such debates as anti-bilingual education in California, our collective guilt manifest in NAFTA, and anti-immigration xenophobia. Rarely does one film illicit such critically profound self reflection, and \"One Man's Hero\" makes us consider who we are and how we have arrived at the United States' Empire here at the turn of the millennium. The acting is superb, melding a stellar cast of as-of-yet unknown talent with Tom Berenger's best performance to date. The script is Shakespearean in it's tact and art. The direction demonstrates an unparalleled intimacy with the subject matter which leaves us gasping for air one moment and reaching for kleenex the next. This is a film in the grand tradition of Hollywood, a huge epic wrought large on the silver screen in the tradition of \"Braveheart\" \"Dr. Zhivago\" and \"Dances with Wolves.\" Domingo Espada, San Francisco, Norte America"
