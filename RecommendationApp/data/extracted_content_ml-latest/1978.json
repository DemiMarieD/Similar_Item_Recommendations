      "synopsis": "A young Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) stumbles upon a graveyard on a rainy night. Two graverobbers, named Neil (Todd Bryant) and Les (Curtis Conaway), are digging up the corpse of Jason Voorhees. Jason rises from the grave and Tommy witnesses Jason murder Neil and Les, and then Jason advances towards Tommy. The graveyard sequence turns out to be a dream and an older Tommy (John Shepherd) awakens from the dream in the back of a van. Tommy has been shifted from various mental institutions after killing the mass murderer Jason Voorhees four years earlier, who attacked him and Tommy's sister Trish and murdered his mother. Tommy still hallucinates the hockey-mask wearing killer and it is unclear what happened to Trish. Tommy arrives at a secluded halfway house for troubled teens in the woods of southern California, called Pinehurst Halfway House. The house is owned by Dr. Matt Letter (Richard Young) and Tommy is shown to his room by supervisor Pam Roberts (Melanie Kinnaman). There, he meets a young boy Reggie (Shavar Ross) living at the house whose grandfather George (Vernon Washington) works as the camp cook. The other teens at the halfway house include nymphomaniac lovers Tina and Eddie (Debi Sue Voorhees) and (John Robert Dixon), redhead Robin (Juliette Cummins), firey-tempered Goth chick Violet (Tiffany Helm), and the shy and stuttering Jake (Jerry Pavlon). Meanwhile, a teenager at the halfway house, the troubled and overweight Joey (Dominick Brascia), is killed with an axe by another teenager at the house, the hot-headed Vic (Mark Venturini). After Vic is arrested, paramedics arrive to take Joey's disembered body away. One paramedic, named Duke (Caskey Swaim), jokes, but another medic, Roy Burns (Dick Wieand), is obviously saddened by the death. While the police and forensic people continue to comb the scene and question the witnesses, two redneck hicks that live near the halfway house, Ethel Hubbard (Carol Locatell) and her retarded son Junior (Ron Sloan) threaten Dr. Matt Letter to shut the place down if the teens don't quit sneaking onto their property. That night, two punks Vinnie (Anthony Barrile) and Pete (Corey Parker) are murdered by someone unseen after their car stalls, Vinnie has a lit road flare shoved in his mouth and Pete has his throat slit. The following night, a local named Billy (Bob DeSimone) is waiting for his girlfriend Lana (Rebecca Wood) to finish her shift at a diner and is killed with an axe to the head. Lana comes outside only to be killed with an axe to the stomach by the same unseen killer. The next day, Tina and Eddie go off into the woods to have sex. Ethel's farmhand Raymond (Sonny Shields) is killed while spying on Tina and Eddie. After sex, Eddie retreats to wash off in the creek and Tina is murdered when a pair of hedge shears plunge into her eyes. Eddie returns and finds her dead, only to have his head crushed against a tree by a leather strap. That evening, Pam, Tommy and Reggie go to a nearby trailer park to see Reggie's older brother Demon (Miguel A. Núñez, Jr.) and his girlfriend Anita (Jere Fields). Tommy wonders off and gets in a fight with Junior and runs off, forcing Pam and Reggie to leave. Pam leaves Reggie at the halfway house and then goes to search for Tommy. Demon and Anita are murdered, Anita has her throat slit and Demon is stabbed with a spear while inside an outhouse. At the Hubbard farm, Junior races back to the Hubbard House, crying to Ethel about what Tommy did but the unseen killer murders him by decapitating him with a cleaver as he rides on his motorcycle. The unseen killer then murders Ethel with the same meat cleaver to her head who then falls, face first, into a pot of boiling stew. Back at the halfway house, Reggie falls asleep on the living room couch as it starts to rain outside. The unseen killer quietly enters the house and quickly murders Jake with a meat cleaver, impales Robin from underneath the bed with a machete, and then enters Violet's bedroom and murders her as well. Reggie awakens and finds the dead bodies in Tommy's room. Pam arrives and also sees the bodies. They try to flee, but encounter the killer, who appears to be Jason risen from the dead (who finally reveals himself by making a spectacular brava appearance by bursting into the house through the back door). Pam and Reggie flee the halfway house and are separated in the woods. Pam finds Duke's body with his throat slit in his ambulance, and Matt's body nailed to a tree with a spike in his forehead. Pam also finds George dead with his eyes gouged out. The chase finally leads to the barn where Reggie rams Jason with a bulldozer. But Jason rises and attacks them inside the barn. Pam fends Jason off with a chainsaw and retreats to the upper loft with Reggie. Tommy appears, and is stabbed by Jason. Still alive, Tommy stabs Jason in the leg with a switchblade and climbs up to the loft as well, but passes out, severely wounded. The wounded Jason climbs into the loft and, after ignoring Tommy's unconcious body, finds Pam and Reggie, but Reggie manages to knock Jason off the hayloft. As they embrace, Jason pops back up and tries to drag Reggie off the loft, but Tommy musters enough strength to seize the machete and hack Jason in the hand. His mask falls off & sends him falling down onto sharp farm equipment. The mask and prosthetic face are removed to reveal Roy Burns, the paramedic, as the killer. In the hospital, the local sheriff explains to Pam that Joey, the boy who was killed with the axe was Roy's son and it drove him to go mad, dress up as Jason and go on a killing spree. Pam goes to check on Tommy, who is asleep, but suddenly, Tommy pops up and stabs Pam with a boning knife. It turns out to be Tommy's dream and Pam comes in, only to see the window broken and Tommy stands behind her wielding a knife and wearing a hockey mask.....",

         "I love this film, and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best of this series. Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning is vastly underrated by all the crybabies out there. \"Oh, boohoo, where's Jason?!\" He's not here, so get the hell over it already. I love the halfway house setting. It's a unique idea that naturally lends itself to some offbeat slasher fodder, and I think it works well. I also think the area the film was shot in is the most atmospheric of the series. It helps to make this film the creepiest of all the F13 films, and yes, I firmly do think it's the creepiest. This is probably the most bizarre film in the series too, and I like that. The characters are great. From the quirky halfway house residents to the crazed backwoods hicks, to the wacky Demon, this film's characters are very entertaining, and on many occasions, quite amusing. Especially the hicks. I also love the direction in which they take the character of Tommy Jarvis, having all these mental problems thanks to Mr. Voorhees. His hallucinations are actually rather eerie to boot. It's a damn shame they didn't continue the idea in Jason Lives, which I consider to be one of the weakest entries in the series (but that's another story for another review board). I think the kills in this film are some of the most original in the series, not to mention some of the best. A leather strap crushing someone's head against a tree, a road flare to the mouth, a cleaver decapitation while riding a motorcycle, among others, aren't your typical slasher kills. I also love the fact that the killer is copycat, Roy. It's a nice, refreshing take, and I love Roy every bit as much as I love Jason. I always see people whine about Jason not being the killer here, but I say it's better that way. I think having chocolate bar boy be his son was a nice twist. Funny how he kills everyone but his son's killer, but I'm sure he couldn't get to him with the authorities taking him into custody. That's nice and ironic. I could go on and on about how enjoyable this film is. It has a real charm to it, and it's a shame that so many consider it one of the low points of the series, even the worst. I was disappointed to see this film on the IMDb bottom 100 a good while back, especially considering the horrid Jason Takes Manhattan was nowhere to be found on the list. It's no longer on the list though, so that's cool. And remember, \"Y-ya don't s-set a place for a dead person!\"",
         "This is the best Jason to watch drunk, it's almost like a Friday the 13th blooper reel. I love the singing on the crapper part, the mod chick doing the robot, the \"just wanna earn a meal\" guy, Crazy Ethel and Junior, Billy and Llana, that kid from Diff'rent Strokes, the stupid arse ending, and the excessive nudity. It's a time capsule of sorts, it captures all the bad 80's slasher films in a hour and a half. Bad acting? GOT IT! Ridiculous costumes? GOT IT! Lot's of big haired women topless? GOT IT! No name stars obviously coked out of they're mind? OH THIS MOVIE HAS GOT PLENTY OF THAT! Watch it and laugh, preferably with some friends",
         "Friday the 13th is the best film of the series by far. But then when it comes to a choice of the best sequel, I say that Friday the 13th part 5 is the joint best sequel of the series.Part 4 the so called final chapter is equally as good. I take a look at other peoples comments about this film and it seems to me that I am one of the only people who likes this film. It has everything that the other sequels failed to capture. It had real suspense, as to who the killer was, I mean we all know it was not Jason, he \"was\" dead. It had a lot of different death scenes,and it was all in all a good film. it had the 3 rules for making a successful sequel..... 1)Body count is always bigger 2)The death scenes are more elaborate 3) Never ever ......... oh sorry back to the comments .....Thinking about it, the ending was kind of like a Scooby Doo ending, as to why he did it. The man responsible had a perfectly simple and plain motive, revenge.I`m not going to say what he wanted revenge for or who he was not it was simple. I kind of figured it out that the killer was not Jason, when he gets hurt by many objects you can hear him moan in pain, Jason is a member of the Living Dead Club, which means he is the living dead. And he don`t really feel pain. Tommy Jarvis returns in the film.Corey Feldman is also in it as well, but he has a sort of cameo role. I do not understand why Tommy is in a mental Institute, I mean he is still freaked out by the murder of his mother and friends at the hands of Jason Voorhees. So if you want to find out who killer is and why he did it, then rent out this film or if you`re a horror fan like me, buy it and add it to your horror collection. I give this movie a 8 out of 10.Because of the Crazy \"new beginning\". well it has not really got a new beginning but it is a Pun ........get it???? Do Not worry.",
         "This is another fine sequel in the Friday the 13th franchise. This has a good body count and some gory and graphic scenes. The film takes place some years after Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter and now Tommy is 18 but since he killed Jason he's been traumatised by it all and is sent to a mental hospital just outside of a small town, this one is different since they are free to roam around as they please. Tommy keeps seeing Jason and remembering what happened, soon after the kid gets axed the murders begin by a mysterious man wearing a boiler, hockey mask and carrying a machete. The police believe that it's Jason by the mayor thinks over wise since Jason cremated but of course he isn't, soon more people are being killed off by the killer and after each murder we keep seeing Tommy lying in his bed covered in sweat making us think that he could be the killer since he keeps seeing Jason. The killings soon take place inside the mental hospital and Tommy is nowhere to be seen, Reggie and Pam are the only ones there and find themselves being chased by the killer who could be Tommy or the real Jason or maybe someone else. Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is a great sequel to the franchise. Check it out. 10/10",
         "Years after Tommy Jarvis (John Sheperd) killed Jason Voorhees for good, he has been sent to mental facility to one other home where he is now placed in a halfway house for troubled teens as he tries to get rid of the painful memories of Jason. A fat patient named Joey (Dominick Brasca) who annoys the other patients and one of them named Vic (Mark Venturni) hacks him up then gets arrested. However things may look safe at the haven for Tommy as he befriends a young boy named Reggie (Shevar Ross) who is the grandson of one of the workers. But unfortunately a killer is on the loose in the town but is it really Jason back from the dead or someone in his footsteps? Considered by fans as the worst of the Paramount Friday The 13th movies, this one isn't that bad as they said it was. This movie was originally considered a new beginning after Jason died in the last movie and the makers wanted to make the series into something different with a new killer in each installment which is kind of similar to \"Halloween III: Season of the Witch\" in concept of a different horror movie in each installment. Fans of Jason rejected this idea and wanted the goalie back and they got their wish with the next installment. This part of the series co-stars a cameo by Corey Feldman and even has Miguel Nuenz Jr. of \"Return of the Living Dead\" fame which should surprise fans of the horror genre. There's a lot of graphic killings in this one as it has a body count of 20 dead people with some good kills of skull-crushings, implements, stabbings and that kind of thing. A couple of sexy naked chicks including a topless blonde waitress who is just gorgeous as hell and of course some twists with turns. Overall it's not that bad.",
         "Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning. This sequel is actually one of the best in my opinion, except for the lousy ending. Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning does everything correctly, through the first three quarters of the movie. We start off with the plot of Tommy Jarvis being sent to a halfway house for troubled teens, and there he is plagued by visions of Jason Voorhees. So we now have a fresh twist that the movie isn't to be set about cabins in the woods again, which is a breath of fresh air. Then, we have the absolutely fantastic array of characters, all of which are rememberal and great to watch. Ethel and Junior provide comical relief as the hillbilly mother and son, we feel sympathy for Jake, Violet and Robin, who are all great people to watch interact. The characters are all interesting, and all have their own personal traits which makes them work, instead of them all just wanting to party, drink, smoke and have sex, so this is also a step in a new direction. Out of all of the Friday the 13th instalments, Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning probably has the most memorable characters, and some fantastic scenes with them, for example when Anita and Demon sing whilst he is on the toilet, or when Violet is dancing the robot. Friday the 13th does have some very memorable and inventive death scenes as well, although plot holes and continuity issues do fall through think and fast. There is some nudity as well, mainly from Debbie Sue Voorhees, which is very enjoyable. The script can get very lame, for instance the conversations between Billy and Lana. However the twist ending is that Jason Voorhees wasn't behind these murders, but it was instead a copycat who was killing off the teens after his estranged son was hacked up at that very same halfway house. This is quite a let down, but seriously, don't let this put you completely off. Jason takes a vacation, but this filler still delivers the goods.",
         "The status of Friday The 13th Part V: A New Beginning as the least popular film in the series has always frustrated and perplexed me. Masterfully directed by Danny Steinmann, it is a supremely entertaining exploitation slasher film. The most common reasons given seem to be: (a) there's not enough gore (b) the story is stupid/the acting isn't very good (c) Jason isn't in the movie. Of course, none of these explanations is valid. First of all, if gore alone is your litmus test to determine whether or not a film is enjoyable, you should probably steer clear of the entire Friday The 13th series, as well as any movie that has been subjected to the wacky ratings system and experienced a wide theatrical release. Go watch\u0085 I don't know\u0085 a Guinea Pig film. A New Beginning has as much gore as any of the Friday films. If a strong plot and acting of the highest caliber is important to you\u0085 well, let's be honest, criticizing A New Beginning for its silly plot is like dismissing Van Gogh because you don't like the color yellow. You're missing the point. Yes, I sort of understand the complaint that Jason isn't in the movie, as he is my favorite of the classic maniacs. (Cropsy, Marty, Michael Meyers, and Angela round out the top five.) But his absence alone shouldn't ruin the whole movie for you. I'd rather watch an entertaining movie that alludes to, yet doesn't feature the actual Jason, as opposed to a boring movie that completely screws up his mythology. (Here's a clue. It comes after VIII and before X.) Friday The 13th Part V: A New Beginning works because it takes the elements that make a good slasher film and completely exaggerates them. All irony aside, A New Beginning is a trashy, sleazy, exploitative masterpiece. The very premise of having \"Jason\" hack up a group of mentally-ill teens, which includes two nymphomaniacs, an angry sociopath, a chocolate loving man child, a new-wave goth who likes to dance, and a stutterer, is indicative of the sick-minded, oozy greatness of this movie. Jesus, I haven't even touched upon the mother-son hillbilly biker duo or Demon! This movie has more great characters than the entire Halloween series combined! Are you not entertained by Demon in his \"sh*tbox\" singing \"Oooh, Oooh, Baby\u0085. Oooh, Oooh, Baby\" to his sexy girlfriend before being impaled? How could this be? Are you made of stone? Are you? Do you not enjoy watching Violet, who is the most uniquely attractive female in the entire Friday series, do the robot to Pseudo Echo before being killed? I love her with all my heart. What about Ethel and Junior, the most vile, hate-filled, \"loony\" hating hicks to ever interact with a stained voyeur-drifter? Junior's decapitation, after being pummeled by Tommy following a prank which consisted of shining a light in his eyes, is a fitting end for the angry dullard. Oh, and Vic? The greatest red herring in slasher history. He violently kills Joey after the overweight stereotype accuses him of being \"out of line.\" Harsh words from a strange man! The number of kills in this movie dwarf the previous Friday record. (Subsequent sequels had more, but, with the exception of Jason X\u0085 another unjustly maligned classic\u0085 not by much.) The fact that most of these kills are peripheral to the story, unnecessary, and hilarious only adds to their quality. Case in point, the hideously obnoxious, cocaine-addicted mental health worker Billy who picks up Lana the waitress at the diner. She who proceeds to get naked while saying \"It's showtime!\" to herself in the mirror. You don't see the entertainment value in that, my friends? Following this odd display, a cat bafflingly drops from above and bounces clumsily and hard off a booth. It was a cheap shock and laugh at the same time! Shortly thereafter, Billy and Lana are both killed with enough blood to make it all worthwhile. That entire scene is mesmerizing. And let's not forget the two jerks with the broken down car who appear earlier in the film. They're greasers! Greasers! I watch slasher films not for genuine scares or insightful twists, but to be entertained. And I am usually entertained by their exploitative depths, bloody action, nudity, uniquely stupid characters, and the basest nihilism of it all. I simply cannot see how anyone could argue A New Beginning doesn't contain every single one of these qualities in excess. It's a sleazy, vicious, offensive slasher that epitomizes everything that makes the genre popular. The time has come to re-evaluate this amazing film and give Steinmann the credit he deserves.",
         "This takes place about 10 years after \"The Final (right) Chapter\" (which places it in the mid 1990s!). Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd) is basically mentally disturbed and is being sent to an institution called Pinehurst. As soon as he arrives there people start getting murdered by Jason--but Jason was cremated after he was killed. Is it Tommy finally being driven crazy or is it somebody else? This actually differs from the other sequels--it actually has a story! Also it has an astronomical body count--20! Most of them were cut down by the MPAA to get an R rating however. For those curious--14 men are killed and 6 women. This has all the same problems as earlier movies and then some--there are continuity errors left and right; some truly terrible acting (Melanie Kinnaman as Pam was the worst); bad dialogue; Jason being able to seemingly teleport to magically appear wherever he wants; gratuitous female nudity; two extremely annoying hillbillies and characters so stupid you want them dead! But it has some good points--this is the first Friday the 13th to have black characters; it's never boring; there are very few character scenes (considering how bad they were in the past this is a very good thing) and there is actually some good acting from Shavar Ross, Jerry Pavlon and John Shepherd. The sequence where Shepherd single-handedly knocks the hillbilly cold is a highlight. A lot of fans hate this--it's dismissed as \"the film without Jason\" and considered (along with part 3) as the worst of the series. I disagree. It's no masterpiece by any means but I was always entertained. I give it a 7.",
         "OK lets get it all out that annoys people the most about this movie. Jason Voorhees is not the killer. In the film Tommy Jarvis (from the last film) is sent to a new place to get back to his own self like before the events of the Final Chapter. As he stays he and keeps going into fits of rage and having hallucinations of Jason, as this goes on real murders are happening all over the area by some unknown killer. I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it but honestly behind Part 2 and 4 this is one of my favorite squeals. Many people bash this movie because Jason is not the killer which i think is ridiculous. People honestly don't think, in the original, Pamela Voorhees was the killer not Jason, Originally it was to be an only film, NO Jason, NO nothing. But many people liked it and wanted more. after Jason's death in Final chapter, they wanted to show he was really dead, by bringing in a new killer. I thought that was smart then keep bringing Jason back again. My main point is, Give it a watch! its extremely entertaining, there is a high body count and amazing score. Yes it has its week moments but overall its a lot of fun to watch. Any true Friday the 13th fan must watch!",
         "\"Friday the 13th:A New Beginning\" isn't as bad as those above me keep saying it is.I'm not entirely sure why so many people hate this entry-OK so Jason wasn't there,but there's plenty of violence to satisfy b-horror movie fans and nobody acts any worse than before.Of course this one isn't as good as the previous ones,mainly because it lacks the first four films mean spirited edge,but it is still a pretty enjoyable slasher flick.There's also no real blood or gore as most of the killings appear to take place simply off-camera,but I don't mind that.If I want to be sickened by extreme gore I'll watch again \"Guinea Pig:Flowers of Flesh and Blood\" instead of this,but if I want to see an enjoyable slasher with plenty of nudity I'll choose this one.The plot is simple:the traumatized Tommy Jarvis(John Shepherd),who killed Jason in the previous entry arrives at the Pinehurst home for disturbed teens run by Matt(Richard Young)and Pam(Melanie Kinnaman),soon befriending a good-natured young boy named Reggie(Shavar Ross),whose grandfather works as the institution's cook.Not long after his arrival,Tommy sees an angry patient named Vic(Mark Venturini)hack a fat teen(Dominick Brascia,the same guy who directed forgotten 80's slasher \"Evil Laugh\")to death with an axe.Over twenty more murders follow,but who is the killer? All in all I enjoyed this one,so you should check it out for yourself."
