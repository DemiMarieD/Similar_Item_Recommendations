         "I've seen just about every gay movie out there, and 'edge of seventeen' is by far one of my favorites. The one word that best describes it is 'honest'....but it's also nostalgic, funny, wonderfully simple, yet beautifully complex. The viewer can start off enjoying how accurately it captures the mid 80's, especially the excitement and uncertainty that Eric, the main character, is experiencing. Then, as the story unfolds, each new development that Eric deals with as he comes to terms with being gay is so well done, so honest and nontheatrical, that it feels almost like a documentary. The movie's got a huge heart. Don't miss it!!!",
         "I saw this movie many moons ago, but have not been aware of this medium for commenting on it. I adore this movie, it was my life. Eric's discovery of his sexuality one summer while working at Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio is almost exactly how I discovered mine. I thought as I watched it that someone had stolen my journal, wrote a script about it, and then silently returned it without my knowing. Eric's first love. His making friends at a bar he was not old enough to be in. His developing style, in the way many of us did in the 80's, bad hair and worse clothes, but great music. I could relate to this movie on so many levels. I think that any gay man that found himself in the 80's should watch this film and see where they fit into it. If this movie doesn't remind you of yourself, it is sure to remind you of someone you know. Loved it!",
         "The film is a coming-out story set in Sandusky, Ohio, in 1984. It moves a bit slowly, but it is nevertheless sweet. The characterizations and performances are genuine and provide sincere laughs and tears. The film is amazingly accurate in showing the whole gamut of coming out. The talented cast is wonderful, and the story ultimately is a healing experience.",
         "EDGE OF SEVENTEEN is by far the more realistic and enjoyable \"coming of age/coming out\" films to hit cinemas in a while. On a thematic par with the Brit import GET REAL, this film touches on the reality of coming of age in 1984 mid-America, though I suspect it is pretty much the same in any American suburb. The competition must discount Britain's BEAUTIFUL THING which is really an out and out romance. But it beats the cardboard contrivances of DEFYING GRAVITY, a collegiate scenario of similar ilk. The awkward flirty moments building up to the first boy/boy coupling have an air of sexy familiarity. Film's presumption that \"all some guys want is sex\" is (unfortunately) dead on real. Chris Stafford plays the leading teen with immense charm. We'll see more from Stafford, surely. His studly co-star is suitably entrancing and is fine to look from the back during their love scenes. We certainly understand why our hero falls for this college-age cad. Naturally there's a gal pal, too, who here is underplayed nicely but a little too Winona-like for comfort. Broadway uber-dyke Lea DeLaria is onboard for yuks but is just a little too odd and urban to blend in a Sandusky supermarket. Gay men will get teary as Stafford fesses up to Mom that he's queer. Film's only flaw is some obviously clipped editing. At least two scenes are confusing in continuity leading us to wonder whahappened??? But EDGE OF SEVENTEEN is a winner. Gay or straight, first love and coming of age are themes that hit home.",
         "I saw this movie for the second time last night on cable some 3 or 4 years after my initial viewing. I enjoyed it the first time, but where I am older now and myself am coming out of my shell more (pun intended) as Eric did, I had a greater appreciation of it this time around. I was five years old at the time this movie took place in 1984, and remember some of those tunes from the wonderful and fun soundtrack, but more because I have downloaded them from the internet in recent years. (ssssh) The gay bar in the movie looked like so much fun, especially during that era of glam and new wave. The scenes there strongly resonated with me, especially when Eric first goes there after a high school party where he is called \"queer\" by the guy he was eying and appears somewhat nervous before opening the door and walking inside (I know the feeling), and when Eric instantly made friends there (it helped that he already knew a patron, his boss, Angie (played by the entertaining, if crude, Lea DeLaria), from the fast food joint he worked at with Maggie (Tina Holmes) and Rod (Andersen Gabrych). Also, his gradual evolution into his true self, both literally and figuratively, struck a chord as well. It is difficult to keep up appearances and to suppress who one truly is because of how one is socialized and expected to be. It can be, for some, life-threatening and tragically for others, life-ending. Also, anyone straight or gay can relate to meeting that person (for Eric it was Rod) who knocks your socks (block?) off and who becomes your first love, whether you consummate that mutual attraction or not. Eric is lucky; he got to be with Rod, even if not permanently. The three main characters were very attractive and appealing and acted quite well for an independent feature. Stafford was good in depicting the struggle with one's sexuality that many of us experience and the added pressure of having to conform to what our parents, peers, and society in general expect of us when it isn't exactly what we feel on the inside or want to be. Gabrych was a sexy seducer with a killer smile, and Holmes portrayed a straight girl in love with her gay best friend (Stafford) touchingly. The scene after they consummate their relationship shows Eric clearly disoriented and one could tell by the expression on his face that he knew he was gay and that heterosexual sex wasn't going to do it for him. (Another moment I can relate to.) After all, I really wanted to be in Eric's place in his bed next to that sultry babe.",
         "Anyone who grew up gay in the 70s and came out in the 80s can relate to some aspect of this wonderful film. The music, the clothes, and the look are perfectly recreated. The performances are honest, tender and intimate. The awkward conversations and situations only add to the realism. The complexity of Eric and Maggie's relationship is truthful and very emotional. Eric's internalized homophobia is something most of us go through...especially when we are not ready to \"come out\" to our parents and ourselves. I can recall dressing outrageously and experimenting with my hair to make a statement just as Eric does and then denying that I was gay. Yes, some men are portrayed as \"queenish\" and \"promiscuous\", but that's because some real men are. QUEER AS FOLK should be this good. Chris Stafford shines, Tina Holmes is incredible, Andersen Gabrych is seductive and Stephanie McVay is the mom we all wish we had. The fabulous Lea Delaria belting out \"Blue Skies\" is an added bonus. Looking forward to more greatness from the talents involved here. A great gay companion piece to THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN.",
         "One of the better \"coming of age\" films about gay youth. Especially effective in this movie is Tina Holmes, who plays Maggie, Eric's best friend/girlfriend. She brings a true sense of innocence to the film, and when she discovers the truth about Eric, her pain is real. This is a young woman to watch! The film doesn't flinch in its look at the wonder, confusion, and deception associated with the coming out process, and despite some awkward direction, Edge of Seventeen succeeds at opening the eyes of its audience, both gay and straight.",
         "I honestly did not think I would like this movie. Something about the fact that it was based in the eighties made me a little edgy about seeing it. But I was actually pleasantly surprised. Chris Stafford, who I would very much like to see in bigger roles, presented an incredible portrayal of a young man struggling with his sexuality in a very bias environment. Not only did I enjoy the way his character gradually came out of his shell and embraced this part about him that he had tried so hard to deny for so long but I was just so entranced and surprised by his performance throughout the film. Anderson Gabrych as Rod was equally amazing. I was a little put off by him at first and I was extremely wary of that stereotypical gay he seemed to be at first introduction but I really enjoyed his performance, as well. And Tina Holmes was wonderful as Eric's best friend and her difficulty with the fact that the man she was in love with didn't love her that way was incredibly believable. I enjoyed each actor's portrayal of their character and the flawless acting and the sexy (but tasteful) love scenes and just about everything about the film. The only thing I did not enjoy was the end. It felt awkward and cut short and if the director was aiming for a cliffhanger, he certainly succeeded - but a little too much was left unsaid for a completely successful closing. Overall, the movie was one that I will watch many, many more times. It's an emotional, realistic insight into the struggles of coming out and embracing one's sexuality. Definitely worth the watch.",
         "Liked this film and felt it was a nice try at giving us more of an understanding of the teenaged gay coming out. Lead actor playing Eric, was excellent in portraying all the inner problems that lead to his willingness to admit to himself what he wants for a sexual partner. And who wouldn't with Rod and Jonathan offering their hot little bodies to him for a night of passion. The one thing I feel he missed was the first kiss. It could have been played up more. It sort of came out of the sex thing. But then, a view of Rod's butt soon made that disappear. I liked the mother and her scene with Eric's admission he was gay. She showed not only the pain and confusion, but offered her arms and love to her needing son. Great acting, great scene. The bar scenes bored me, but, then, bars do bore me. I wish more could have been made between Eric and Jonathan. Here I felt there mnight have developed a relationship and Eric might have found some love in his quest for the truth. But, it seems love was not to happen. At least at this stage of his coming out. Too bad. See this movie, if only for the rare look of a teen coming out all by himself.",
         "\"Edge..\" takes on a huge challenge as it takes the audience on an compromised guided tour of homosexuality in bloom while maintaining its entertainment value. The film features some excellent acting by some very unfamiliar faces and strikes an appropriate balance between gay sex and gay love. Kudos."
