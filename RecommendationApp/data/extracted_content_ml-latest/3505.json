         "content": "Counting down the hours for some self investigation.\r\n\r\nNo Way Out is directed by Roger Donaldson and adapted to screenplay by Robert Garland from the novel \"The Big Clock\" written by Kenneth Fearing. It stars Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Sean Young, Will Patton, George Dzundza and Howard Duff. Music is by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by John Alcott.\r\n\r\nAlready filmed impressively as The Big Clock in 1948, Fearing's ingenious source material gets a shift to a Pentagon backdrop and still comes out a winner. Putting their own spin on the central story, that of a man finding he is investigating \"himself\" during a murder enquiry, the makers unfurl a labyrinthine plot that keeps up the suspense quota right to the very end.\r\n\r\nIn true noir style, the story is crammed with double bluffs, deceit, sex and death, with the added ingredient of politico intrigue to spice things still further. Cast are led superbly by Costner and Hackman, though Young is a bit too dull an actress to really put fire into the key femme role, and Alcott makes great use of the real Washington locations to bring visual authenticity to the story's setting.\r\n\r\nJarre's score is hokey sounding and doesn't sit right with the dramatics on show, while the big reveal at the finale is still as divisive today as it was back on the film's release, but this is still a fine example of a film noir remake that really works for the neo-noir loving crowd. 8/10",

      "synopsis": "At a formal ball in Washington D.C., U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner) meets a young woman, Susan Atwell (Sean Young). The two immediately begin an affair when they have quick sex in the backseat of Farrell's limosine and later at Susan's apartment. Although Farrell is clearly in love, it is implied that Susan is involved with someone else. During his next Naval deployment to the Phillippines, Farrell rescues a sailor from his ship during a storm and becomes a hero. He is brought back to Washington to work at the Pentagon in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Secretary of Defense David Brice (Gene Hackman) is aware that his General Counsel Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) is an old friend of Farrell's. Brice is attempting to cancel a white elephant \"Phantom Sub\" project that has powerful political backing. Brice decides that Farrell should act as his direct liaison to the CIA. The real purpose is to gather information about whether the Soviets really are working on such a project. Soon after, Farrell finds out that the other man in Susan's life is Secretary Brice. However, Brice in turn learns of Susan's infidelity. While demanding the name of her new lover, he slaps Susan in a jealous rage and fatally knocks her off an indoor balcony. Ready to turn himself in, Brice is persuaded by Pritchard to cover up everything and blame it on someone else. They concoct a story that claims Susan's other lover was in fact a KGB sleeper agent code-named \"Yuri.\" In the aftermath, they focus all attention on an attempt to capture him. Confident that \"Yuri\" doesn't exist, Director of Central Intelligence Marshall (Fred Dalton Thompson) dismisses the possibility of it being Pritchard having an affair with Susan, saying that Pritchard is homosexual. Brice appoints the unknowing Farrell to lead the investigation to find Susan's other lover; the KGB spy. Farrell is thus placed in the position of attempting to find evidence that could falsely implicate himself. The only forensic evidence in the case is a badly damaged Polaroid negative recovered from Susan's house, which requires lengthy computerized processing to become visible. Aware that it is his face on the blurred photo, Farrell pleads with systems analyst Sam Hesselman, an old friend, to slow down the processing and confides in him about his secret affair with Susan Atwell. While the processing takes place, Farrell sets about re-directing attention back onto Brice. He does this by searching government printouts for evidence that Brice gave Susan a present which was a government-registered gift from Morocco. Pritchard harasses Nina Beka, a close friend of Susan's, by threatening deportation back to South Africa. Then he sends covert assassins to \"take care of\" her. Farrell comes to Nina's rescue just in time. A suspicious Sam goes to Pritchard with concerns about what Farrell told him. Realizing that Sam can implicate Brice, Pritchard shoots him in cold blood. A race develops between two pieces of evidence: the processing of the picture implicating Farrell and a printout of the gift's registration implicating Secretary Brice. Farrell obtains the printout first and confronts Brice with the evidence. Brice shifts the blame to Pritchard, arguing that Pritchard was jealous of his relationship with Susan. A devastated Pritchard commits suicide with a pistol right there in his office. When the military police enter, the guilt-ridden Brice then turns himself in as being the one who killed Susan Atwell and that her KGB lover never existed. The film ends with a surprising plot twist. Several days later, Farrell is mourning at Susan's grave when two plainclothes men arrive and take him away for questioning to a local hotel where another man emerges from behind a two-way mirror. The interrogator is Farrell's landlord Mr. Schiller (Michael Shillo). After a few moments, he addresses Farrell in Russian and Farrell responds in kind. Farrell is, in fact, the real \"Yuri,\" and his landlord is his KGB supervisor and handler. Yuri/Farrell was planted in the U.S.A. as a teenager and became the \"mole\" in the Department of Defense this whole time. As the KGB was aware of Brice's affair, Farrell was assigned to seduce Atwell and gather intelligence from the Secretary of Defense's mistress. Although his handlers demand that he return to the Soviet Union immediately since his cover was nearly blown, Farrell refuses and leaves. The KGB agents are about to chase after him when Schiller stops them and tells them to let Farrell go for the time being. Schiller quips: \"He'll be back. Where else does he have to go?\"",

         "\"No Way Out\" is one of the most original, suspenseful, tightly-knit thrillers ever made, comparable to John Frankenheimer's \"Seven Days in May\". Set in the Cold War era, Gene Hackman plays the Secretary of Defense, a married man obsessed with his mistress, the exquisitely beautiful Sean Young...as is her other secret lover, Costner, a Naval Admiral who is the C.I.A.'s Liaison. When Hackman accidentally kills Young in a jealous rage, a cover-up begins to find the notorious, never-seen Russian mole \"Yuri\" who works within the Pentagon, and to frame him for the murder. Costner is commanded to oversee the operation, and the action begins...and is sustained with the intensity of a race on the Autobahn. The amazing all-star cast also features Will Patton, George Dzunda, Iman and David Paymer. Costner delivers what is perhaps his most subtle performance. What distinguishes \"No Way Out\" is its brilliant plotting, tautness, and constant surprises...with the ending being the most deliriously mind-blowing surprise of all.",
         "This film is a taut thriller and has a very good pairing of Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman in a story of a cover-up and murder. Sean Young is the tragic figure who falls for Costner and sets in motion the wheels that make this picture one of the best of its type. Plot twists and suspense are highlighted by great acting, and as the cover-up unravels, Costner finds himself in increasing danger in the halls of the Pentagon. Will Patton and George Dzunda are solid in support of the leads although Patton is a bit over the top as Hackman's attack dog. This fine film is marred by an ending that doesn't connect with the film's plot or pulse and gives the picture an awkward, unsatisfying conclusion. Costner is the hero but it is Hackman who makes this picture as good as it is.",
         "There are only a fistful movies I gave 9 points. This is one them. After watching it I immediately had an itch to watch a sequel (regrettably impossible due to the story line). Didn't actually want it to stop and was sad that it ended. (True for just a few other movies, like for example Dr. Zhivago or 12 Monkeys) When I checked the IMDb - rating composition to find out why this movie is so grotesquely underrated, I asserted that the IMDb Staff gave 8 points, anyway. (Phew!) One of the very few US-thrillers, the end of which I wasn't able to predict. Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner are habitually brilliant, Will Patton deserves an Oscar as the best supporting actor in my book.",
         "Kevin Costner stars in this stylish remake of THE BIG CLOCK, a 1948 film noir that starred Ray Milland and Charles Laughton. The setting has been changed from a publishing house to the Pentagon and the time period updated. Some extra plot twists have been added and it all adds up to riveting entertainment after a slow start. Costner romances Sean Young after a brief flirtation and then discovers she is the mistress of the U.S. Secretary of Defense (Gene Hackman). In a fit of jealousy, Hackman accidentally kills Young and then must concoct a plot to keep his identity as her lover a secret. He assigns Costner to lead the investigation and this leads to a suspenseful turn of events that has Costner caught in a net from which he has a hard time escaping. A series of suspenseful chases take place with some excellent camerawork following the chase by car and on foot. Only weakness here is the rather contrived ending which seems to have been added on for a final twist that is never quite convincing. Kevin Costner, looking spiffy in his smart Navy white uniform, does an excellent job as a desperate man realizing he must keep his own affair with the victim a secret. Gene Hackman is excellent too but it is Will Patton as his loyal henchman and protector who gives the film's most penetrating performance, especially when his diabolical nature is revealed. The first twenty-five minutes are much too slow in getting the story off the ground but once it does you'll want to stay tuned until the final denouement. One of the best thrillers produced in the '80s.",
         "No Way Out is a suspense movie set during the cold war. Political intrigue within the US government is the focus of the film. The politically powerful Brice accidentally kills his mistress. Things get out of hand and he decides to frame her other lover as a spy. He knows that she is seeing someone else but has no idea who. Farrel, her other lover, is the man assigned to her case. He realizes that the investigation will eventually expose him, and when the investigators begin using a computer to restore a partially developed polaroid of Farrel found in the dead girlÕs things he has a good idea of how much time he has. There are some tense moments as Farrel trys to expose Brice before he is caught. Also there are a string of neat twists at the end, which succeed in not being corny. This is worth your time. I definitely recommend it for fans of military suspense or cold war movies.",
         "Having lived around the outskirts of Washington, D.C. myself, it's always a nice treat to watch a film that literally takes place right where I have stood, at one time or another. It's just very fun to know that a famous movie was shot where you once walked. (Although I now regret visiting the set of \"101 Dalmations\" in London--that's one story I don't often tell people with a smile on my face.) At the beginning of \"No Way Out,\" we get to see Washington from above as the camera glides through the air, swerving and going around in circles, until we land inside a small interrogation room housing a convicted murderer (Kevin Costner), who is in fact innocent and has been framed. \"When's he coming out?\" he asks as he walks over to a one-way mirror and looks through the glass. Right as we start to think, \"Whom is he talking to?\" (Or \"Does he mean Hackman?\" if you've read anything about the film), we fall backwards in time and land in the same place some number of months earlier. \"No Way Out\" is a government thriller about an officer wrongly accused of murder--when the Secretary of State himself is the culprit trying to avoid a scandal by launching a top-secret cover-up. Costner is the officer, and Gene Hackman is the Secretary of State. After meeting a beautiful young woman (Sean Young) at a party, Costner takes her into a limo and they have a quickie--before they even know each other's names. What's this got to do with anything? Why is my review so choppy and linear-challenged? We'll get there. The relationship between the two turns into a big romance until Costner is sent out to sea, where he saves a sailor from falling overboard and is praised in all the papers--where his girlfriend back home sees his face and is reminded of him. (Now she's the mistress of Hackman, by the way--that complicates matters quite a bit.) When he arrives back home, they go on a romantic getaway--but Hackman finds out and accidentally murders the girl while trying to get her to tell him the name of her lover. Ready to turn himself in, Hackman is persuaded by his gay friend to cover everything up and blame someone else. The gay man even goes and gets rid of the evidence himself--with pride, I might add. (It's like Mr. Burns and Smithers from \"The Simpsons\"--the latter loves the former, but the former is too powerful and naive to ever notice.) The clever twist in \"No Way Out\" is that Costner knows Hackman killed Young, but Hackman doesn't know that he knows that. (Get it?) As he runs around the Pentagon and other government establishments, the evidence starts to pile up against him--the negative off the back of a Polaroid camera, a few eyewitnesses who claim they saw a man outside Young's apartment the night of her murder, etc. The great thing about \"No Way Out,\" and another factor that separates it from the rest of its kind, is something that's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen the film. Essentially, no one knows who killed the girl--and Costner isn't placed under arrest straight away because no one has uncovered any evidence pointing towards him. As the negative off the back of the Polaroid is scanned through a computer and painstakingly altered to reveal the man's face on the photo, Costner runs around trying to eliminate evidence before anyone finds out. The photo will eventually reveal his own face, yes, but he has a number of hours until then to find the true evidence that convicts Hackman. This is a smart thriller with a few pleasant twists, particularly the very end. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's well-acted and solidly directed by Roger Donaldson, who also made last year's \"The Recruit\" with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell. The guy obviously likes government thrillers. This one is a lot more plausible than \"The Recruit,\" too. 4/5 stars. - John Ulmer",
         "In Washington, the Defense Secretary David Brice (Gene Hackman) has a political dispute with Senator William 'Billy' Duvall (Howard Duff) about the project of a submarine. He asks his adviser Scott Pritchard (Will Patton) to invite the Navy Lieutenant Commander Tom Farrell (Kevin Costner), who has become a national hero after rescuing a sailor during a storm, to join his team. Farrell meets Susan Atwell (Sean Young) in a party and they have a torrid love affair. Farrell learns that Susan is Brice's mistress but he falls in love with her. They spend a weekend together and when they return to Susan's apartment, Brice rings the bell. The upset Farrell leaves the apartment and sees Brice waiting for Susan. Brice has an argument with Susan and pushes her from the balcony. She falls on a glass table and dies. Brice panics and reports the accident to Pritchard. However, the Machiavellian chief of staff accuses the imaginary Soviet mole Yuri of murdering Susan. Farrell is assigned to lead the investigations to find the identity of Yuri, and gets in serious situation with the presence of witnesses of his weekend with Susan and the regeneration of a Polaroid photo that was found in Susan's apartment. \"No Way Out\" is an excellent thriller of the 80's even when you see it for the fourth time. The impact of course is reduced, since the plot has one of the most unexpected conclusions, with a twist in the very end that was the motive of several discussions with friends, but it is still a great film. This is one of the best roles of Kevin Costner and Sean Young is incredibly beautiful and sensual. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"Sem Saída\" (\"No Way Out\")",
         "A naval officer becomes a hero after rescuing his ship crew from a whirlpool in Atlantic. By means of his international intelligence service experience -which is hidden in story until the ending- he's hired by a job in Pentagon to work as an assistant of National Defense minister. Through KGB connections the defence ministry gives him a top secret mission to exterminate a CIA funding operation called The Phantom Submarine, but to let the media know what's going on, his heroic rescue is being shown to cloak the facts with KGB. Though it's a remake of Yves Montand's Police Python and John Farrow's The Big Clock, this film offers couple surprises and endless suspense. Compare it with the best movies of 1987, Timothy Dalton's James Bond flick \"The Living Daylights\" or Charlie Sheen's \"Wall Street\" is not offering you anything as a surprising and twisted story. No Way Out possesses a sense of film noir from the post-modern world war-II era. For me in every aspect No Way Out comes before its comparisons if the consideration is onto plot, story, thriller, suspense. Those were the factors what makes No Way Out favoured and likable. But for professional audiences and concerns, first of all No Way Out has everything in common with the Film Noir age movies; a hero and his squeeze, he's growing suspect if she's on cheating him, suddenly she dies creating a twist in the story, hero runs after to solve the mystery of her death, as simple as that. It doesn't have an effective drama plot or no good sub-plots. The only purpose is to sell more tickets. It has all the necessities for a populist production, but doesn't reflect any messages, it doesn't tell nothing to the viewer. Things happen and we watch it with excitement, wondering what's gonna happen next, that's all. The filming and directing dexterity as a whole production is what the main problem is. No wonder why no awards for this movie. Considering Redford & Dunaway's \"Three Days of The Condor(1975)\", I expected to see better intelligence bureau movies in 1980s and 1990s. But not until 21st century you come across another good governmental crime. After the death of the leading actress in the film, the romance segment ends off, then we're stuck in the Pentagon, watching things happening between CIA, NSA and KGB all trying to give an end to a scandal before it rises. If you're looking to find a good crime film, you're in the wrong place. I will finish up with what I liked most in No Way Out. It's a great popcorn movie, a perfect choice for having fun with family or with spouse/girlfriend. Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman together enhances the viewing quality. One of the best movies of Kevin Costner, and includes some memorable moments of him with his female cast-mate. Just for its moments of romance its better than Top Gun. Remember Top Gun was half-a-romance movie, this was even one-third in length. 1980s was the generation when all the women in the world dreamt and fantasized of MEN IN UNIFORM.",
         "I remember being in the theater with my friend, and she turned to me and said about Costner \"He is just so good in this film\" and I replied \"He will be somebody someday.\" This was that kind of film. You felt the performances in your bones. The film had that type of chemistry between all the major players. The plot would just seem like it was going to lag and then you get twisted around again. Three years later I went out and bought the script with a month's worth of money from my first job. I still have that script on my bookshelf. I also have had a copy of this film in my collection for the last 10 years. Sean Young was still at her peak and the limousine scene is unforgettable. It is also proof that you can add sex in a movie without making the audience think they will be taking time away from the theme and plot of the movie. Will Patton of Remember the Titans was also starting his movie career and played his character of a \"protect the Director at any cost\" to a \"T\". Gene Hackman was Brice in this movie. George Dzundza as the loyal friend, Iman as the South African caught in the middle of her friend's indiscretion and Chris D. as one of the \"Contras\" helped round out the supporting cast. Roger Donaldson's direction really helped you feel the tense pace and the closed in feelings in the Pentagon. I gave this film a 9 because it may be seen as outdated due to some cold war references.",
         "Tom Farrell is offered a job within the Defence department under Brice, the secretary of defence. When the two begin seeing the same woman, Farrell is forced to do so quietly so that Brice doesn't know. When Brice finds that Susan is seeing another woman he accidentally kills her. In order to cover up Brice's involvement, his aide Pritchard engineers a theory that the \"other man\" in Susan's life was the one that killed her and that he is a legendary Russian spy. In order to keep control of the investigation, Farrell is put in charge of the investigation and is faced with clues that he knows will eventually lead to him. With the set-up closing in on him he must race against time to find a way out. This is a remake of The Big Clock, with a modern political set-up. The story is well set-up with only some misgivings in the first 30 minutes where the roots for the story are developed. Once the real story starts it is very good and it moves with a real thrilling pace, building to two endings one very powerful and with a feeling of being trapped, and the second being a clever if not totally convincing twist. The feeling of being trapped and closed in on is very palatable and is very well conveyed for most of the film. Costner is excellent here (a long time before his bubble burst) and Hackman brings his usual class. The standout role is Patton's smarmy, spin doctor homosexual Pritchard, he is truly excellent and manages to bring a sense of menace to a quite feminine role. Overall an excellent thriller that is slow to start and has a low-key ending. The only problems are the slightly stretched plot and some of the action being unexplained (why do the covert-ops guys keep chasing Costner? I understood why for one of the chases but other ones just seem to happen for no reason). But 7 out of 10."
