         "I just couldn't leave the last comment to this movie as it was. I haven't seen the English dubbed version, so this might be a reason why you got such a bad impression of the movie. Having seen the original German version, I must disagree. It's not MTV 'fodder' and the characters are not stereotypical. Actually, the movie leaves a lot in the dark about the character, things you have to think about yourself when watching it. If this was 'overexplained' in the English version to make it easier for the audience, it's not the fault of the director or the plot. It IS an awfully good movie, but seeing the bad critics it got from the English speaking part, I'd advise you to watch the German version.",
         "This movie has a great soundtrack -- actually written and performed by the cast. Jazzee (Tabatabai) is an amazing song writer, and cute, too. Coco Krebitz and Katja Riemann are lovely and quite talented. Drags a little in the middle, but other than that it's a fun film worth seeing (I've seen it four times myself). Summary: Appealing cast, great music, terrific cinematography, clever dialogue. Four out of five stars from me!",
         "Telling of a rock group of four imprisoned females who escape and enjoy overnight commercial musical success because of their notoriety, \"Bandits\" is not of the sexsational genre of B-flicks about women in prison commonplace in America. Instead it is a stylish, artfully shot sort of quasi-musical-drama-rock-video out of Germany with verve, solid music, a creative story, and a captivating screenplay. \"Bandits\", which received high marks from critics and viewers, is just real enough to get involved with while being just unreal enough to make rooting for the escapees easily rationalized. Love the ending. Worth a look for those into \"girl power\" and rock music.",
         "Hey, this definitely is one to watch. A one of a kind \"German Females Shawshank Redemption goes Rock'n Roll.\" It was a big hit in Germany, though of course that is usually a deterrent for some odd reason. Don't let it be. If you follow video and DVD Releases, you will know it has been available for a few months now (finally) in the USA, where, I believe a movie like this would be a huge success. That is of course if it were in American English and starred Julia Roberts, instead of Katja Riemann, a big star in Germany, but of course a nobody in the US, in spite appearing in the only German movies released in the US in the past 5 years including Der Bewegte Mann - MAYBE, MAYBE NOT, and the COMEDIAN HARMONISTS. She is awesome in this role. If you like prison films, and triumph of the underdog, seemingly against all odds, run and rent this film. It is for you. As the Shawshank Redemption remains the second top-rated movie of all time here, it would follow that BANDITS should be a comparable success in the foreign film department. Additionally, it has all that female bonding which men (who usually make up over 52% of the audience) and I believe most emancipated women love to watch. See it now. You never know when these European films suddenly go out of print. In Germany, it will always be available, and is already a classic, as the previous comment indicates, and represents the majority opinion here. But no one can pinpoint why German movies are just being totally ignored since the 80s, when in fact, they have experienced a rebirth, and have become so much more accessible, so much more American, as has been the trend in almost everything in post World War II Germany. (RUN, LOLA, RUN to many is not really a movie, but a series of music videos according to many, and so can not really be called an exception.) But BANDITS is a real movie, not particularly German AT ALL. Most people will really get a kick out of it if they only gave it a shot. Watch it.",
         "While watching movies about music or musicians, I often sympathize with these poor bastards of actors: The script requires them to play - say - a guitar, but they obviously have no clue as to how to even hold this instrument. And then the singing voice sounds so suspiciously different from the one they talk with... In this respect, 'Bandits' is a welcome surprise: Obviously, these actresses know far more than just the pure basics of their instruments and deliver a convincing performance as a rock band. And sitting through to the end of the credits reveals that they not only did their own singing, but wrote the major part of the music and lyrics by themselves, most notably \"Luna\" Jasmin Tabatabai. For me, the great music more than compensates for the rather fantastic, sometimes clichéd plot with some minor holes. All in all, a remarkable movie!",
         "No movie is perfect-not even the Godfather!Every movie has flaws, and in stating that this German film had quite a few.The genre seemed to switch between music video/musical (with dance sequences or some type of choreography) and drama.This said there were several surreal scenes, and a critique of the plot should keep this in mind.THE PLOT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE BELIEVABLE!!-four women with different criminal backgrounds fight for thweir emancipation/try to escape from the law while trying to maintain their rock 'n' roll career.Yes, I do agree that some issues/conflicts could have been further developed e.g. the conflict between the two band members over the cute male hostage,the conflict of stardom and infamy,etc.It is interesting to note that being a rock musician is synonymous with being an outlaw.Defying figures of authority and statues of law.So the writers had a interesting concept to work with.The soundtrack was inspiring and simply rocked!!(how come they spoke in German and sung in pure English).Love the song of the final scene-Don't forget to catch me!!The actresses were blessed with talent!!All in all, the film had such an appeal to me and I love it anyhoo.",
         "I enjoyed this movie more than most of the American movies I've seen in the past year. It's also different from any other movies I've ever seen. The acting is great, and all of the characters are interesting...plus, I have to get the soundtrack. It's hard to find movies that are this original and entertaining.",
         "Now I know not just Hollywood produce fast-food teen movies. The form is attractive enough. Rock'n sex'n fame, nowadays teens' dream life. Runaway chick rock band from prison. Hmm, It could be a \"Bonny and Clyde\" type of material. But the director shows no interest in examining human nature. The characters don't care much about freedom. In no way their behaviour could possible derive any success, let alone human triumph. The director is only obsessed with showcasing rock music (what a band, they don't even play much original German rock song?), making it look like those cheap MTV. Ladies in the movie seems still in their teen days. Besides music, they only seems to interest in making love. I have no sympathy for the two hollywoodized young band member, who had bitter affair with the same irresponsible cute boy on the street. They got only themselves to blame. This movie about the girl band is definitely not for girls. The plot is lame enough to adding the beat-up story of the mid-class drummer and the story of mid-age mother for her dead son. Both stories are so stereotyped that I eventually get bored. It had great potential. Like the story of the suicidal mid-age mother, though not much rock spirit. This kind of self destruction could be generated by years of the prison experience . \"Shawhank's redemption\" examined and expressed similar facet. But this director choose just put spread her hormone and left the mess around. It is easy to admire the life on the edge. It is easier to get what is brought out superficially, especially in the fast changing e-days. It has its fun moment. The movie try to switch between reality and surreal. Those rock until you have nowhere to run scene. The fate of Inevitable failure. Pretty impressive. Due to lack of vision, the director didn't explore all the potential of the movie. Maybe I shouldn't take this movie too seriously. But after terrific German movies like \"Run lola Run\" (similar scene of girl on the run) and \"Comedian Harmonists\" (similar for a story about a musical group), this is really a let down!",
         "The \"Bandits\" show extraordinary circumstances of the heightened possibilities of human life. The skin shapes in women's prison, which reflect meticulously composed images that threaten to overwhelm the viewer's sensibilities, makes actress Jasmin Tabatabai a personification of the heroine of an action thriller. Her performance makes a compelling passion below her rebellious surface. The script takes the audience on a ride full of peaks and valleys, forcing them to experience a full range of emotion in a very short time. All four female actresses, Emma (Katja Riemann), Luna, (Jasmin Tabatabai), Angel (Nicolette Krebitz), Marie (Jutta Hoffmann), performed superbly in their scripted characters, yet, none of them is particularly happy with their lot in life. From the moment they escape from the police vehicle, one thing leads to another and they throw off the shackles of their old existence, and turn, instead, to fugitives-on-the-run and ironically they become celebrities who orchestrate a pop-rock band, \"The Bandits,\" selling their albums while being on the run. The movie perhaps is articulating the distaff aspects of human life. The women live in a man's world full of sexist slobs. The theme rotates on freedom, not necessarily from the prison, but from a male-ordered universe. The women, have financial freedom, which translated into world terms, and means economic security for the female gender. Their journey is absolutely a classic one. Four women, buddies, heading out together into the nowhere land, away from structure, away from conventional civilization and responsibilities, sometimes into romantic destruction in the quest for \"freedom,\" at all cost. Outlaw roles usually reserved for males, but viewers here see women coming into self-knowledge and finding their aggressive nature. In this awe-inspiring acting, Jasmin Tabatabai, a Persian-German actress, plays her role and pattern just perfectly. She has the talent and a great artistic ability and temperament. She has a delightful voice and very expressive face and gestures. She is supremely confident in her ability to create a unique person. She has what it takes to elevate the motion picture to superlative heights. Acting becomes an art of persuasion for her in the Bandits. She has claimed of the nobility of this art, and then she received the acclaim of her audience. She has become an important element in the success of this movie as the illuminator of the human heart in the society. Actors must absolutely complement each other in order to come up with a memorable performance, as we see in the Bandits the harmonious and natural performance from our four beautiful German Actresses.",
         "There have been many movies about people escaping from jail, but few (maybe none) are like \"Bandits\". It focuses on a group of disgruntled young women in a German prison. When they get a chance to play outside the prison, they naturally use that chance to escape. But that's where the movie takes a surprise turn. The become the most popular band in the country. It's a really funny movie (yes, the Germans can be funny). I particularly liked some of the things that they said while packing airplane utensils, and just the way that one of the women had a sarcastic attitude and chose to go around bending the rules just a little. A modern classic."
