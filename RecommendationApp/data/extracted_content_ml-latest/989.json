         "While certainly to many American viewers this film lacks the flare of Hollywood, but that's what it so exquisite about it. I am not exactly a film connoisseur, I am American foreign film fan and I know that this film probably does not appeal to the general public. However for those who like psychological thrillers and stories about misunderstood and socially inept geniuses, this is amazing. The music and cinematography is fantastic. Plus this film incorporated 3 of my favorite German actors. The way that the sound was utilized is just unbelievable as well. For the intellectuals out there who appreciate art in all things, rent or buy this one.",
         "To the person who said this film is not worth your time ... well, your \"review\" of the film is not worth the time of half the members of IMDb, but why should I be surprised when all I ever find on this website are people trying to outwit each other with their supposed intellectual superiority? The film is based on a book by Robert Schneider, who also wrote the screenplay. Having read both the book and seen the film, I think the film was a decent adaptation. As one review I read said, the director did seem to take a more stylistic and overall artistic angle on the story, and as such much of the finest material from the book was lost. However, the film itself is still an excellent piece of work and stands on its own, aside from the book, as a remarkable movie. I'm not sure I noticed anything about \"horrible sound effects\", but I remember first seeing this film several years ago on Bravo late one night, and I could not get it out of my head for the next several YEARS ... until I discovered Amazon and was able to find an imported copy to purchase for my own. Only a year ago did I actually read the book, which was incredibly engrossing, and I encourage anyone who enjoyed the film to tackle the literary version as well. The cinematography and the overwhelming metaphysical essence present in this film are what truly sucked me in. The story itself is simply beautiful in the same way that any tragedy, whether Greek or Shakespearean or whathaveyou, is captivatingly melancholy. It resonates within you and makes your heart ache for days afterward. Personally, I found the main character, Elias, to be the most fascinating element of the film. And of course, the scene in which he \"opens the gates of heaven\" with his sheer musical virtuosity is riveting to behold. This film is truly a delectable treat for the senses. Anyone who is truly passionate about their talent or art will relate to the \"tortured artist\" persona that is Elias - the isolation, the dedication to your craft in spite of other desires which we cannot displace, and the embodiment of the emotional realm that so frequently serves as the origin of our inspiration ... this is what the story is truly about. If you can appreciate that, you will love this film.",
         "the movie is based on the book written by the Austrian writer Robert Schneider and expands on it beautifully. it can be a bit difficult to follow and if you are looking for an action packed thriller, this is not the movie for you. The main character, Elias Alder, is born in 1803 into a town in the Austrian mountains. The town is so remote, that it is practically never visited by outsiders, and the inhabitants do not leave. there are only two families living in the village, continuously feuding, leading lives that go nowhere. here Elias is born with perfect (even supernatural) hearing. both the book and the movie illustrate the merciless life in a town that has been dying for for years and the life of a young man born with an extraordinary gift, which is worthless in the life and world he is born into. the tag-line \"wer schlaeft liebt nicht\" translates to \"he who sleeps, does not love\" - one of the lines from the movie - and the title give ample indication of the characters' futile lives. \"schlafes bruder\" or \"sleep's brother\" is death.",
         "I had to read the novel by Robert Schneider for lit class years ago, and I still read the book from time to time. Before I first saw the film, I already knew that it would never be able to do justice to the book. Some things, like Elias' performance at the organ festival, can't be portrayed in a film, I think. The film's not awful, but it leaves out a few things that are quite important in the book. The acting in general is a little over the top, (and personally I think the female lead was a little too old for her part, if you keep in mind that the male lead is around 22 and she's supposed to be younger.. although I'm willing to look past that..). It's like they tried a little too hard with this movie. All in all, let me wrap it up like this: I borrowed the tape to a friend and never got it back. And it doesn't bother me much... Or, even shorter: Book good. Movie not so good.",
         "This is a good film, actually. It's not extremely faithful to the novel, which is not a bad thing in itself, and if you know the novel, you will understand that there are some aspects of it that couldn't be expressed very well in a film. So they added and changed quite a bit of the story and expanded on the novel, which makes the film interesting to see even if you already know the book, but for some reason they apparently tried to \"modernise\" the character of Elsbeth by what she is made rather implausible. Still, it's a good movie, well executed, beautifully shot, with a great film score and great cast and acting, rather inspired.",
         "The 1st major character was well rejected or teased by other people of the similar ages. Quite often, he was left alone. His dad had been supportive but still not much help on his poor connexion to his generation. Music seems to be the only easiest thing to grow up with when alone. He was lucky to have a great devoted companion, Pete, who loves him since his childhood so that he can get an organ fixed and played. Since his father and his only childhood best friend treat him so well that he needs no hard work on almost anything. Plus, he was born with music talent. He never has to work hard on anything to get something or someone. And even the girl of his life, he can easily win her heart by chatting and dating her. Yet, he never learns to interact socially, sexually or flirtatiously. His lack of response on further interaction just confuses her and drives her mad doing things she shouldn't. On the other hand, his childhood best friend, also the elder brother of the girl of his life, gets jealous at his sister for his lust to possess him. As imagined, the resultant is a drama like a fire that will agonise themselves to \"Schlafes Bruder\" as a result.",
         "I made the mistake to read the novel two days before i went to the cinema to see Schlafes Bruder. I loved the book and would have left the cinema after half of the film if i hadn't been invited (so i could not run away). The story is completely different from the novel and i cannot understand how the author could let this happen - and helped working out the terrible script! It's really a pity. Vilsmair once again pushed his wife into the film, althogh there wouldn't be any part in the book matching for her. (I once saw Stalingrad from Vilsmair and was sure that i wouldn't see Mrs Vavrova, because i expected only men in this film. Poor me! Of cours Vilsmair found once again a role for his wife!) So the tiny, tender and silent Elsbeth, a 17-year old girl, is played by a thirty-year-old woman like a man eating vamp from the countryside. Ridiculous! In the novel everybody admires Elias Alder for playing the organ in church like an angel. He plays the old church songs like no one did before and made the hearts of the people weak and happy. In the film he plays experimental music, he beats the organ like a madman - i think that the inhabitants of a small austrian village would have beaten him out of the church if he did play that way! I liked Eisermann and Becker, they are always good to watch. But it's a waste of time watching this embarassing movie if you like the book - and the book is really great!",
         "The film chronicles life of a natural born music genius with several motifs. Motifs include beauty in innocents and nature, hypocrisy in Church of small village, greed and jealousy over love and ultimate sacrifice. This is also a rare film to feature not only the expression of aleatoric or in the moment expression of music but also makes the connection that this expression is divine nature. The cast of characters is vast and so forth the dynamics between characters evoke deep thought and emotion. The mechanics and continuity of the film are smooth and clear. There is nothing embellished about the film except there is an echo effect added to certain audio and vocal sets that emphasize.",
         "... and forget the movie! It's terrible! Does Dana Vavrova have anything in hands to blackmail her husband, the director Joseph Vilsmaier? Or why does he always give her the female leading part, no matter if she's the right or the wrong one for the picture. In the book the girl is simple, young, naive and 17 years old, and she never gets the idea that Elias could have feelings for her. Vavrova plays her as a man eating woman in the thirties, who holds him tight, yelling \"Take me, take me!\" Forget it! It's a nightmare, and I can't understand that the author of this brilliant novel gave his OK to this awfully bad picture.",
         "All in all a stunningly filmed piece of work - if somewhat cheesy at the end - liked the first organ recital the lead gave - primo - the last one was gas too. The gay theme was cool - if a little strange - I mean you'd have thought the main man wud have cottoned-on to Peter's intense feelings for him...o...well...ya get that in the 'real' world of film! All in all a great watch with some stunning cinemagraphic tableauxs..somewhat spoilt by a script with a weak ending."

         "In the beginning of the 19th century, Johannes Elias Alder is born in a small village in the Austrian mountains. While growing up he is considered strange by the other villagers and discovers his love to music, especially to playing the organ at the local church. After experiencing an \"acoustic wonder\", his eye color changes and he can hear even the most subtle sounds. Elias falls in platonic love with Elsbeth, the sister of Peter, a neighbor's son, who has loving feelings towards Elias ever since. After Elsbeth marries someone else, Elias (aged 22) decides to end his life by not sleeping anymore.",
         "Following motifs of the best seller of the same name by Robert Schneider, the film tells the story of musician Elias Alder, who brought his life to an end at the age of 22 having decided not to sleep any more. In a mountain village isolated from the world, the fate is fulfilled of a man mortally afflicted by a musical genius which prevents him from following the beating of his heart and settling for happiness with the woman whom he loves more than his own life.
