         "Personally this is one of my all time favorite movies since I was very young. That being said I had not seen this movie in over a decade before seeing it on the shelf at the grocery store where I purchased it. I had just watched the two Conan movies a few nights prior and I sat down with my lady to watch an old favorite. To me this movie was infinitely more enjoyable than the Conan movies. And even as an adult some 20 years later with a much wider and esoteric taste in movies, music and games; I found this movie a blast and I'm not going to say it's a 10 and nor am I going to play the role of lap top critic. I'm just going to say this: In a world of horrible blockbusters like GI Joe and Transformers I feel Red Sonja was money and time well spent.",
         "I'm a great fan of the Conan series and of course my favourite is the first of the series \"Conan the Barbarian\". I bought Red Sonja on DVD for only $9.95 and I was surprised to find as entertaining as the first two Conan films. Arnold Schwarzenegger executed his character outstanding throughout the fight scenes and as Kalidor even though the film was focused on Red Sonja. Brigitte Nielsen was beautiful and played Red Sonja perfectly to heighten the suspense and action through the fight scenes. The Film quality was good into creating a fantasy environment. The Action scenes in this film was the main part that me through this film even though its PG there's enough blood for the warmongers to enjoy. To conclude whoever loves Barbaric films such as the Conan films or Kull the Conqueror this is the film for you. Conan The Barbarian (1982) 8/10 Conan The Destroyer (1984) 6/10 Red Sonja (1985) 6/10",
         "This movie gets better with age. If you've got a sense of humor and don't need Industrial Light and Magic special effects, the combination of actors (all playing off the winsome Brigette Nielson) makes this a fun movie to see again...or for the first time. It's probably also the movie that got Arnold in hot water during the \"recall.\"",
         "This is a wonderfully moral sword and sorcery epic. Arnold Schwarzenegger portrays a heroic man of high character unlike the amoral Conan. His portrayal of Kalidor is understated and that makes it WORK. Brigitte Nielsen while a raw talent, still manages to put this film over. She is what one expects a Red Sonja to be: a simple, brave, barbarian woman with a sense of loyalty and oath upholding that is so alien to our modern world. Sandahl Bergman as the nefarious Queen Gedren is marvelous. She has a plum role playing a villainous megalomaniac and she enjoys every minute of it. Paul Smith and his sidekick Ernie Reyes Jr. almost steal the show, quite charming. Again there is a humanity in Smith's character, this loyalty and taking seriously of an oath that rings true for the imagined world of this sword and sorcery entry. Tutte Lemkow's portrayal of a wizard is one of the minor roles that is very well done. Of all the sword and sandal movies I have seen over the years I have a special place for this 1985 film. It is a feel good movie, romantic, exciting, beautiful scenery and costumes and an excellent ARNOLD film.",
         "Quote of the movie: \"so it is true, only women may touch it\" What was good: The Soundtrack was really good thanks to genus, Ennio Morricone. Red Sonja looked really good in that little cloth piece she wore throughout the movie. There is more red hair in this film than a shedding Irish Setter. What was bad: The little kid playing the ruler of a land terribly over acts. I am not sure if this is because he is a bad kid actor or if it was suppose to be. There was a scene where Arnold rides around hitting people from his horse, but in a wide-angle shot, there is nobody dead on the ground. The special effects for 1985 are fairly lame, including the mechanical spider in the castle lair is so bad-dd. The costumes were designed as if there was a sale at a early 1980's salvation army. Costume of the movie goes to the oriental old man, \"grandmaster\", with the white sheet and black straps is quite a sight. With poles that come out of his back, I don't know how he can enter a doorway. It takes 18 minutes for Arnold to actually read a line. A fun movie to drink a little and laugh at the action or lack of action. This movie could of been done a lot worse.",
         "Not really my bag as far as movie types go (not really into the fantastical) but I'm glad I saw this film. There seemed to be very little use of stuntpersons or body doubles in the majority of fight scenes. Bridgette Nielsen clearly worked it off to put on a good showing. How Schwarzanegger got top billing I'm not sure, but his limited part was, of course, excellently portrayed. Film quality was fair, considering the fantasy-esque backdrop and the fact that it was shot in the early 80s. I'll go out wide on a limb and give it a couple of stars. My take: 6.5",
         "OK, I know I'm going to either get a lot of hate for this and a lot of confused emails, but Red Sonja to me is an ultimate guilty pleasure. My sister and I used to watch this movie all the time when we were kids, we both wanted to so badly fight with Red Sonja and be apart of the group. So oddly, after years of not watching this since I was a kid, my sister and I found the DVD for 5 dollars and decided to watch it. Oh, the things that are so wrong with this film that makes it so right again. Looking to be a spin off of Conan, we were introduced to Red Sonja played by Flava-Flav's ultimate true love, Bridgitte Nielson. The 6 foot tall drink of glass shows us that this was her acting class as she rehearses her lines as if she had just read them the night before and screams \"Gedren, where are you?!\" while moving her mouth in the strangest way. She teams up with world's other tall drink of \u0085 beef(?) Arnold Schwarzenegger as they battle it out on who can act the worst? Well, who knows who will win with this silly story. A large temple full of white-robed priestesses are getting ready to destroy a large, glowing green orb called the Talisman. This dangerous artifact's destructive power increases from exposure to light and the priestesses intend to destroy it before it gets out of control. However, the evil Queen Gedren and Ikol attack with their army. The warrior-priestesses resist, but are ultimately subdued by Gedren's forces. Gedren gets her hands on the Talisman, but not before proving the myth that only women can touch it and survive. Gedren orders the remaining priestesses to be imprisoned in the vault which held the Talisman. One of those priestesses, Varna, manages to escape. She doesn't get far before she's mortally wounded by an arrow in the back. As luck would have it, she literally falls into the arms of the mighty Lord Kalidor. She begs him to help find her sister, Red Sonja. Sonja has been training with a Chinese sword master when Kalidor informs Sonja about her sister. Sonja arrives just in time for Varna to tell her about what happened at the temple. Before dying, Sonja's sister urges her to find the Talisman and destroy it, or else the world will be destroyed. Everything about this movie is bad, but that's what I love about it. You know how sometimes you just need a bad movie that you can make fun of and have a good time with? Supposedly, Arnold Schwarzenegger jokes that he uses this movie as punishment for his kids when they act up. Is it that bad? It is bad, but it's a ton of fun. I loved the action, Arnold fighting Bridgitte for her love as no man may have her unless he's trying to kill her, lol. I loved the last fight scene between Red Sonja and Queen Gedren, Gedren loves pulling a ton of jump cuts on her as well as one of Gedren's wizards who is using vodoo to cut Sonja to weaken her, then when she discovers the wizard, instead of him cutting her again, he just stands there, lol. Also the little Prince Tarn with Falkon was classic and they worked so well together. I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Red Sonja, Prince Tarn and Falkon are stuck in the cave with the machine dragon and Arnold is just riding around with it making it look more like a roller coaster ride rather than a fight for his life, lol! My opinion, if a movie entertains you even if it is bad, why fight it? This is a good bad movie and I know I will always enjoy it. My recommendation being if you have an open mind and decide to just let go and enjoy the ride Red Sonja takes you on, take it or leave it. 7/10",
         "I absolutely loved this movie! I know, I know, maybe the acting isn't the BEST we've ever seen, but it's not bad. I loved Brigitte Nielsen in this; she was awesome. And not to mention Ernie Reyes Jr, he was so adorable! I love action movies, and this is an action movie by all means. Arnold was really good too. This movie was really fun and very visual. I really recommend it if you're a fantasy movie nut!",
         "It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production, especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own, and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery. Actually, this isn't as bad as some critics say, but it isn't good, either. It IS amusing, and DOES play like a poor country cousin of the Conan line, making it a conflicted, uneven, poor work. And speaking of poor, the quality is terrible, due to the era in which this was filmed, but that is not the only reason. The story herein is inferior, even to the Conan line, but moreover, it loses itself in the \"Red Sonja must be dominated by big strong Schwarzenegger\" ploy, and entirely forgets its purpose, if it ever had one. It's entertaining, but in a low-budget, guilty-pleasure \"B\" kind of way. It rates a 4.2/10 from... the Fiend :.",
         "This is Saturday afternoon fodder, and it is great fun. Brigitte Nielsen plays Red Sonja a little as though she is reading her lines off hidden cue cards, in fact the entire cast appears to have received the script on the day they began shooting, but this is still great comic book stuff all the same. It lacks the fancy CGI that we have come to expect, and is, in my opinion, actually the better for this lack. The set pieces all work well, and even the very tentative love story is not a major distraction. Settle back to enjoy skimpy skirts and lots of sword play, years before Xena the Warrior Princess hit the small screen."
