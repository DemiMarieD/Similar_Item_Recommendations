         "content": "Friday the 13th VIII: Jason Takes a Boat.\r\n\r\nJason Vorhees is once again brought back to life and goes on a kill crazy spree aboard a boat bound for Manhattan.\r\n\r\nAs is the norm with the \"Friday 13th\" sequels, this one garners scorn and praise in equal measure, so you roll the dice and take your chance really. By now the makers were trying to come up with new ideas to keep the series afloat, here the gimmick is to take Vorhees out of his Camp Crystal Lake \"comfort\" zone, and pitch him on a boat - a boat which naturally is full of ripe high schoolers who are ripe for killing in variously gruesome ways. \r\n\r\nThe presence of Manhattan in the title is not wholly accurate since three quarters of the pic is set on the said boat, with standard series rules applying, though Vorhees seems to have attained the dexterity of a paratrooper given that he remarkably appears in kill scenes where the time frame is impossible for him to do so. The sequences in Manhattan are fun, which only makes one lament that more time wasn't spent on this particular gimmick.\r\n\r\nThe acting is generally weak, while the effects work is standard fare - though the cinematography (Bryan England) is very impressive. So all told, it's another divisive \"Friday\" sequel, from breasts and butts, to blood and bone, and onto The Big Apple, part 8 you will either hate or think it's great. 6/10",

      "synopsis": "One year after the conclusion of the last film (Part 7), a boat's anchor hits an underwater power line cable, causing a short circuit at the bottom of Crystal Lake. As a result, the undead serial killer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) is resurrected once again. He immediately finds the boat's occupants, a high school couple named Jim Miller (Todd Shaffer) and Suzie Donaldson (Tiffany Paulsen), having sex. Obtaining a new hockey mask from the boat (which Jim had previously used to scare Suzie), he kills Jim with the barrel of a harpoon gun. Suzie attempts to hide in a storage hatch, but Jason discovers her and jams the harpoon into her chest. The next morning, the steamer SS Lazarus, containing the senior class of Lakeview High, is bound for nearby New York City for the school's graduation. The trip is chaperoned by Colleen Van Deusen (Barbara Bingham) and biology teacher Charles McCulloch (Peter Mark Richman), who has also brought along his niece, Rennie (Jensen Daggett). Before the ship sets sail, Jason (having somehow sailed Jim and Suzie's boat to the marina) grabs a hold of the ship's anchor and climbs aboard. As the night continues on, Rennie keeps having visions of Jason as a child (Timothy Burr Mirkovich) when he drowned. Jason then starts murdering the people on board, starting with a wannabe rock star named J.J. (Saffron Henderson), whom he kills by bashing her head with her own electric guitar. He then ambushes a young boxer in a sauna and hits him with a sauna rock in his chest. Tamara Mason (Sharlene Martin) goes to take a shower. Jason breaks through the door and strips Tamara, leaving her completely naked. She begs for mercy and tries to hide her nakedness with a bathroom towel as Jason shatters the bathroom mirror and impales her with a broken glass shard. Her dead body is later discovered lying on the floor. Jason then kills the captain of the Lazarus, Admiral Robertson (Warren Munson) and the chief engineer Jim Carlson (Fred Henderson), leaving the two chaperones, Rennie, and the remaining students to try and track down and kill Jason. They fail, after Jason strangles one of the female students, Eva Watanabe (Kelly Hu), on a dance floor, then throws one boy, Miles Wolfe (Gordon Currie), over the captain's quarters and onto the deck post. However, Wayne's death, involving being thrown into a control panel, causes a fire, burning the fuel tanks, and blowing a hole in the ship's hull. Jason then comes extremely close to killing Rennie by almost choking her to death as his bursts his decomposing arm through a porthole. She then manages to stick a pen up his left eye. Then Charles, Rennie, Colleen, two other students, Julius (V.C. Dupree) and the captain's son, Sean Robertson (Scott Reeves), and Rennie's dog, Toby (Ace), abandon the ship in a lifeboat as the ship continues to burn with the remaining students onboard. As the group continues to row to safety, they finally arrive in New York City. Jason has followed them there, however, and kills two gang-bangers. Jason then kills Julius (decapitated by a single punch), then a cop (Roger Barnes) the group comes across. Colleen is killed accidentally when immolated in an exploding car. Finally, Charles is caught by Jason and dunked in a barrel of sewage, leaving Sean and Rennie running for their lives. Rennie has a flashback to an event from her early childhood where she was learning how to swim in Crystal Lake and was almost killed by a young drowned Jason, looking as he did in the original Friday the 13th. The infuriated Jason is now on the warpath and after a chase that spans from the subway system to Times Square, Rennie and Sean first run into a diner, followed by the sewers of Manhattan, where Jason follows and kills a sanitation worker (David Longworth). Rennie and Sean try to escape from the tunnel by climbing up a metal ladder just as a flood of toxic waste races through the tunnel. Rennie manages to knock the persuing Jason off the ladder and whom lands in the toxic waste. Much of Jason's body melts; all that is left is a young boy lying at the bottom of the sewer. Rennie and Sean reunite with the dog Toby on the streets above.",

         "Man, let me tell you, after seeing Friday The 13th Part 7, I was very skeptical about seeing Friday The 13th Part 8. I was thinking that after part 7, the series was going to fall apart. But I was wrong! Friday The 13th Part 8: Jason Takes Manhattan gave a brand new twist onto the Friday The 13th Series, while at the same time keeping the feel of all the originals. One year after Friday The 13th Part 7, Jason is still floating around under water, waiting to be brought back to life. Once Jason is killed, the only thing that can bring him back is an electrical shock. (We learned this in part six) But of course as long as he is deep down under water, he isn't going to be getting any electric voltage any time soon, right? WRONG! Jason is back! And now, he is on a boat to the big apple... New York! This film was very cool. A huge improvement over the 7th film. All the acting skills are great, the gore is pretty good, (not as good as the gore in some of the previous films, but still pretty good) and we finally get something new into the mix! A new location! If you like the Friday The 13th series, you will LOVE Friday The 13th Part 8: Jason Takes Manhattan.",
         "I think Jason fans boil down into two categories - the ones that watch for actual horror and the ones that watch for unintentional humor and shock value. For the former group - this movie is worthless. The change of scenery from the dark, foreboding woods of Camp Crystal Lake to a luxury cruise liner completely ruins Jason's mystique. Jason is a killer made for stalking around the ominous woods, not sauntering through hallways and crosswalks. The kills are numerous and bloody... but don't compare to some of the other installments. Overall, this movie is simply not very scary. For the latter group however, this movie is a gem. Packed full of stereotypes and inexplicably idiotic characters, you can't help but laugh as each one is picked off, Jason-style. With Asian valedictorians, black athletes, and white party girls, the lack of effort that the writers put into the film is clearly evident. It's almost as if the writers got together and tried to figure out how to fit the maximum amount of gratuitous violence and nudity into an hour and a half movie... sheer brilliance. For me? 8/10, one of the best comedies I've seen in a while.",
         "What's up with all these high schools in the movies having these insane senior trips? The kids in Final Destination flew to Europe, and these kids go on a freaking cruise? I went to Magic Mountain for my senior trip! Oh, well, I guess the payback is that in the movies they all get killed. Magic Mountain sounds a lot better in that sense. By this point in the lengthy Friday the 13th saga, it's clear that even the writers of these movies (generally the last people to catch on when they come up with idiotic ideas) have noticed that a lot of teenagers going up to Camp Crystal Lake to be rebellious and get slashed all up is getting a little bit old, so in this installment they decided it would be a good idea to have the movie take place on a whole ship full of high school students. Moving someone like Jason Voorhees from his home on Camp Crystal Lake to an unfamiliar setting is actually a really good idea for generating more interest in the series, because although it's a given in a series like this, I think audiences always like to see familiar characters come back from other stories. So while you already know Jason is going to be in the movie because it's a Friday the 13th, you at least see him in an unfamiliar atmosphere, which removes a lot of the automatic cynicism that is now being generated toward the teenagers who are still stupid enough to go out to the lake. Now we see Jason killing all kinds of kids unsuspectingly on their school trip and then more people on the streets of New York. Amazing the things we find entertaining these days, isn't it? There are a lot of fairly innovative deaths aboard the ship in the first half of the film, such as a guy relaxing in the sauna getting one of the hot rocks shoved through his stomach, a guy getting impaled on the communication antenna on the boat, and throat slit by a machete, an amazingly botched scene. You would think that since it was so obvious the knife didn't even touch that poor guy, they would at least not have done it in such a close-up. Ironically enough, the part that I was anticipating to be the most interesting was the least creatively done. After realizing what is going on on the boat (meaning, after just about all of them had been killed), the surviving students on board get the life raft and escape, rowing out into the dark ocean in hopes of hitting land. Eventually, they see the New York City skyline and jump for joy. I was anticipating a creative and fun romp through the streets of New York, maybe with Jason confused at his surroundings and therefore going even more nuts, which would create havoc among the population. I mean, LOOK at the guy. He spent the time between the last movie and this one rotting on the bottom of the lake, and he certainly looks like it through this entire movie. Unfortunately, the filmmakers not only revealed the modesty of their budget through the lack of anything really interesting happening, they also displayed a massive lack of understanding of the geography of the city of New York. I've never even been there myself, but it seems like pretty much basic logic that they would not design the city so that the dirtiest slums had the finest waterfront property. Meaning, I doubt you could row up to New York from the ocean, right alongside the Statue of Liberty, and climb up onto land, finding yourself surrounded by endless alleyways full of things like gun-toting rapists and standing barrels of toxic waste. New York is a big city, and all cities throughout the world pretty much have to have things like this somewhere, but generally not right on the water and right next to major monuments. I happen to know, for example, that if you go to San Francisco, you won't find the crime-ridden slums right under the Golden Gate Bridge, and I doubt that you would find open barrels of toxic waste ANYWHERE. But anyway, they certainly find some room for effective comic relief (although notably less than other films in the series), my favorite example of which is the scene where Jason looks curiously at a picture of a hockey player on a billboard wearing exactly the same mask that he has on, a sort of self-realization that has since been overshadowed by the T-1000 pausing to look at a metallic mannequin in Terminator 2. I love that stuff, it gives even the most two-dimensional bad guys a sort of self-consciousness, so that they're not just mindless killing machines but have some semblance of actual thought in their heads, seeing and analyzing their surroundings and pausing when they see something that they don't understand. Makes the inhuman killers more human, you know? Speaking of which, there was also a scene that was really funny for much the same reason, and feel free to make fun of me for seeing it this way. There's a scene pretty near the end of the film where Jason is pursuing the few remaining kids through the streets of Manhattan, and he passes by some street punks hanging out and smoking on the sidewalk and listening to some ridiculous 80s music ('Livin' inna city ain't no big deal, livin' inna city ain't no big deal. If the drugs don't getcha then the hooka's will\u0085.' And so forth\u0085), and as Jason walks by, he kicks their boom-box across the sidewalk. Being tough gutterpunks, of course, they stand up and pull out their switchblades, informing Jason that he just dug his own grave. Jason's response is to turn and face them and lift up his mask so they can see his face. I liked that scene, because like the one above, it shows a self-consciousness. Jason KNOWS that he looks terrifying. He always has, and rotting on the bottom of the lake made it even worse. It also shows that he can deal with people in a way other than cutting them all up and still have it be pretty satisfying to the audience. The climax of the film is bogged down pretty badly by some heavily botched logic and another massive lack of understanding of the underbelly operations of a major city. First of all, none of the passersby up on the streets take a second look at this gigantic, wet, rotting man walking down the street with a hockey mask. I know New Yorkers can be cold and indifferent, but even THEY would not take something like THAT as normal. But even worse, as the kids escape into the underground sewage system (which does not run through wide walkways beneath the sidewalks in ANY city that doesn't want to smell like it's own waste), they run into a sewage worker who informs them that the sewers (in which they are currently standing) fill with toxic waste every night at midnight ('Exactly ten minutes from now!'), and is then killed by Jason before being able to show them how to get out. I won't get into the fact that there is no imaginable reason for any underground pipe system to fill with toxic waste every night at a certain time other than to create false suspense for a movie like this, although that is most of the reason that this climax falls so completely flat. We do get something for the kids to run away from and a time-limit for them to get out of the sewer, and we do get a glimpse of Jason's hideous face as he melts into the waste, but it is a completely contrived setting that has no basis in reality, which is the one thing that always makes horror films (or films of almost any genre, for that matter) more effective. Friday the 13th VIII, obviously, is not very concerned with that, which makes it one of the less interesting installments in the saga, although at least it takes place in a different setting so we have a reason to slap our foreheads other than because there is yet ANOTHER group of morons going up to Camp Crystal Lake to taunt the legend of Jason Voorhees.",
         "Before I started to watch horror movies last week I always used to read about them. Jason Takes Manhattan was always the most interesting one to me. Finally I watched it yesterday without seeing the other ones because I really wanted to see this one. I must say it wasn't bad. While the title is semi misleading given the fact that most of the film is on a boat I didn't mind that. One thing in this movie...it's so 80s it hurts. Not that that's bad but the music and hairstyles are extremely dated. But the 80s are cool so there isn't an issue there. When they finally get to Manhattan there are some cool parts like when Jason smashes through glass. For some reason the Manhattan bits reminded me of the first Ninja Turtles movie. Also(SEMI SPOILER)thank God the movie has the heart not to kill the dog. When you kill a person in the movie it's whatever but when you kill an animal it's much worse. So anyways I liked the movie but whatever you do...don't go into it expecting to have in all in Manhattan or you'll be let down.",
         "This is undoubtedly one of the worst film in the Friday the 13th series. It lacks horror, story and qualities of any kind. The fact that the film was released makes me sick. The film drags on a ferry with a bundle of bad acting characters which are all slaughtered off in terrible ways. Then when they finally reach Manhattan which is towards the end may I add, the plot barley even involves Jason and is another half an hour dragging on to complete the film. The film becomes even more cheesy and is not scary what so ever and completely ruins the film when Jason is seen by half of Manhattan chasing the two helpless victims because nobody seems to be doing anything to help them. If you think it could only get better, well you're wrong, as Jason goes to Hell is just as bad!",
         "I've seen my share of bad movies in my life, mostly from being such a big fan of MST3K for so long. But this movie really takes the cake. It is without a doubt the worst Friday the 13th, second only to Part V: A New Beginning. Not even the presence of the (somewhat) well-known Peter Mark Richman and the now-famous Jason himself, Kane Hodder, could make this film make any sense. The movie is flawed in many ways, one of the biggest of which involves Rennie Wickham's constant visions of Jason Voorhees as a young child. Often times she is touched by these visions and yet Jason is either with her at the time or is near her, which makes someone want to ask \"What is going on in this girl's head?\". The visions may have been caused by deep psychological trauma suffered from the events of the flashback seen towards the end where she almost drowns and encounters Jason as a young child. But that flashback is a primary example of how flawed this movie is in terms of the continuity of the series. It is determined in Part 2 that Jason did, in fact, not drown as a child but survived and spent the rest of his childhood in the woods, which eventually leads to him being the fully grown undead serial killer the fans have grown to love. Another major flaw is the ending, in which Jason is drowned in toxic waste. However, seconds before being doused with said chemicals, water shoots out of his mouth almost for no apparent reason. It may have been the intention of the writers to do this to remind the viewers that it would be the second time Jason has drowned in his life, but I highly doubt it. And then the end after Jason is killed, the audience is shown the body of a young boy, which is no doubt Jason Voorhees. This ending would indicate that Jason was always a boy but . . . something, maybe being reborn with a body of swamp algae and barnacles that the toxic waste disintegrated? Highly unlikely once again. And of course, there is the flaw of Jason's apparent ability to change places at the blink of an eye, in which he is seen in one place for one moment and then seems to move with lightning fast stealth in front of the characters almost like Freddy Krueger. How is it that someone in reality who walks slower than Michael Myers can move so quickly off camera, especially if he never seemed to be this quick in the previous movies? The only time we see Jason take a shortcut to get to his destination faster is towards the end when he's chasing Sean Robertson and Rennie Wickham through the tunnels. All of these flaws are the faults of the writers, all of whom may need to reconsider their paths and/or hire their own editors.",
         "Every movie series has its ups and downs. This was definitely Friday the 13th's \"down\" For some reason, this movie just wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, I liked it and all...just didn't have that thrill that the others had. It shouldn't be called \"Jason Takes Manhattan\". Should be something like \"Jason takes a cruise\" or something. Although Kane Hodder played a great Jason, the character of Jason in this movie was disproportional. His abilities and whatnot. Some of the characters were the worst in this movie, the acting was pretty bad. I do like some scenes however. But they didn't fully redeem this movie from the horrific outcome. I give this a 5/10, this is probably my least favorite of the series.",
         "My friend and I rented two movies, knowing that they were going to be bad; Jason X, and this, Friday the 13th 8. We watched Jason X first, and both agreed that it was pretty bad. And then we watched this..... Oh god this was horrible. To start, the concept is stupid, Jason going to Manhattan. Cities in New York are really over used in movies, no matter how good the movie may be. In the flashback at the beginning, of young Jason drowning, they COMPLETELY screwed up what his appearance is supposed to be. Jason was supposed to look like a bald, deformed child. In this, he has plenty of hair, and he looks like a normal little boy. Another thing, I do believe Jason SWIMS to that cruise thats headed towards Manhattan (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). Everyone who knows enough about Jason Voorhees and the Friday series should know that he can't swim, and that he's afraid of water. And even if I am wrong about that, why would they make him be on a boat, surrounded by water? And one incredibly stupid is when Jason is chasing those two people IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, Jason scares those kids by lifting up his mask. And finally, the final scene in the sewer, Jason's hockey mask comes off, and you get to see his face. AND THEY SCREW THAT UP TOO. Again, Jason is supposed to look deformed. In this, they make him look like a zombie in those cliché' zombie movies. I could go on all day about how bad this movie is. Don't rent it. I seriously regret renting it, even if you want to rent a bad movie to get a laugh about it. This is a horrible movie, and I'm never watching it again. The end.",
         "Renowned film critic Leonard Maltin calls \"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\" the highlight of the series. Of course Maltin rated virtually every other \"Friday\" film a dud, so that's not saying much. In any event, he's wrong. But while this eighth installment is comparatively inferior to most that preceded it, it's not as bad as reputed outside Maltin circles. \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" is one of those movies that's impossible to love unconditionally. There are simply too many flaws, from ridiculous plot elements (Jason can teleport???) and an uneven pace to a lack of chills and incompatible attempts at humor. Indeed this entry represents a bitter come-down after the absolutely stellar parts VI and VII. In many ways, \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" doesn't feel like part of the franchise. The Jason here isn't scary like we know he can be. His deadly moves, be it the electric guitar impaler or decapitatingly powerful right hook, seem contrived. Kane Hodder looks like a guy in a Jason suit rather than the real deal. Director Rob Hedden fell into the trap of gore for the sake of gore, but that's never been what \"Friday the 13th\" is all about. It's all in the build-up, and sometimes, even in low-budget '80s horror, less is more. With all of that said, \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" isn't a total loss. The mere sight of the rapidly decaying villain storming through the mean streets of the Big Apple is worth at least four stars. Aside from the change of scenery, the film offers a semi-compelling storyline or two. And the masked one does have his frightening moments, smashing through portholes and firing harpoons at horny teens. As usual, the climax -- this time a chase through the city and sewer -- is the highlight. For better or for worse, \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" marks the last true \"Friday the 13th.\" This was Paramount's last stab (pun intended) at things before selling the rights to New Line Cinema, which basically destroyed the series with absurd ideas like Jason switching bodies and rampaging through spaceships. Not great, but not godawful, this film carries limited appeal outside of fanboy circles.",
         "(Before seeing this movie)Uh oh, looks like mean IL' Jason Voorhees is off to slaughter more naughty teenagers. Wow this one's going to be predictable, but wait...He's in New York this time? Sweet! Voorhees is going to be running around hacking the fine citizens of this metropolis into something resembling a fine pate in no time. (After seeing the movie)...This thing should have been called \"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Sits on a Boat For the First 80 Minutes and Spends the Last 20 in New York\" or simply \"Jason on a Boat!\" or perhaps maybe even \"Avoid This Movie as if it Were Liquid Death with a Plague Chaser.\" I love bad movies, I don't know why, I just do. However, I cannot bring myself to enjoy such a worthless movie as this. I hated it, the first forty minutes of the movie I just wanted the damn boat to sink and kill everybody on board. Then Jason could walk on the bottom of the ocean, get to New York and give its loud-mouth citizens a taste of swamp justice. But no, instead they hand me, \"Jason Sits on a Boat with his Thumb up his Anus Praying Something Cool will happen Part I.\" Possibly the most misleading title ever. Don't see it unless you plan to get really, really wasted and cry like a wuss right after. This movie will eat your soul and laugh as you fade into oblivion. Spare yourselves and do not fall prey to my fate."
