         "Once again, we find \"Too Sweet\" struggling against his conscience, and the bad guys, to gain his freedom. After defeating his arch-rival, and gaining freedom: \"Too Sweet\" works himself into championship contention...he's reunited with his sister, who is married, and has a young son. As fate would have it...he must fight against the same man he defeated to end the first movie. Now, they each have risen in the rankings. You'll find the plot thin, the acting pitiful, and get a good laugh for nostalgia's sake.. You'll notice Mr.T, Ernie Hudson (the warden on \"Oz\"), and a few others...have your buddies over, break out the beer and enjoy. Its true entertainment value is how thinly veiled the plot and characters are. This movie, was BIG...back in the Blaxpo days. Essentially it rode the wave of the original. Leon Isaac had no talent, physique, or legitimacy as an actor. But , he did what most successful films do...run a sequel to milk the audiences thirst.",
         "(Zero Stars) You don't have to take my word for it, this movie got a \"Zero Star\" rating from Roger Ebert-His review can not be found anymore. This movie, was excruciatingly atrocious, in every sense of the word. It starts out unintentionally funny, with an obvious \"Star Wars\" opening rip-off, and more story holes then the body count in \"The Wild Bunch\" then quickly dwells into a most unpleasant experience-not that the first twenty minutes were, but this reaches new depths. It's even more, much more unpleasant than \"Cyborg\", which is another disaster. Next rambles on, and on, making the experience even more painful. The ending-or, endings (The film never seems to end) is so mind-bogging atrocious, in so many different, and subtle ways, it makes me cringe even to know there are people who produced this junk. This grade Z junk. Absolutely dreadful, in the extreme. This movie is extremely atrocious. This is the most hated movie, I have ever seen.",
         "I didn't think too much of the first \"Penitentiary\" movie, finding it a cheap and slow exercise. Though it must have made quite a bit of money, because a few years later this sequel came out. And it manages to be worse than the original in almost every way you can think of. The script is a mess - it has a meandering quality, as if director/screenwriter Jamaa Fanaka was making things up as he was going along. And it never makes any of the characters real enough to be believable. The only good things about the movie were that the production values were a step up from the original, and there is a (un?)intentionally funny \"Star Wars\" reference. If you must see one movie from this series, I recommend you skip forward and watch part 3, which is pure (and entertaining) insanity done with slickness.",
         "The only good thing I can say about PENITENTIARY II is that it's better than PENITENTIARY III, which was a soulless Cannon exercise redeemed only by the couple of really bizarre moments. In PEN II, the film is more down to earth, relaxed and \"real\" than Part 3. The film is still pretty much terrible but I like these junky \"grindhouse\" type of movies that they simply don't make anymore. The story doesn't make much sense, and by the time the second fight occurred, I completely lost track of what was going on. The last shot in the film reminded me of a Crumb comix. The funniest thing in this movie is the \"villain\" and his ho. The entire moment when they eat in bed is priceless!",
         "Penitentiary II (1982) is the second part of the Penitentiary trilogy. The first film is deals with an unlucky dude name Too Sweet (Leon Isaac Kennedy) who learns that the only way he can get out of prison if he boxes his way to the top. A few years later, Too Sweet is a boxing champion and living the good life. But his life is turned upside down (again) as he has to deal with an old nemesis that what's a little pay back for what happened to him in the first film. Can Too Sweet defeat his archenemy once again? Will he defend his title and win the biggest fight of his life? Why does Mr. T play himself in this film? Find out by watching Penitentiary II. Ernie Hudson co-stars as Half Dead and Rudy Ray Moore cameos as himself. Recommended for fans of low budget films."
