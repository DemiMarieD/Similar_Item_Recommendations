      "synopsis": "Mike Peters (Jon Favreau) is a struggling actor who left New York, and a girlfriend behind, to find success in L.A. The move caused his girlfriend of six years to split up with him six months earlier and left him feeling alone and heartbroken. In the opening scenes of the film, Mike talks about his situation with his friend Rob (Ron Livingston), another thespian from back east. Mike feels miserable about their conclusions. Afterwards, while on the phone, Mike is coaxed into an impromptu Las Vegas trip by his new best friend, and also actor, Trent (Vince Vaughn) to help Mike get over his ex. The trip starts out on a high note with excitement and anticipation but soon takes a turn for the worse when Mike crashes and burns at the casino. Soon after, the guys manage to meet some ladies and just when it seems as if though Mike can make some progress and salvage the trip, it all falls apart again and this time Trent goes down with him. On the ride home, Trent gets Mike to feel better about himself and to look at the positive side of things. Mike promises to try his best to move on. Now back in L.A., Mike and Rob get together for some golf and to talk shop. Later that night, Mike and Trent are getting ready to hit the Hollywood hills, at their actor friend Sue's (Patrick Van Horn) apartment. With the vibes feeling right and things going well, Mike and Rob meet up with Mike's pal Charles (Alex DÃ©sert), yet another starving actor, at a local bar where they admire the beautiful women. Soon afterward they rendezvous with the others and they all finally make it to a party where Mike makes an ill-fated attempt to get back into the game, while Trent gives the guys a lesson in how to handle the opposite sex. The guys agree to head to their favorite after hours spot and after watching Trent and Sue effortlessly meet some girls, Mike is clearly shown feeling lower than ever but not yet defeated. Trent and Sue convince Mike that he is in control so he finally makes his move like he's got nothing to lose and he actually meets Nikki (Brooke Langton) and gets her phone number. Success at last or so he hopes. The swingers leave the lounge and narrowly miss getting into a brawl in the parking lot caused by Sue's temper yet averted by Sue pulling a gun which no one else was aware was even a part of his attire. The group splits up but not before angry words are exchanged among friends. Mike is left feeling desolate once again. To make himself feel better, Mike decides to call Nikki but he blows any chance he has with her when he goes overboard in their \"conversation\". Now he feels as if he has truly hit bottom and he sits alone in his apartment, missing his ex more than ever and contemplating a move back to New York. Rob comes over to console him and, after some serious talk, he feels like it's time to get back in the saddle again. Mike meets up with the guys at Sue's, where he discovers that he has missed some changes in the group dynamic. That aside, apologies are exchanged, and the nightlife once again awaits them. The next stop is a Hollywood night club for swing night. The guys enter through a makeshift VIP entrance in a style that pays homage to Director/Writer/Producer Martin Scorsese. Once inside, the guys let the good times roll and Mike spots a beautiful woman whom he decides he wants to meet. He gathers all his courage and approaches her confidently. He finds himself in an actual interesting conversation with the young and single Lorraine (Heather Graham). They are soon swing dancing and the chemistry between them is incredible. The night ends well and Mike, Trent and Sue head to an afterhours meal to discuss the particulars. Mike finally appears to be on his way to moving on and feeling good about himself. The following morning Mike receives a phone call from his ex. She wants to talk about their state of affairs, but when Mike decides to answer another incoming call, he is greeted by Lorraine. He has to make an immediate decision as to which path he wants to go down and in a moment that solidifies his regained self-esteem, he puts his past behind him and chooses to take a chance on someone new. In the closing scene, Mike meets Trent for coffee and they enjoy one more good heart to heart while Trent is brought down to earth by a reminder that even when you've got it, you can't win 'em all, in an ending that suits the swingers perfectly before we leave them on another sunny L.A. day.",

         "Let me preface this review by saying that this is my favorite film of all time. I'm not saying it was the best, most artistic, original, or most innovative...but it is my favorite. It's a movie about a 20-something man getting over a nasty break-up, living in Los Angeles. Pretty simple stuff, but the honesty in the film is amazing. This film boasts the most realistic, and interesting depictions of male friendship I've ever seen. Some might simply pawn this movie off as a buddy flick, but it goes so much deeper than that. Mikey (Favreau) deals with insecurity, rejection, depression, an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy. Something almost everyone can relate to. And, as an audience member, you live and die with the poor guy. The supporting cast is very strong, popping in and out as the assortment of friends populating Mikey's social life. Each is trying, in his own way, to get their buddy out of his post-break up funk, which meet with varying degrees of success. Swingers is chock full of laugh-out-loud moments, and oft-quoted lines (\"Our baby's all grows up!\") that could very easily lead to repeated viewings of this masterpiece.",
         "I think a few of the readers who have commented on this film seem to be missing the point. While it can be said that this movie has no plot to speak of and no central point to it, my response is: so what? Not every movie is made to teach you how to live your life. Some of us can watch a movie simply for the pure enjoyment of listening to characters interact. Swingers does a better job of achieving this than the majority of movies ever made. Anybody can make Godzilla or Independence Day, but it takes a truly special movie to become a \"cult hit\" with nothing more at it's disposal than no-name actors (at the time) and catchy dialogue. This movie was the springboard for virtually every actor in it, with each going on to more well known parts. Ok, enough preaching, pure and simple this movie is great. Vince Vaughn's character is one of the most likable characters you'll see in a movie. Even if you have nothing in common with someone like him, you can't help but like him. He's hilarious, smooth, and a loyal friend, and he has some of the most quotable lines in the movie. Everyone else on this site has quoted it time and again, so no need for me to, but let's just say it's funny stuff. John Favreau's character, Mikey, makes you laugh while at the same time wanting to slap him for being so stupid. There's so many funny scenes in this movie, I can't even begin to describe them. But the best by far always involve Vaughn, and the part where he's in the trailer describing his experience auditioning for a pilot is classic. You know he's feeding the girls a line the whole time, but it's so convincing and everyone is so in awe of him, it's hysterical. And when Mikey tries to act cool in front of the waitresses they meet, and fails to do so, only to see Trent tell them he's a producer and watch them swoon, I can't see how people don't find that funny. Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and go rent it. The buildup offered on this site is only a fraction of what you'll actually get out of watching it. 10+/10",
         "I saw that someone commented this is the perfect guy movie. I'd like to add that it's not just for guys. The characters in it are just as easy to relate to for girls. If you think girls don't pathetically chase after guys the same way the men of Swingers were going after girls, you need to get out more.(Not meant to be an insult.) My favorite character in it (though I love them all) is Rob. His insecurity is cute, but of course he's also a loyal friend. You can't beat that. And I love the goofy quote. \"Hi, Mom. I'm goofy. Send more money.\" That's great! This is one of those movies that I love to watch over and over again. I will never get sick of it. Plus my husband (then boyfriend) introduced me to it so of course I love it. He even picked me up from my classes once by yelling, \"Hey, do you know where all the high school girls hang out??\" from across the street. This movie was incredibly funny and deserves a lot more praise than it gets.",
         "Money! Having lived the life of Mike, this movie hits home. No gig, no girl...no self esteem... Hangin with the boys. Who hasn't been there? A virtual plethora of one liners and quotes for guys (this is definitely a guy flick) in their 20's and 30's. Who hasn't left a relationship only to wallow in guilt and self doubt. Especially when you find out the ex is seeing someone else. Add to this the inability to land a decent paying gig, living alone in an unfamiliar town, and having bunch of condescending clowns as your support group and its no wonder that poor Mike was about to return to Queens with his tail between his legs. The best part of this film is the self transformation of Mike from the pitiful whiner holed up in his apartment for days after Sue tells him what a loser he is, to the Bear spotting the Bunny (literally) from the other side of the bar. Though Mike is constantly hearing and taking advise from his posse...ultimately, it is himself who shows that through his own experiences (ball room dance lessons with the ex) and his own strengths of honesty, charm and charisma that he proves he is indeed, money, and lands him the beautiful baby Lorraine. \"It is so on\" as the hilarious Trent (scene stealer Vince Vaughn) first spots the pensive conversation between Mike and Lorraine. (Heather Graham) The looks on Trent's and Sue's faces are priceless as they spy Mike and his beautiful baby working the dance floor to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's \"Go Daddy O\". I don't think I have ever seen Ms Graham look better that she does here... \"It didn't occur to me\" Mike replies to Trent in the final scene when asked why he didn't call the ex back. Amazing what a little confidence (and a dance with a hot blonde) can do for guy! This is a hilarious movie about real guys (you have known somebody like every character in this film!) set against the surreal back drop of the then-hip LA swing scene in the mid 90's doing what they do best....10 out of 10",
         "Before watching \"Swingers,\" I saw Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn paired off in \"Made.\" Now, I didn't like \"Made\" all that much, but that didn't lower my expectations when watching \"Swingers.\" I already knew the two actors had a great chemistry and as long as the script is well-written, they can really go places. \"Swingers\" is a thoroughly original, wonderfully written comedy that's filled with big laughs. Favreau and Vaughn's characters are like polar opposites, and it's hilarious to watch them argue. The rest of the actors are also good (I think the black guy is the blind character from \"Becker\"--I could be wrong), but Vince Vaughn steals the show as the smooth-talking Trent. We all have friends like Trent. Some of us aspire to be like Trent. Some of us are Trent. I admit, I would compare myself more to Favreau's character--the more reserved, sensitive type. But the great thing about a film like this is it's down to earth. It's about everyday people in everyday situations, and I guarantee many of us can relate to the characters in \"Swingers\" in one way or another, just like how many of us relate to the characters on \"Seinfeld.\" This isn't a plot-driven film, so you can call this a movie about nothing. It's simply about a group of studs on the prowl, hitting the clubs and casinos, and sharing their philosophies on sex and dating. There are several films that tried to replicate this format and failed (\"Whipped\" comes to mind). If you're in the mood to laugh hysterically and be wildly entertained, \"Swingers\" is the movie for you. About my only criticisms would be a few lame attempts to be stylish. Come on, would 5 guys really drive in their own cars and follow each other all the way without anyone cutting them off? My score: 8 (out of 10)",
         "This is a hilarious film about nobodies claiming to be bigger than they ever will be! Doug Liman showed much promise and I'm more than sure that one day he will continue to make bigger budget films (Bourne Identity) Careers should also be good for the great Jon Favreau who is just a fantastically witty writer, Vince Vaughn who should get a headlining film and Ron Livingston who is still performing good roles. I love the script in this film, the language is unique and the scenarios are superb... the sad fact is that there are hundreds of guys like Trent, Mike, Rob & Sue (played by Patrick Van Horn) I urge everybody to watch this even though it might not be there cup of tea! 9/10",
         "This film could prove that nice guys \"don't\" finish last. A truly great and funny movie. The movie is basically about getting a nightlife, friendship and picking up girls. The movie centers on Mike (Jon Favreau). A very brave but not cocky young man who constantly dwells on his ex-girlfriend and unsuccessfully attempts to rekindle his love life. Trent (Vince Vaughn) is always there to give him encouragement and inspiration. In someways Trent is the star of this movie. He has a strong screen presence and is extremely funny. This movie teaches us to always double down on an eleven in black jack and how many days to wait before you call the girl for the first time. The greatest scene in this movie has to be when Trent and Sue are talking to Mike in the lounge and are trying to encourage Mike to ask a girl at the bar for her phone number. The \"big bad bear and little bunny\" analogy they use is hilarious. You have to feel happy for Mike when he meets Lorraine (Heather Graham) at the end of the movie. We see Trent and Sue watching their buddy in amazement but we know that they are truly proud of him. Mike really was money and he didn't even know it.",
         "I chanced upon Swigers one evening after reading an article on writer/star Jon Favreau, and trying to figure out which character he played in Friends (it's Pete Becker by the way); don't you love it when you uncover a gem. From the opening credits, set to Dean Martin crooning \"You're Nobody Until Somebody Loves You\", I knew that this film was the very personification of cool, spawning one of the coolest characters in any film...ever, that being Trent Walker played by Vince Vaughn, with a swinging soundtrack and a real sense of fun which you don't often get in mainstream Hollywood; and this film is effortless in a way which Tarantino could only dream about. The story centres around Favreau's loser-in-love Mikey, trying to make a living as an actor in L.A after leaving his long-term girlfriend behind in New York. His best buddy, Trent, tries incessantly to get Mikey back 'into the game' so to speak; cue a trawl around L.A's hippest night-spots, some hilarious insight into dating rituals (when is it cool to call? 2 days?), and a trip to Las Vegas in which Trent tries to 'pull a Fredo' (bedding cocktail waitresses two at a time). The central duo are ably supported by a cast of lovable rogues, all intent on getting laid. Doug Liman directs in a laid-back manner, befitting of the film, and Favreau's script (based on Vaughn and himself) is full of witty insights and in-jokes, as well as enough movie references to keep everyone happy. Although the characters are almost impossibly cool, they never appear obnoxious due to the over-riding sense that they are just a bunch of lovable losers trying to con their way into the beds of L.A's female population; sometimes succeeding, sometimes not, and there is a certain sweetness added by Favreau's predicament. The pay-off is cool, Favreau finally 'getting digits' and we are left with a role-reversal between the two main protagonists as Trent makes a fool of himself with a woman in the closing scene. Altogether a classy, breezy, often hilarious film, a certain cult classic, and a fine addition to the date movie genre.",
         "\"The point is, Mike, that it all depends on how you look at it.\" Swingers is the quintessential guy movie. Not to say that a woman won't enjoy it, or that it's a stereotypical collection of all the things that men are supposed to love in movies, like a non-stop testosterone-fueled orgy of naked women, explosions, and violence.Â  Nope, Swingers is the quintessential guy movie because almost every guy can relate to at least part of it at some time during his life. The uncertainty about your career, the lingering pain of losing a girlfriend you truly loved, the camaraderie (and annoyances) of your friends, the frustrating world of dating and the games and \"rules\" that come along with it, and the feeling of that moment when you finally realize that your life can go on without that other person it revolved around so long. The story focuses on Mike (Jon Favreau), an aspiring comedian in Los Angeles who has recently gone through a break-up with his long-term girlfriend back east, and his group of friends. Most of whom try to help Mike get over his break-up by meeting women in and around L.A. and Las Vegas. Especially his two best friends, ladies man Trent (Vince Vaughn) and Rob (Ron Livingston) Â Most of the movie follows the group on their nightly romps through the city, or Mike as he struggles with the loss of the relationship that he was very much invested in. I enjoyed the casual conversations the guys had about women, video games, their job efforts, and other things. Swingers really nailed the dynamics of how guys act with each other. It's also pretty funny, though it's not a total comedy by any means. A lot of the humor derives from Mike's painful attempts to talk to women, after six long years off the market. There's a really hysterical sequence about Mike and a woman's answering machine later in the movie that will have you howling.Â  I got the sense that Swingers is the kind of movie that holds up well after repeated viewings, and maybe even gets better. It's not amazing, or anything like that, but it is hard to imagine anyone (especially guys aged 20-29) not appreciating it.",
         "Upon hearing about this movie from friends, I was told that it was \"money\". They were right. This is \"so money and they don't even know it.\" Entertaining comedy about letting go, and finding new romance and who your real friends are. Enough one-liners to quote for years, friends still quote it today! Nothing but beautiful babies, and a great upbeat soundtrack to get you dancing!"
