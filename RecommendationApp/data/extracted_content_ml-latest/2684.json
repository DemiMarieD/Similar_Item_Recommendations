         "This small budget independent film was delightfully charming to say the least. It makes you yearn for films of yester-year. The almost unknown cast ensemble was spectacular. The sets were magical and so was the presentation. The feature star actor Billy Zane (Titanic and The Phantom) who can be a bit theatrical at times was well subdued just as the story prescribed. If you like old-fashion romantic comedies you can watch with your family then this little film is a must have! 'IF' you can locate this little gem of a film I suggest you do!",
         "George Putter (Billy Zane) lives in a small community in Canada, where he resides in a lovely mansion. After all, his family has operated a glorified general store in the village for decades and, when his father died, he was the heir apparent. However, George is sometimes more interested in his own inventions and sculptures than he is in the store. One day, a wealthy entrepreneur, Vernon Fry (Patrick Bergen) comes to Putterton with the intent of opening a large department store that would most certainly result in the closure of the smaller establishments. The village council runs him out of town on a rail. Yet, when a new government taxman, er, taxlady, Caroline (Valerie Valois) arrives from Montreal, everyone is shaking in their boots, for the \"books\" have been \"cooked\" for quite some time. Will the village's businesses go under anyway? Why not have George try to woo the lovely Caroline and get her mind off the ledgers? This is a wonderful, romantic little film from that Maple Leaf country in the great snowy north. It has a nice but unknown cast, except for Zane and Bergin. Anyone who saw their turns, respectively, in Dead Calm or Sleeping with the Enemy, will be surprised to see that they can handle light comedy, too, in a charming way. The look of the film is most lovely, with knockout Canadian scenery, sweet costumes, and beautiful camera work. Then, too, the story and script are quite humorous and engaging. Therefore, all fans of romantic comedy or the unknown gems of cinema should head immediately to K-Mart, for that is where I plucked out this little wonder for a flat $2.50, under a slightly different title.",
         "I'm not sure why I requested this title from Netflix. It had been on my list of movies for a year or two, maybe I got it mixed up with a different one, not sure. Anyway I like Billy Zane, he always does a good job, and he comes through here. But the premise is pretty silly and most of the situations and dialog are pretty silly. Anyway, Billy Zane is George Putter, the youngest in a very long like of Putters who established the quaint Canadian town in the 1800s. It happened to be on a February 29th, so \"Founder's Day\" is celebrated every 4 years, only on leap years. A storm comes, lightning strikes, and in an instant the three remaining elder Putters are gone. One of the relatives was the town tax inspector, so a new one is sent in, a pretty lady. But Putterville has been hiding a serious secret ... no one and no business has paid any tax for the past 50 years. Now they were in danger of being exposed by this new tax inspector, owing lots of back taxes and maybe some jail time. So it is up to young George, who would rather be in his art workshop making sculptures, to save Putterville. A plan is hatched to have him romance the new lady and get her attention off the books, which they are trying to hide. A pertinent side story has a wealthy investor in town to buy them up and bring in \"modern\" businesses. When he finds out about the tax situation he tries to use that as leverage. Oh, and by the way, some of the old, deceased Putters show up to give George advice, only seen and heard by George. SPOILERS: In examining an old note he thinks to look at an old portrait salvaged from a fire years earlier, brushing off the soot reads something. It turns out that the governor of the region had signed a document making Putterville a religious community, and all the residents Putterites, and thus exempt from taxes. Plus George gets the lady."
