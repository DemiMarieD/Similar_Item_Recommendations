         "This is yet another of those cases where Anglosaxon audiences might be tempted to think that it reenforces their prejudice that German humour is a no-show. The problem can be described in one word: subtitles. I (a native German speaker) watched the UK release which is the original German version with English subtitles. The dialogue of this film is very funny and sharp; it is quite different from contemporary funny English dialogue which usually goes for funny one-liners, it has more in common with the humour you find in Oscar Wilde, for example in The Importance of Being Earnest. In other words, the characters are constantly trying to (literally) outwit each other whilst keeping the conversation afloat. This kind of dialogue is quite fashionable in certain parts of German culture, but at least in Britain it has become fairly rare. Consequently, the translators had a difficult job on their hands. Occasionally my eyes wandered towards the subtitles to see what the translators did with the latest banter - and I was appalled with what I found. Yes, the translation was factually accurate, i.e. the content of what was said was accurately translated, but all the wit, the sharpness, the humour had gone. As already mentioned, this was a difficult translation job, but the translators did not try hard enough.",
         "This is gem of a movie which does not lose any of its wit and charm with the passage of time. The fast pace and irreverence to social institutions kept us howling until our sides ached. Don't misunderstand me, however; the plot of one mans journey to his sexuality is pursued with fever right up to its hilarious climax! I would say that anyone of any sexual orientation with a sense of humor should watch this one with a friend or lover or both!",
         "`Maybe, Maybe Not' is one of the most odd movies I've ever seen. I liked it. I think I liked it because it is so completely different than all the American movies I'm used to seeing. In the beginning, the main character, Axel, decides to randomly have sex with some girl in the bathroom of his workplace. A woman in the next stall recognizes the key chain that dropped from one of the fornicating couple's clothes. She peeks over the stall to find her boyfriend of three years mindlessly humping another woman. She kicks him out of their apartment and throughout the rest of the movie he struggles with where to live. Initially he calls old girlfriends who all readily turn him away. Then he ends up at a `men's group' with a lot of gay guys. After that, he gets drunk at a party and goes home to sleep at one of their houses. This is when the gender preference battle begins. A lot of stereotypes were defied in this movie and I found that extremely refreshing. For example, it is commonly thought in American society that gay men are promiscuous, however in this movie, no homosexual sex is shown. There is one man-to-man kiss in the club and in another scene homosexual activity is inferred while watching slides but not directly shown on the screen. There are, however, two comparatively graphic heterosexual scenes. Another stereotype defied was the `effeminate gay men' stereotype. The main gay character, Norbert, didn't act effeminate at all, not even in drag. My favorite part of the movie however perpetuated and made fun of an existing stereotype - the stupid Stallone-loving straight guy. The guys in the movie theater were very intriguing. I thought they added welcome comic relief to an otherwise tense and dark movie.",
         "I saw this film in Germany when it came out as I was living there at the time. It was one of the funniest films I ever saw. Some years later I got a subtitled copy back in England and was shocked at how unfunny it was when translated. Which goes to show that humour often only works in the language it was created in. That said, it is still a very unstylised view of culture clashes and a study of how far people are prepared to go when they aren't getting any sex. No one gets what they want by the end: the gay man doesn't get his straight friend; the straight man doesn't get his free-love lifestyle; the straight woman doesn't get her angry singledom. I guess the moral is that you can take the human out of their sexuality, but you can't take the sexuality out of the human. Trite, but it reflects the title of the film, referring to a proverbial fish out of water.",
         "Ok where to start.. Well I hate American movies, and when they make comedies there's no soul to it, merely funny events which happen to be funny only for Americans. But this movie has its deep side too, like most European movies. Norbert's \"rough\" boyfriend, the incident with Axel and his former classmate, and the rough boyfriend doing the girl in the bathtub while Axel stands frozen like a fly.. That scene was absolutely priceless. As for the casting, Katja Riemann is not only beautiful as a goddess, she's also an awesome actress. It's so surprising that she doesn't have the fame she deserves. Or maybe not, considering how many copies of DVD's boring Hollywood movies sell... Each time the word \"gay\" comes up in this movie, her gestures and facial expressions are outstandingly flawless. Even if you start watching the movie after the 40th minute and start from a scene with that word, you'd perfectly understand she's sick of homosexuality. Joachim Krol and Til Schweiger are also performing great here. I actually thought Joachim Krol was gay in real life after watching the movie. Well I don't have any evidence about his sexuality, but chances are he's not. My German is quite rusty and I still loved this movie. I'm sure I would like it even more if I understood the dialogues perfectly. So go and watch this movie, and shoot me if you don't like it. A little note, the main characters of this movie can be classified as eye candy. Katja Riemann is beautiful, and Til Schweiger is handsome. And with their acting skills, the movie becomes a delicious pastime.",

         "Based on the work of Ralf König -- the king (no pun intended) of the Teutonic queer comic strip -- Wortmann has made a film about the vicissitudes of coming out. Hand in hand, these two men from the country of \"poets and thinkers\" dare utter the words: \"we are German, we are funny, and we are not ashamed!\" In case you missed Wortmann's \"Kleine Haie\" (1992) -- a road film about three young men coming to grips with their thespianism -- here's proof that comedy is not merely a genre inflicted unilaterally by Hollywood on the rest of the world. Although this film does make concessions in order to be more palatable to its hetero viewership, it is clearly head-and-shoulders above recent Hollywood forays into the queer-exploitation venue such as the abysmal \"In&Out\" featuring Kevin Kline. After Fassbinder and Wenders it now looks like Germany has a commercially viable director with something worthwhile to say!",
         "This film is about a man's life turning upside down after spending the night in a gay man's house. This film is so funny! The acting is great, the two lead characters, Axel and Norbert are outstanding. Axel is a man who cannot say no to temptation. Norbert, is a secret admirer of Axel. He is cute and hilarious. Axel's wife, Doro, accidentally discovers her husband befriending Norbert. One coincidence after another, she becomes convinced of her husband's homosexuality. The plot is also very good. Though I can only catch German isolated phrases here and there, I still find the film entertaining. I laughed out loud many times. The sets are also decorated nicely, each of the apartments are set up so that they really feel like a home sweet home. Apart from being entertaining, it also promotes tolerance and diversity.",
         "I saw this movie a few months ago with my German class, and we were rolling on the floors. At first American audiences might be a little \"on edge\" when they hear about what the guy does, where he stays, and that he has no idea about the people he is staying with in the beginning. But after getting into it, you see that what he goes through is just so funny, and you can't believe that he didn't see it coming. Plus, the Bull Power is all the more reason to go see, or rent, the movie. I mean I can't believe that they didn't come up with this type of stuff in the U.S. I know a lot of people who would go out and buy it right now if they had the chance. My friends and I now have a fun time talking/joking with our teacher about the movie, and we randomly bring Red Bull energy drinks to class, just to make him laugh. It's a great movie, and everyone should see it. I loved it.",
         "\"Der bewegte Mann\" is maybe director and writer Sönke Wortmann's big breakthrough movie, although \"Kleine Haie\" was a success as well. It is based on the comics by Ralf König and won big at the German Film Awards 20 years ago: Feature Film, Direction and lead actor for Joachim Król. Maybe he got it over Schweiger as he played the much more likable character and for the epic wardrobe scene of course. For Riemann and Król, it was also the big breakthrough although the latter had been nominated previously already. And the biggest breakthrough, it must have been for Til Schweiger, under 30 and only known to Lindenstraße audiences at that point. The only reason Rufus Beck (Waltraud) or Armin Rohde did not win in the supporting category was probably as it did not exist. The movie has lots of dirty humor, some of it obvious, some of it not, for example if his offer still \"stands\". And there is other quotes, for example about sleeping at his place that night \"im Ernst or im Bett\". It's pretty impossible to translate accurately. Anyway, there are drag queens and there are absolutely no taboos in terms of talk about male and female sexuality. And we get to see the two protagonists' naked butts. Schweiger plays a hetero male who just lost his girlfriend and dives into the gay scene more and more. He has nothing going on with them of course, but they somehow see him as an object of desire. What I did not like was that the gays were displayed somewhat simple and dumb as they were obviously not realizing (or did not want to realized) that Schweiger's character wasn't even remotely interested. Of course, right before they split, he still managed to get his girlfriend pregnant. My favorite comedic parts were how she always enters when he seems in dubious homoerotic situations. Occasionally, I found it confusing if Schweiger's character wasn't actually gay as the film sometimes tried to make us think that way, but then randomly another woman entered the picture and the love life of Schweiger's character. Anyway, as a whole, I recommend watching this movie, especially if you are interested in German cinema. I am not sure if it was good enough to deserved all the accolades it got, but it is a fairly decent film and it was also a huge commercial success being among the three most lucrative films that year in Germany together with classics like \"Forrest Gump\" and \"The Lion King\". Quality-wise, I have to say, however, it is not on par with these two."

         "Axel, a handsome young guy is always on the hunt for women although he already has a girlfriend, Doro. One day he is caught in the act with another woman by Doro and she quits the relationship and throws him out of her apartment. Seeking for a new home, Axel is introduced to Walter, a homosexual, who finds Axel quite attractive. Walter takes Axel to a gay party where they meet Norbert, who has a big apartment and is more than willing to let Axel stay for a while because he thinks he can seduce him. Meanwhile, Doro finds out that she is pregnant from Axel and now she tries to get him back, not knowing that he lives among homosexuals now. This gives room for a lot of funny incidents between the gay world and the straight world. But will Doro get Axel back or will he stay with Norbert instead?",
         "Axel Feldmann (Til Schweiger), a very handsome but unfaithful young man, is caught in the act by his girlfriend Doro (Katja Riemann). She immediately breaks up with him and makes him move out of her apartment. After unsuccessfully seeking a place to stay with one of his former affairs, he gets to sleep at Günter's (Horst D. Scheel) for one night. Günter hosts a mens support group at his home to which Walter (Rufus Beck) has been invited to provide his view on things as a gay man, which he accepted to make fun of the group. As Axel is very good looking, Walter invites him to stay with him, which Axel refuses in the first place. But after another day of inconclusive search, he accepts. Walter takes him to a gay mens party at which Axel gets very drunk and yells at Walter that he only wants to seduce him. He decides to leave with Walters friend Norbert (Joachim Król), who keeps on having naive relationships with guys that only exploit his good faith. Meanwhile Doro finds out that she is pregnant by Axel and tries to find him. Axel and Norbert drive to Doros apartment to get his stuff, while Doro's on manhunt. The two men look at old photo slides, one of them showing Axel in a sexy pose. Norbert undresses without him noting it, when Doro arrives back home, so he has to hide in the wardrobe. Doro finds him and is very confused about Axel having a naked man hidden. However she tells him about her pregnancy and resumes her relationship.",
