It's an interesting idea acted well by very good actors (a lot of people dismiss Marlon Brando's work here, but I don't think it's that bad, honestly). If anything, the problem here is the movie doesn't know where to go after it's decent start.",

            "content": "**He who says every woman is a mystery to be solved.**\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest films for Johnny Depp and very surprising. Thematically, the film is for the grown ups, but well made without too much sexual exploit. That means you can comfortably sit and watch with your family. This is not actually about Don Juan, but kind of 'The Fall'. I mean the flashback reveals everything and remains as a mystery.\r\n\r\nThe story follows a man who himself declares the real Don Juan DeMarco, the greatest lover of the world. So he ends in a psychiatric centre for the treatment after trying to commit suicide. A doctor who is on the verge to retire set to treat him and when the DeMarco narrates his life story, the doctor too inspires to reinstate his romantic life. The remaining narration tells how they work out to solve the issue once for all.\r\n\r\nNot a masterpiece, but kind of interesting drama, particularly for how the film characters were drawn. And the story was built cleverly, till the final scene by giving out the viewers a positive message that worth living life to love and to be loved. So if you opt it for the title, not a bad choice, since the theme remains about the love, even the person you are looking for is not present. More like it is a metaphor, when it comes to the real Don Juan and the one in this film. Like people say god is everywhere, the love is as well and so the version/personality of Don Juan in every person.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp was so good, an ideal person to play the title role. Marlon Brando was too great, in a simple way. The rest of the cast was not bad, but the entire film focused on these two than anybody else. It's been nearly 25 years since it came out, but I feel a remake would be not a bad idea with changes in the script. Todays writer and directors are clever at doing that, but it should come from a big banner with big names. Maybe Johnny Deep to play the doctor in the modern version. I hope some filmmakers read this and consider that. Meanwhile, it is a worthy film, so it a try.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

         "I loved this movie. Within five minutes I was smiling and didn't break stride for the entire performance. Depp is strong in this role and very convincing as the world's greatest lover. Marlon Brando is funny and witty and is well supported by Faye Dunaway in the marital relationship of a couple heading for retirement and the best times of their lives. Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of all time. His performance is true and expressive and I just love his smile. I compare this performance to that of his character of Jack Sparrow in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\". I have no problem, whatsoever, recommending this movie to everyone.",
         "This is really an example of how a romantic comedy should be and how fantastic a romantic comedy can be. Intelligent, witty and great fun. It gives its audience respect by delivering a clever story with good actors and great lines. The story is quite absurd and so is the duo in it - Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. But this is just a good thing. Hollywood usually thinks its audience is filled with morons when making romantic comedies, but this is not so. There are still a few of us out here who enjoy the combination of intelligence, elegance and romance. This film delivers on all counts. Love is a simple enough ingredient for a film. This film knows how to use it and the result is wonderful.",
         "Unless you understand these 4 secrets, you will miss what the film is all about: 1. The film is NOT about Don Juan ! 2. The film tells us how to rekindle love in our lives, even if we are old and gray-haired. This is so very important!! 3. If we do not have a good dose of fantasy, of rich imagination, of beautiful dreams in our lives, then we will become 'burned out' by the harsh boredom of reality-as-we-perceive it. We are also challenged by the question \"What really is real?\" 4. If we have too much fantasy and not enough reality, then we cannot cope with the rest of the world. Also, society will not be able to cope with us and we will be isolated, perhaps in a mental institution or at least in our own twisted world. Oh - did I say that this film is not about Don Juan? Well, in a sense, I lied. It is and it is not. See the film and think about it. Superbly well acted by Johnny Depp, Marlon Brando, and Fay Dunaway (what an incredible beauty even at her age!). An amazing script and a very original story. Unless you understand the meanings above, or if you have a cold heart, you'll probably rate it a 5 or 6. I give it a 9 out of 10!!",
         "Psychologist Dr Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando) is called upon to negotiate a man down from the top of a tall building - a man claiming to be the great Latin lover Don Juan de Marco (Johnny Depp). Although Mickler is about to retire, he agrees to take Mr de Marco on, and delve into his mind and past. What he didn't count on was that Don Juan is starting to make him feel like HE'S missing something... The lives of Brando and Dunaway interact with their roles in the film - as oldies in need of rejuvenation by the young sex god. They were both sex symbols in their youth - Brando, till about the age of 60, was a real life Don Juan - he really HAS probably slept with over a thousand women. So if you know this it brings an interesting layer to the movie. It is a great journey which calls up all the great noble romances of the past in a tongue in cheek manner, with a love of stories, of fantasy, of women. I wouldn't hesitate to call it the most romantic movie ever made. If there was one flick you had to put on to set the right mood between you and a girl, this would be it. Looking at Johnny Depp might also help her in that regard. Its also a great fun family movie - which is a delicate balance to strike. 4/5 Disclaimer: there are about two sex scenes, which, though very discreetly and beautifully shot, featuring no vital organs, may be inappropriate for littlies, if you wish to shield them thus.",
         "A superb story where patient helps heal the doctor. In this case by spreading a bit of his romantic affliction. When one is so utterly convincing in their fantasy, it can become charming and attractive. If you have one ounce of the whimsical in your soul, who can't help but be drawn in. A story so well written and acted by all involved, it has to get a perfect 10.",
         "A witty and original story with a real sense of character. I was compelled by the mysteries of Don Juan before gradually understanding that the question I had been asking myself - whether Depp is a slightly insane guy from Phoenix, or the world's greatest lover of 1502+1 women - is irrelevant. His story, whether fact or fiction, is a highly effective feel-good fable that brings across a whole new concept of the meaning of passion -- while not attempting to take itself too seriously. Equally enjoyable is psychiatrist Brando's transformation from mid life crisis-ridden man to great Hispanic lover. Hilarious, thought-provoking and romantic in equal measure, this film will make you hum latino melodies for days to come, and is perhaps the ultimate date movie for those less fortunate than the Don.",
         "I want to live in Don Juan's world. Johnny Depp at 32(?) is quite believable as a 19 year old. He is also even more sexy than usual. I love him as Don Juan, but I think the most touching scene is when he is being interviewed by the judge and is \"just a kid\" and admitting to his real story. I cried when Marlon Brando asks Faye Dunaway what she wants to do and she says \"I thought you'd never ask.\" I missed these characters after the movie was over. I could watch it over and over.",
         "I recently re-watched this film with some friends and found myself, yet again, swept away by it's enchantment, romance, and live of life. In talking about it afterwards, I was struck by how well this film serves to reflect the romantic state of our souls. Quite simply, watch the film and, at the end, notice how you feel the about the character of Don Juan DeMarco. Was he a sad, lonely youth who invented a rich, romantic fantasy world for himself that became so appealing and rejuvenating to his psychiatrist that in the end they fly off to Mexico to re-live that fantasy world under his benevolent supervision? Or was he Don Juan DeMarco relating his adventures to Dr Mickler who becomes transformed by his tales of life and romance and is convinced of who Don Juan DeMarco is so that, in the end, they rehearse a story believable for the staff of the mental hospital that would set Don Juan free to fly off and reunite with his beloved Dona Anna? The film supports both interpretations. Ponder deeply which one you *really* believe and it will reveal the state of your romantic soul.",
         "This movie is a must, if you have even one romantic bone in your body. Depp is perfect as the lead, and I have never enjoyed Brando and Dunaway more. This movie is unique in my movie-going experience, as the entire audience applauded when it was over, which doesn't happen in NYC theatres too often.",
         "Wholly different the usual fare Hollyood dished up in the nineties, DON JUAN DEMARCO is charming and disarming. The screenplay seems lovingly crafted around the two stars, Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. They share scenes of relating, discovery and moving, personal respect. Mr. Brando shows easily, why he is still one of America's leading thespians. Faye Dunaway as his wife, is marvellous beyond words. The interplay between these three characters is a spirit lifting tour de force, that will leave you holding hands long after the screen has gone dark."

         "Dr Jack Mickler, a psychiatrist, is only 10 days away from his retirement. A week before he is due to leave, he encounters a young man who attempts suicide- would be a pretty straightforward case except the young man claims to be Don Juan, the fabled Spanish nobleman and world renowned seducer/lover of woman. Despite original hostility from his coworkers Jack manages to persuade his associates to put the boy in his care for 10 days after which the boy will undergo an evaluation to be either released from psychiatric care or sent to a mental institution. However, as the 10 days progresses Dr Mickler and the other staff become gradually drawn into to the young man's exotic world of love, passion and pleasure as he recounts his story to them. Whilst doing so the man's philosophies and zeal for life and love begins to revive Dr MIckler's somewhat passionless relationship with his wife, Marilyn as well as challenging his own views and ethics to the point where both he and the audience begin to question: could this young man truly be Don Juan?",
         "A young man (who is the legendary Don Juan?), comes to New York in search of his lost love. Feeling like he has nothing to live for, he attempts to commit suicide from atop a billboard. Dr. Mickler is a soon retiring psychiatrist who helps Don Juan, come to his senses. He brings the costumed boy to the psychiatric hospital , in hopes of helping Don Juan find his identity. The doctor works with him for ten days, in which Don tells his life story. Mickler begins to believe that the young man is truly Don Juan, but the rest of the staff doesn't agree. The doctor knows that the only way out for Don Juan, is to pretend he's an average boy whose fantasy got the best of him.",
         "A well-respected psychiatrist has a run-in with a young man who thinks he is Don Juan--or is he really? The Don Juan becomes his patient, and as the days pass, the psychiatrist starts to see that perhaps just because each person has his/her own reality doesn't mean they're crazy. \"Don Juan\", through his story-telling of his past, instills the psychiatrist with a new fire for life and love, changing his life.",
         "Psychiatrist Jack Mickler dissuades a would-be suicide; the 21-year old, costumed like Zorro and claiming he's Don Juan, is held for a ten-day review in a mental institution. Mickler, about to retire, insists on doing the evaluation, conducting it without medicating the youth. \"Don Juan\" tells his story - birth in Mexico, the death of his father, a year in a harem, then finding true love (and being rejected) on a remote island. Listening enlivens Mickler's relationship with his own wife. As the ten days tick down and pressure mounts on Mickler to support the youth's indefinite confinement, finding reality within the romantic imagination becomes Jack's final professional challenge.",
