         "This movie should be shown to every White person over the age of 16! The reason I say that is because it tells the cold, hard truth of what Blacks had to go through back in the 60's and it's not sugarcoated at all. It's not being said to make people feel guilty over something that they probably never took part in, but to educate people in what most public school systems DON'T teach about. As someone of primarily Native American descent who considers themselves pretty educated about Black history, I myself was very shocked and saddened at the brutality that Black Americans had to face (and still do at times). A picture (or movie) is worth a thousand words. This movie would be educational to everyone who views it. I would definitely recommend this movie to others.",
         "I saw this film by chance, was flipping through the movie channels one day and the description of it appealed to me. Goldberg is absolutely superb in this powerful film showing what it was like for black people at that time in Montgomery, Alabama. A good lesson to young people, or any person that does not fully know what black people had to put up with.",
         "I forget when I saw the film or where, but it stayed with me. I really feel the film never got its appropriate praise or fan fair, but maybe some films are meant to be discovered by people as hidden gems and aren't meant to be touted as classics. Though I feel this one is. I felt that Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek were the cornerstones of the film and deepened the work by providing three dimensional characters that had more to do than just worry about a cause. They had lives to lead and families to raise and the film focuses on their daily living and how they lived it with this larger situation going on around them. This choice of direction brings us into the story much quicker because it focuses on the people and the impact the situation has on them. What stays with me is the subtlety and how small gestures can have a great impact. My favorite movies are about people. Real people interest me more than perfect people. This movie kept me interested. I bought this film on clearance and when I saw the $7.99 price tag I thought to myself - 'This is worth so much more' And it is!",
         "The real life, 1955, bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama provides the backdrop for this fictional story about an upper middle class white homemaker named Miriam Thompson (Sissy Spacek) who gradually becomes disenchanted with racial segregation. Her changed attitude comes about as a direct result of her Black maid, a woman of deep moral principles named Odessa Cotter (Whoopi Goldberg). Odessa normally would take the bus to work. But she supports the boycott, and therefore chooses to walk the long distance from her shabby house to the manicured, suburban Thompson home. Yet, despite several incidences wherein Southern whites display their hatred of the boycott and of Blacks in general, Odessa, with the support of her own family and her religious faith, maintains a respectful and thoughtful attitude toward Miriam and the Thompson family. The story is told in retrospect, from the viewpoint of Miriam's daughter, Mary Catherine (Lexi Randall), who was seven years old at the time. There is nothing subtle about this slow paced story. It is forceful and frank. The overt hatred by Southern whites toward Blacks is palpable. In no character is this odious racial superiority more evident than in Miriam's cigar chomping brother-in-law, Tunker (well played by Dylan Baker). But Miriam and Odessa relate to each other as individuals, not as members of some group. Perceptive and sensitive, Miriam comes to understand that Southern racist attitudes, those feelings and emotions she grew up with, are passed down through generations. \"You just don't question it\", she tells Odessa, apologetically. Both Miriam and Odessa are multi-dimensional and sufficiently unique to give the story depth of characterization. The acting is fine. Whoopi Goldberg in particular gives a great performance, along with the always reliable Sissy Spacek. The film's production design and period costumes are credible. Lighting is subdued. I liked the background gospel music, but I could have wished for even more. \"We're Marching To Zion\" not only is a great gospel hymn; it's also the film's theme. Technically well made, \"The Long Walk Home\" has value mostly as historical perspective on an important contemporary social issue. As such, the film's message is just as relevant now as it was fifty years ago.",
         "I'm a freshman in high school, and at the moment, we're studying the chronicles of civil rights in my history class. My teacher showed this film to us, and it excited me at first, 'cause I've always thought Whoopi Goldberg was awesome and I've always enjoyed her films. This was no exception. Movies shown in school tend to be boring, bland and uninteresting. So most of the time, when movies are shown, we take it as an opportunity to catch up on sleep. This movie however, kept our heads up the entire time. We were interested, intrigued, and dying to know what would happen next. It was both thought provoking, entertaining, awe inspiring, and it's even to safe to say, highly addictive. My teacher showed the film in 40 minutes intervals, as this how long each class period is and we were always stuck in our seats after the bell rang, wanting to watch more. It made us look forward to coming to class. It's an excellent, excellent movie, that I enjoyed and learned a lot from. * * * *",
         "My mother grew up in the south so I remember going to visit Grandmother and wondering about the cook, Callie. She was silent and frowned at us and we were told to stay away from the kitchen. I think she was at the point of resentment and though my parents didn't like segregation my cousins and aunts and uncles thought it was the only acceptable way. I find in sharing this movie with younger people today they are shocked at the behavior at the party and in the park. They don't realize that life was really like that in some places. I like to improve sensitivity by showing the film and discussing it as groups when we can.",
         "This is a very detailed description of the Black Experience living in the segregation-era South. I don't how people could tolerate such brutality and quasi-fascism like Whoopi Goldberg's character had done in the movie. Nothing is neither sugar-coated nor pious and romanticized for your viewing pleasure. In the Long Walk Home, you can feel the hell of the Black residents especially the maids and midwives right down to their aching feet. You can feel the anger and hurt and fear of Cotter's children when they were encountered and attacked by three racist youths in a city park. You sense the burning hatred of white community ready to counteract the issue of Civil Rights and the bus boycott during Christmas dinner where the senior Mrs. Thompson clearly spewed her bigoted opinion at the table and at the very end of film not only that you felt like you were one of the protesters there on the scene, being taunted and insulted. Spacek's character shows a glimmering sense of naiveté, intelligence, a sense of hope and influence that the resistance to segregation had on a growing number of whites at that time. However, it seems to me that she is the token white sympathizer that most of these films have, although necessary. It's sad to see only the younger Mrs. Thompson and her daughter the only non-racist white people in the entire movie who bothered to question the segregationists. Sometimes movies like these are too brutal for the senses. It makes you ashamed that you live in America. It could be a little too overpowering. Therefore, why couldn't the director add a little sour cream into this 7-alarm chili by adding a scene in which Mrs. Thompson is not the only non-racist by have other women and children explain why they do the racist taunts and bullying because they if they don't join in the bullying \"festivities\" then they'll become targets/victims just like Mrs. Thompson and the Cotters. The characters for the most part were very convincing three-dimensional people, not stereotypes, clichés, thrown into the mix to inform the audience: \"You are in 1950's Alabama!\" The dialog has a tendency to punch your face and grab hold while doing so, refusing to be politically correct and soothing. This movie makes shocks you, intrigues, and makes you angry at all almost every other white person in the film. And it will! Trust me! LWH has the power and the punch and accuracy that the rather corporate -sponsored high school history lesson with a Disney Channel heart \"Ghosts of Mississippi\" seemed to be lacking.",
         "I've never quite understood why this movie was never a success. It has all the great qualities and ingredients that one looks for in a good drama. Historical or not. Aside from \"The Color Purple\",this is one of Whoopi Goldbergs finest movies. She certainly should have gotten an Oscar for this role (which would have made more sense to me than winning from her smaller role in \"Ghost\"). The movie did moderate to lesser business at the main box office and in no time at all,was in the \"cheap\" theatre's. That is where I saw this in 1991 and it was \"the\" best movie I saw in that kind of theatre (until Ray in Feb. 2005). The story of how Goldberg's character has to walk many miles from her home to her housekeeper's job across town,speaks volumes on how the times were in 1950s south. Nearly 100 years after the civil-war had liberated them,blacks were still treated as second or third rate citizens. I agree this is a great movie for kids learning about the downsides in our country's history,as well as the positives. As seen above ten stars is my vote and I hope this movie is your vote for renting,buying or checking out from a library. It's a simply,honest look at prejudice and the ways man can be so unkind to each-other. It's a great film,period. (END)",
         "whoopi goldberg shines in this gripping and moving racial drama! she won the oscar for \"ghost\" (released the same year), but better deserved it for this film. i think that just goes to demonstrate underlying racism in hollywood (giving the award for a comedic performance by a black performer), which as of the academy awards 2002 has seemingly begun to crack. the film is a triumph of spirit and emotionally challenging to watch at times. it just makes me shake my head at how slow understanding between people who are different can be. this is one film all involved should be very proud of!!",
         "Whoopie Goldberg got gypped in 1990, when she was nominated for, and won Best SUPPORTING actress for the movie \"Ghost\". THIS was the movie she should have been nominated for; in the BEST ACTRESS category. This was one of the finest performances of the year, and definitely of Ms. Goldberg's career. Regrettably, she is too well remembered as a comedienne. People forget how well she handles drama. This is a performance worth seeing. Sissy Spacek is fresh and forthright; and the story manages to be didactic without being heavy handed."
