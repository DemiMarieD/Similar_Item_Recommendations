         "You are never too old or too young to be cheered up by Zeus and Roxanne. Steve Guttenberg and Kathleen Quinlan have surprisingly electric chemistry together. But Roxanne the dolphin and Zeus the dog light up the sky with their fireworks. The kids are great too. But, a movie like this needs a worthy villain. Although I never heard of Arnold Vosloo before, he does a marvelous job playing Oil Can Harry to Steve Guttenberg's Mighty Mouse. Sure, it's far-fetched. It's supposed to be. Just relax and have fun.",
         "I got \"hooked\" on this movie while I was waiting to pay for a clock radio at my local electronics show. They had \"Zeus and Roxanne\" playing on a big screen tv by the cashier's area. The movie had just started and I watched a great scene of animal antics where Zeus the dog creates mayhem in the neighborhood through his obsession with chasing a cat. I've always been a sucker for movies featuring animal antics, and this one is chock full of them. It reminded me of the old \"Flipper\" tv shows, only with a somewhat more exotic locale. The story line is that a widowed composer and his son and dog (the aforementioned Zeus) move into a house on some Florida Key (actually filmed in the Bahamas). By chance their neighbor is a marine biologist and has two daughters. Anyway, Zeus and the cat bring father and mother together, which leads to Zeus discovering Roxanne, a dolphin raised in captivity that the mother biologist is trying to re-introduce into a dolphin \"pod.\" Zeus and Roxanne can \"talk\" with each other, leading to attempts by a nasty \"animal-unfriendly\" scientist to want to use Roxanne for his own selfish ends. Sure the plot is contrived and filled with obvious gags, etc. but at least it has an interesting and environmentally correct theme, and the animals do a great job of keeping the movie visually interesting. I particularly enjoyed the way the camera shots were laid out so that viewers get an \"animal's eye view\" throughout the movie. Unlike many \"art\" films, this story at least makes sense, shows people (including children) doing worthwhile things and being nice to each other. Another plus is the use of minority actors in non-stereotype roles.",
         "I really like this movie because 1) it reminds me of being 7 years old and 2) because dolphins and dogs should always shout out their love to the world. The setting is gorgeous, Florida Keys and sometimes the Bahamas I hear...Perfect for this comedy. It's a family comedy, that's what it is. A perfect one. I really recommend it if you have kids, and if you live in a cold place. It'll instantly brighten up your day. Plus, it makes sense. And that's what a movie should do. I really enjoyed the romance-aspect. The double plot of romance was surprising to find in a movie that was marketed to a young audience. A double plot is hard to pull off. I got it when I was 7 and I get it now. This is a great movie.",
         "I first saw this on a bus returning from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. Unfortunately, by the time the guide got it going we only saw about 45 minutes of it before we got back to Orlando. I had enjoyed it immensely and wanted to see how it turned out. Fortunately over 12 months later Sky got around to showing it and I was delighted that it was as sweet as I remembered. I'm usually a bit of a cynic with \"family\" movies, but, this had such a nice feel about it and on a miserable British winter day it was a great tonic. I had often wondered what had happened to Steve Guttenburg and he turned in a nice performance as did Kathleen Quinlan. The kids were good too, not sickly sweet and nauseating as some movie kids are. As for the comment about the kid with the Goth look, you have no clue about teenagers, she came across as a typical one. The animals were good too and all in all it was a nice easy to watch movie and I'd rather watch it 10 times than have to sit through \"Big Momma's House 2\" and it's ilk just the once. 7 out of 10.",
         "I was depressed when I saw it, and it cheered me up. Silly - in the best possible sense of the word. Guttenbuurg and Arquette are ideal as the parents; the kids are perfect; the villain is fun; and the dolphin is beautiful - but Zeus, the dog, really steals the film. Watch and enjoy with any kid you know - especially your boyfriend (tee-hee).",
         "There are very few movies that I can heartily recommend to others, but I have no reservations about suggesting \"Zeus and Roxanne\". If I had grandchildren, I would buy this one for them; we could watch it together without any awkward moments. That alone makes this movie a gem. The characters are pleasant and appear to be normal people who behave respectably. There is no degrading language which so often spoils other movies that I might otherwise have liked to recommend to others. I am not ordinarily an \"animal\" person, but I do tend to smile where dolphins are concerned. This is probably because they exhibit traits that I would like to see in myself. They present a totally positive image and are therefore a significant part of this good-feeling cinema work. Even the canine in this movie is not annoying, but very appealing. I usually watch mysteries, but \"Zeus and Roxanne\" is a very pleasant change of entertainment atmosphere. I wish that I had the ability to personally thank all who are responsible for bringing this film into my home today on TV! Since I can't, I'll just ask God to bless each of you in a special way.",
         "This is the worst movie I have seen starring Steve Guttenberg. It was released in early 1997, The Spice Girls had just made their first American hit, Hanson was months away and this film was all that was salvaged from the horrible over teenie bopping that year. It has Marilyn Manson goth wannabes written all over it. Steve dresses fully in black through most of the movie, the adolescent girl wears black lipstick and only uses her soon to be stepfather for his DBBS satellite dish. The dog does that stupid growl thing every five minutes and the dolphin deserved better."
