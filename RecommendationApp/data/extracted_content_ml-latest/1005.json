         "This Disney film made me much happier than D2 did. I really enjoyed the way it was much more true to the first film than D2 was. This movie used examples from the first film (\"He's been the captain since they played in District 5,\" the announcer utters during the first game.) This time, the team is shy one member (Jesse) but it really seems no different. I do still wonder what happened to all those people who played in the first movie and were never heard from again. Oh well. In this film, it's almost a rehash of the first film. A team who cannot get it together, get a washed up hockey player who they hate to coach them and they love him...your basic family fun, Disney flick. All in all this was a great movie, but hopefully Disney realizes that we've had enough. *** out of ****",
         "WHAT?! Stupid, dumb, poor scripted, sad, awful... Those aren't enough words to describe it! The first movie was good, the second was outstanding, so why couldn't they have made this one the best, which would have been a perfect conclusion? If you haven't seen this and would like to, I'd recommend stopping at the second! HERE COMES SPOILERS: SPOILERS: First, the great guy Gordon Bombay can't even coach them anymore. Second, they are placed in a good academy, but are treated like dirt, and are badly bullied by bigger kids on the varsity team. There is very little hockey played, and like he should be--Charlie is furious with the new coach (a jerk at first) and the awful time he's having. Things improve, but what I hated was that their good friend Hans died. BAD ENOUGH THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IN REALITY, so why did they make them lose such a close friend?! FINALLY, things start improving, when coach O'Rion gets his head out of his butt and starts being nice. UNFORTUNATELY, Bombay never comes back! They win the Hockey game and get their two MVPs back, but don't have what they started with! Not only that, but it was just a TERRIBLE ending to the great first two movies! Poorly written, and definitely not as much effort and hard work as the second! Why was the second so wonderful, and the third GARBAGE?!!!! I strongly suggest stopping at the second. This was terrible, and I give it a grade of D, and a LOW 3!",
         "I'm not sure exactly why so many people think of the Mighty Ducks movies as silly and pointless. I was never good at sports, but I have always believed that, with proper coaching, any sport could teach children and teenagers about life. The third installment of this series, directed more toward teenagers than anyone else, really shows how teamwork and positive thinking can overcome obstacles and help them grow. I have seen D3 many times and yet as I recently bought the DVD and watched it again, I couldn't help but cheer for the Ducks.",
         "Over all, this is an average movie. Here are the negative parts of the film. What was the point in putting Emilio Estevez's name on the front cover of the movie box if he is only in about three scenes of the movie? In the first place he should of been their coach through the series. This movie also had a lack of hockey. How realistic is it to come back from 9-0 in one period of hockey? Disney you need to give me a break. Here is also something unrealistic. Don't you think the ducks would be the varsity team? In D2 they went to the junior good will games and played on team USA. They should be able to easily beat the real varsity team. Like Adam Banks said in D2 they were good enough to play against the world. Coach Orion was annoying too. Bad mistake for Bombay to leave. Like I was saying before the movie had a lack of hockey. Throughout the movie you only see them play three games. Here are the positive things to say. The pranks were funny. I especially liked the one with horse turd. Over all I give this movie ** of ****.",
         "****SPOILER ALERT**** This movie doesn't even do justice to D2. Just a disgrace. I think what Disney was trying to do was change things up a bit by adding some new characters, but in doing so they took away probably some of the best. THE BAD 1. A new coach-I don't even remember the new coach's name, he doesn't deserve to be remembered. This movie was bad five minutes into it when they announced Bombay was out. *Bad* 2. Loss of players- Where's Jesse Hall? and Dean Portman? and everyone else they had that was so likable? Why'd they put Banks on Varsity? Why was Disney so dumb? 3. Bad humor- These players are now and high school and the humor is less mature than either of the first two movies. These kids were more rebellious when they were thirteen. That makes no sense. 4. Acting- Oh My God. Enough said 5. Hans- Why? Why Hans? Why kill Hans? He was like, a roll model. I loved Hans in the first one. I hated this movie so much. THE GOOD 1. What They Realised- Disney realised that they needed to stop being big dumb dumbs and bring the old characters back. So Portman came back, that was good. And Bombay came back. I really hope this is the last Mighty Ducks movie, because the only thing that brightened my day was the ending, when Bombay walked out the door to the theme song, and then the flashback of the ending of the first movie came on. That left me feeling better. And I thought, \"wow, good way to end it\" The ending gets a ten out of ten but doesn't make the movie good enough so overall a 2/10...only gets a 2 because of the end.",
         "It's difficult to express just how atrociously bad this Duck shoot is. The Ducks have, en bloc, won scholarships to the snobbish private school Banks (Vincent LaRusso) attends. This offends the sensibilities of the varsity hockey team. WHY it offends them is never made entirely clear, since the Ducks will probably assure continuing championships for their school, establishing a \"dynasty\" tradition of which the current varsity players will be the spearhead. Much mayhem ensues as the two rival cliques play vicious trick after vicious trick upon one another. (I don't consider covering someone with fire ants or dining and dashing on an $853 restaurant bill to be \"jokes\" -- they are just plain sadistic.) A very thinly veiled sadism is apparent throughout D3. The final victory of the Ducks is *not* achieved through skill, expertise, or courage -- it is achieved by physically brutalizing the varsity team. (Is it a spoiler to reveal what any eight year old knows even before watching a Mighty Ducks movie? They *never* lose The Big Game. Watching these things is about as suspenseful as watching moss grow.) In the most egregious act of brutality in the movie, one of the varsity players is hurled off the rink, through the glass enclosure, and into the stands, which is physically impossible, which may be why the crowd grows wild cheering for it -- ignoring the very real possibility that the varsity player has broken one or both legs, possibly his spine, and has undoubtedly received a concussion. This is a *good* thing because the now permanently crippled high school student doesn't like Pacey ... er ... Charlie. One of the stupidest moments is the saving of the scholarships of the Ducks (yeah, the same old stuff Disney has been spewing out since Tommy Kirk and Kurt Russel were doing teen comedies for them). Their attorney (of course the Ducks have an attorney!) argues that the scholarships offered to and accepted by the Ducks is a contract binding the school to allow the Ducks to play hockey. Hunh? What fool writes a scholarship grant which gives the recipient power over the grantor and the school? What kind of Mickey Mouse lawyer did the school have writing those things? (Maybe that was the problem -- they needed one of the Mouse's attorneys.) Even more idiotic is the moment when the Ducks are allowed to keep their own team name and colors instead of being Eden Hall Warriors. What? The baseball, basketball, and football teams are going to change *their* team names and colors because of a freaking *hockey* team?!?! In Canada, maybe, but this ain't set in Canada. Yeah, the kids are cute, but ... well, that is the *only* thing this piece of duck dreck has going for it. Watch it with the sound off and look at their perfect, pretty punims. Nothing anyone says in this thing is worth listening to. It is certainly nothing that children should be allowed to watch -- this thing is so viciously, sadisticly violent that I think the MPAA should have given it an \"R\" rating -- no one under 17 admitted without a parent or guardian.",
         "I've got a real soft spot for these movies; I adored the first movie when it was first released and although it's not that great now, all three films have a good deal of charm and the cast has genuine chemistry. 'D3' is just really enjoyable stuff. Emilio Estevez isn't around much (still billed first in the credits, though) and he is missed despite the original film's central relationship between him and the kids being repeated here with a new coach. But there's enough here that's new to the series (if not to cinema in general) to make this worthwhile once the weak opening is out of the way. David Newman's score is genuinely good, making the hockey games rousing - as in 'D2', easily the highlight of the movie - and giving the movie real momentum. It's no classic, but it's likable and engaging.",
         "In \"D3: The Mighty Ducks,\" the same old cast of characters returns for some more good old times on the ice. The scrappy, wise-cracking kids that formed The Mighty Ducks hockey team are now full-blown teenagers, voice-changes and all. This time around, they are awarded scholarships to the prestigious Eden Hall Academy, a school who take their hockey just a bit too seriously. Emilio Estevez's character is written out of most of the movie, making way for the hard-headed Coach Orion (Jeff Nordling), who leads The Ducks under their new moniker, The Warriors. As they fight for dominance with the varsity team, they also have to fight for their right to stay in school, lest the school board revoke their scholarships and cast them out simply for not fitting in. Along the way they learn more valuable life lessons and grow with one another, yada yada yada, so on and so forth. If it feels like the formula is wearing thin, that's because it is. Don't be mistaken, \"D3\" is of the same caliber as \"D2: The Mighty Ducks.\" It's an entertaining enough, simple and nostalgic sports flick that appeals to the whole family, but is nowhere near as inspiring and as spirited as the original. When compared to the original \"The Mighty Ducks,\" this is just a ho-hum sequel that offers nothing new and is obviously made with intentions of milking a franchise name, which is made abundantly clear by its low budget look. But when it comes to Disney and its track-record for sequels, would you expect anything less? It's not all bad though. The acting from the kids is spot on and their chemistry is great as usual. Hans (Joss Ackland) makes his return to the series and even though Emilio Estevez looks tired in the twenty minutes or so he spends in the film, it's better than not having him at all. His turn as the Ducks' lawyer is a stand-out, a nice call-back to the original film. Overall, \"D3: The Mighty Ducks\" is a contradiction, a mediocre display of nostalgia. It's entertaining enough, but too bland to really have a lasting effect. See it if only to complete the \"trilogy\" (although I get the feeling that if Disney felt they could, they would have forced more movies out of it) and to reminisce in the good old days, before Emilio Estevez faded away completely, before Joshua Jackson became irritating and before Kenan Thompson went SNL.",
         "D3:THE MIGHTY DUCKS is the follow-up to the original MIGHTY DUCKS, and its sequel, D2: THE MIGHTY DUCKS. Although it is not as good as the others, it is enjoyable at times, and has a very good storyline. It has all of Ducks attending college at Eden Hall University, where they are considered worthless scrubs. In order to prove themselves, they need to beat the Eden Hall varsity squad. The reason this movie is lacking is because Emilio Estevez, the standout star of the previous 2 movies, disappears 5 minutes into the movie, and does not even make another appearance until the end. Another reason is because some fan-favorites from the first two did not make it to the third, including the Hall brothers, Jesse and Terry, Peter, and Karp. Although the movie recieves a huge lift when Dean Portman returns to the squad and helps them win the game against the varsity team, it does not have the same feeling of a camaraderie as the first two. This could have been a great movie, if certain changes were made. It is still an enjoyable family movie.",
         "This is probably the best of the series. Things that I liked about the movie: The kids grow up and if there's something enjoyable, it's that they kept most of the members from the first two. So watching their lives just make us warm and fuzzy. It's funny watching the hijinks of the team as the college seniors make life hell for the Ducks and vice-versa. Plus, we see the team try to adjust training under a new coach. The hockey games in this movies are always fun to watch. What I didn't like: We don't see enough about the new coach to make us care about him and the way he commands the team. I give this 4 of 5 stars."
