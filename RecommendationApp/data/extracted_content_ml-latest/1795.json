         "Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian novelist, whose \"Midaq Alley\" serves as the basis of this film, wrote about the characters that populate that narrow strip of an Egyptian city, and how in some ways, all of their lives are so inter-connected to one another. Director Jorge Fons and the adapter, Vicente Lenero, transferred the action to Mexico City. They used the same format that Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu later used for his successful \"Amores Perros\" in 2000. It would be unfair to compare both films, yet, one can see certain parallels in the way the films unfold. Each narrative shows exact moments in which the lives of the people that part of town prove pivotal for the stories presented in the film. There are four stories in the film. Each deals with what happened to that particular character while all have points in which they connect with the others. The film shows that when Mexican filmmakers want to tell interesting human stories, such as the ones depicted in the film, they don't have a thing to envy to the best types of cinema of the world. This is clearly a movie that will survive because of its universal themes. Salma Hayek was making her second appearance in front of the cameras. She proved why she was an actress to be reckoned with. Her Alma shows a vulnerability, and freshness as she approaches the character. Ernesto Gomez Cruz, Maria Rojo, Bruno Bichir, Daniel Gimenez Cacho, Luis Felipe Tovar and the rest of the cast do excellent ensemble work under Mr. Fons direction. The film will not disappoint the viewer.",
         "This movie is an impressive and exciting story about the people,their feelings,love,desperation,anger and hope.Although the scenario is a little bit melodramatic , the film is a must indeed.It is quite different from the blockbusters with happy ends because it is real and outstanding.Several lives and fates are mixed in it.Every character has their own unique personality.They all have to take decisions for their lives and have to fight for happiness.The actors are very nice.The stunning Hayek makes a good performance .Gomes Krus is also convincing as a man who becomes gay after 30 years marriage.The supporting roles are also well-played.Don't think that this is some kind of soap opera- it is something deeper...",
         "A film of surprising depth and frankness, this is no Mexican soap opera. The film is told in chapters, one about each major character. They all come from the same neighborhood and their lives intertwine. For the most part the stories wind up in disappointment, with few moments of sweetness, and some real tragedies. It's not quite a slice of life, but compares very favorably to the similar American film Short Cuts by Robert Altman. Without going into too much detail, it follows a late mid-life 'crisis' of a bar owner named Rutilio who finally allows his inner yearnings to surface, almost at the cost of his family. The second chapter follows Alma (Salma Hayek, the only recognizable name from the cast) as a lovely ghetto girl who is torn by the absence of her fiance who is in America and the desires, needs and temptations of being young, lovely, and inexperienced. The third chapter is about Susanna, the local landlord, middle-aged, homely, and never-been-loved and the trials she puts herself through after a fateful tarot-card reading predicting the imminent appearance of a man in her life. The last chapter, the Return, ties all the strings together as best they can be, because this is life and the strings simply don't tie together that well. I didn't expect a Mexican film of this frankness - not just sex, but characters having real conversations, smoking grass, getting mixed up in an underworld with a sheen of decency and the expected rotten core - all rotating around the table in the neighborhood bar where the men play dominoes. These comments may not have convinced you to see this movie, but if you did see and liked Short Cuts then I highly recommend this film. And if Short Cuts is gobbledegook to you then I recommend both. Nine out of Ten.",
         "WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: I'm writing my first review ever so please understand. This film deservedly won many awards. It is not a Hollywood glamour film by any means, but on the contrary, it is a deep film that shows how people live complex, rich, and tragic lives in a poor neighborhood of Mexico. The acting also is superb. Every character is believable and Salma Hayek stands out as the only known star. This is the best I've ever seen her and her acting in the final scene is very impressive. The movie begins in the bar of Rutilio. A few middle age men are playing dominos and jokingly playfully yet also talking about their lives. Rutilio's son Chava, his friend Abel, and the bartender are in the background. The movie first focuses on the story of Rutilio, who allows his homosexual feelings to surface. Of course, he must face the consequences when his family finds out. One of the first great scenes of the movie is when, after abusing his wife a few days earlier, he's crying on her lap and looking for comfort and she's reluctant to console him. The movie also subtly introduces other characters during this first chapter. After this scene, the movie returns to the same beginning scene and yet focuses on other characters: the men around the table, Abel, Rutilio, and the bartender. Through these characters' relationships with others, it introduces us to new characters, namely Alma, and Susana. The movie paints all of these characters very richly in many different colors. They all (except perhaps the two thieves and Jose Luis) live complex lives, are faced with difficult dilemmas, and are in many, complicated relationships. For example: --Abel lives solely for the love of Alma and would enjoy just to be around her forever. Yet he realizes that without money, he cannot please her mother nor live happily with her. Additionally his best friend Chava asks him to leave to America with him. He decides to leave and work for the long term, using his picture of Alma as his motivation. --Alma, on the other hand, is a young, naive girl. Her mother and her are poor and they live in a small apartment. She wants to escapes to a better world, just as anybody would. Thus when Jose Luis comes and offers her a world of mansions, money, and sex, she abandons her world and her wait for Abel; for she wants her immediate desires to be fulfilled. How would she know that she would become trapped in Jose Luis' vicious circle and become addicted to cocaine? Yet this movie does not stop with these people. It reveals the inner lives of even more people in the neighborhood. At first, one only sees these people on the outside and only learn a little bit about them. They are playing dominos, walking around, or looking at tarot cards. Yet as the movie progresses, it goes inside their lives and shows how complex and human these people are. Even the shop owner, who at first just seems a one-dimensional lecher, actually wants to get remarried, and please Alma by taking her to the opera and the theater. Guicho, the bartender, who at first appears only as a thief and somebody who takes advantages of others, struggles to stop his impulse to steal and truly loves Susana. Additionally, the film is full of excellent dialogue and has a well-written script. This film is not dark at all even with all the tragedy in these peoples' lives. It is fully of witty jokes, poetry (from the bookstore owner), and even a few comic characters. Manu, for example, always jokes and says, `Well, seriously. . .' Moreover, it is full of a few excellent, intense scenes that fully depict the emotion of the characters. I've already mentioned the one with Rutilio, but others include the ones in which Guicho kisses Susana's feet while she sobs, Alma crumples Abel's letter and holds it near to her face, and of course Alma's despair in the final scene. In the end, the movie does not resolve any of the problems nor give us a fairy tale ending. But this movie shows real lives. The characters' problems and their relationships cannot be changed with the flick of a wand. Instead, it beautifully shows a certain time period in these characters' lives. They will continue to live and struggle to solve their problems. Alma might never escape Jose Luis's dominion and Chava will continue to be a womanizer and ignore his wife. Perhaps this movie has no dominating themes. But it does depict how real people have faced real situations, and how they responded to them. It shows this though in a way only movies can do it with charming dialogue, intense actions, and actors that light up the screen by illustrating many different emotions. Not only does this movie shows how difficult life is in modern Mexico, but also how people respond to their own dilemmas in their lives. It is an excellent movie, one of the best I've seen recently, and perhaps of the 90s.",
         "Midaq Alley is the best foreign movie of 1995. The movie take place in Mexico's Downtown in a street named: \" Midaq Alley\". Basically the film show us the stories of three people from that neighborhood. Mr Ru whom after 30 tears of marriage is feeling homosexual falling in love with a young guy the same age as his son, making his wife's life miserable. Susanita and old lady whom never been married and doesn't know what is love, finally she falls for someone not very honest. The other one is Alma , played for Salma Hayek a young, beautiful virgin girl whom is interested in everything about sex and drugs. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It's worth the money!!",
         "Written by a Nobel Prize winner (Naguib Mahfouz for his life work, including this story). Midaq Alley is a remake of the 1963 movie listed on IMDb as: Zouqâq al-Midaqq (1963)...aka Alley of the Pestle (1963) (International: English title) Which was itself an excellent movie. VERY MINOR SPOILERS GOING FORWARD: The characters in both movie stick closely to the story, the Mexican version benefits from freedom of expression in many shots while the Egyptian version had to hint behaviours (homosexuality for example) to avoid censors scissors. It amazes me how a story about characters in Cairo in the 40's could fit so closely in Mexico city half a world away.... tells you something about the similarities in human nature and behaviours... Very minor details had to be changed to suite historical facts. As an example, when the two boys run away to collaborate with the occupying British forces in the Egyptian film, they try to cross the border illegally to the US in the Mexican version. Both give the same effect as socially unacceptable behaviours within their perspective societies. All actors put convincing performances and beautiful Salma Hayek dazzles as usual.",
         "This story demonstrates the intertwined and tragic minutia of common folks told in a dramatic and realistic format. The ensemble cast members are at ease with one another as they display acts of beauty and brutality. The theme of love unfolds from the neophyte, to the jaded, to the unabashed. The actors appear natural and believable (unlike some Latin \"novelas\"), developing their characters in a seamless and effortless fashion. The devotion to cultural stereotypes only lends credibility to the story's environment and development. The attention to detail (Susanita's teeth for example); make the characters as believable and endearing as any in recent memory. This movie is a brilliant look at human tragedy. Watching it with someone you love only makes it more moving and poignant. Excellent!!!",
         "The melodramatic film called El Callejon De Los Milagros tells four stories focusing on different characters that show how their lives are interconnected. The film starts by introducing Rutilio, a hard working bar owner who discovers he is homosexual. The second story introduces Alma, played by familiar Salma Hayek, who dreams of escaping her middle class lifestyle. The plot focuses on Alma, whose goddess-like, untouchable character has ultimate control and is wanted by many men. When introduced into the plot, her establishing shot is a low camera angle and almost Juliet-like as she sits in her window sill looking down at Abel, the man that adores her. The third story revolves around Susana, a woman who dreams of finding a husband and uses tarot cards to find answers. In the last story Chava and Abel return home from the U.S. which stitches the stories together, but also tears everyone apart. After the boys return, a theme of torn relationships proves nobody can be trusted and viewers begin to learn that this is not a hegemonic model of a Hollywood film. Relationships begin to crumble, scenes are shot at night, giving the story a dangerous tone, and the ending doesn't leave the audience satisfied. Rutilio crushes his wife and son when they learn he is homosexual, Chava is controlling and disloyal to his new wife, and Susana's money is stolen repeatedly by her husband. Losing patience with her boyfriend, Abel, living in the U.S., Alma becomes engaged to be married. When her fiancé dies she is lured by Jose Luis who offers a spontaneous lifestyle of drugs, sex and money. Ultimately, Alma becomes a whore and a cocaine addict and is no longer in control as Jose Luis tears everything away that matters, including her self worth and even Abel. Ultimately Jose Luis is the most powerful and successful character when it comes to getting what he wants; everyone else is left feeling hopeless. This film is deserving of its many awards as Jorge Fons effectively gives us a story that shows love is not something everyone stumbles upon without effort.",
         "She quickly went on to fame in Desperado and From Dusk Til Dawn, but this, Salma Hayek's second film role, shows her acting talent. In the first of four tales, she is just window dressing. An object of desire for a young boy (Bruno Bichir). While she is sitting, Don Ru (Ernesto Gómez Cruz) is yelling at his son (Juan Manuel Bernal) for acting like \"a queer\" while he himself pursues Jimmy (Esteban Soberanes); and Susanita (Margarita Sanz) is getting her fortune told by Almita's (Hayek) mother, Catalina (María Rojo). After Don Ru's son runs away thinking he has done something awful, and he buries his head in his wife's lap moaning. the story starts all over with an emphasis on Almita. She, tragically, ends up with Jose Luis (Daniel Giménez Cacho) and disappears. Susanita is growing older and desperate to find a man. She fancies Don Ru's son, but ends up with Guicho (Luis Felipe Tovar). So, does the prodigal son return? Does Almicita come home? How are things to end? The story is first rate and it has you on the edge of you seat wondering how it all ties together.",
         "This film was not made for Americans, or even with the thought of marketing outside the USA. Just like Hollywood remakes will redo a story for the US, this took a story written for Cairo and transplanted it to Mexico City without a trace of the original setting. It is framed and acted much like a stage play, and the focus is on the people. It's painful to watch at times, because the story grinds your nose against stories of people who are getting through some unpleasant times in some unpleasant ways and the pace does not let you escape - it is clear they want you to endure something of what the characters are going through. The acting is generally good, there are convincing portraits of a half dozen main characters and the supports aren't bad. Yep, the overall ending is predictable, but not unbelievable and a few of the side stories might surprise you along the way. I watched the DVD version. It has no extras or options. You get dialog in Spanish, English subtitles, in 4:3 format - no choices. Sound is stereo, color is ok and picture is competent."

         "Based on the Nobel Prize Winner's novel, the Egyptian Naguib Mahfouz. The story, translated from El Cairo to Mexico City's downtown, narrates the life of the members of the neighbourhood and the connection between them Don Ru, the owner of the local pub; Eusebia, his wife; Chava, his son and Abel his friend, who emigrate to USA in search of fortune; Susanita, the single landtender always dreaming to marry a good man; Guicho, the pub's employee, who extracts the money when Don Ru is not there and finally marries Susanita; Alma, the very good looking girl, the Abel's dream, who becomes a luxury prostitute while he's away; Jimmy, the handsome young man Don Ru becomes infatuated with, etc. This movie won the Ariel (the Mexican Oscar) as best movie in 1995.",
         "The lives of the inhabitants of El Callejon de los Milagros, in downtown Mexico City, are closely knitted as the threads of a rug. Fifty-something Don Ru (Gomez Cruz) owns a small \"cantina\" where all the men spend afternoons playing domino. He's tired of his longtime marriage with Eusebia (Casanova) and has recently discovered new feelings inside his heart. It doesn't matter if these feelings are not aimed to a young lady but to a young clerk (Soberanes): after all, as one of the characters says, \"it's platonic love\". Don Ru's son Chava (Bernal) doesn't like what he sees and almost kills his father's lover. Running away from Don Ru's anger, Chava escapes to the USA with his friend Abel (Bichir) who's deeply in love with beautiful Alma (Hayek), the daughter of Dona Cata (Rojo), a tarot reader with bad luck in love. Susanita (Sanz), the ugly landlady looking for love; Guicho (Tovar), Don Ru's cinic employee, Maru (Scanda), Don Fidel (Obregon), Dona Flor (Morett), Zacarias (Woolrich) and mean Jose Luis (Gimenez Cacho) complete the cast of characters of this complex portrait of lives."
