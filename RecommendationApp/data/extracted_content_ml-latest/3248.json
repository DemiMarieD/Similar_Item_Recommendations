         "I just love to read some of the negative comments on a film like this. This is a movie about a Las Vegas headliner who is called to help deal with unruly kids at a Catholic school. You were expecting maybe Schindler's List? When did it become such a crime just to enjoy a delightful movie packed with talent all geared toward entertainment? And what talent. Whoopi Goldberg, Lauryn Hill, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Kathy Najimy, Maggie Smith, James Coburn, Michael Jeter, and more. It's adorable and it handily meets its goal of being entertaining. All I can say is that I pity people who have become so jaded, or are so concerned with being cool, that they can't enjoy such a funny and charming film.",
         "SISTER ACT 2: BACK IN THE HABIT, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy about sticking together. It really made me feel good and smile, especially when Deloris (Whoopi Goldberg) performed her solo act at the beginning of the movie. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. The best things about it, in my opinion, are the musical number. My favorite song of the movie would have to be either \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" or the St. Francis Academy's rendition of \"Joyful, Joyful.\" In conclusion, if you like Whoopi Goldberg films, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a good time and lots of laughs, so see this movie today.",
         "I don't care what most people say...I loved this movie!! I thought it was better than the 1st but I can see from reading the other comments not many people agree with me, but that's OK. I'll just be alone in this one. What makes it for me is the teenagers. I love the kids in this movie. Amual makes me crack up every time I watch it and I think Lauryn Hill is fabulous! OK so the ending is very predictable but I think would have been disappointed if they hadn't won. Am I right?! I love watching the ending over and over, or when Amual hits that high note for their first concert. Anyways...I don't see how people don't love this movie, it's so fun and has such a great message! I'd much rather watch teenagers that I can relate to in the sequel than a bunch of old nuns in the 1st Sister Act but that's just me! Guess I'm alone here! One thing I want to say though regardless of anything is that I think every school choir should show this movie! I'm in the choir at my school and unfortunately we have very little spirit and most people in it don't care very much. I'm going to recommend that we show this movie to my choir teacher. It may not help but it can't hurt. I recommend every choir see this one just to show that a choir can dance and have fun while singing. At least show the ending if nothing else! Ok there's my two cents! Everyone needs to see the movie at least for the music and to have a good time! I give this movie a 9.5/10!",
         "As someone who is more into edgy, thriller movies, I would just DIE of embarrassment if anyone I know knew how much I love this film! I don't know why, because it is an eternal cheese-fest, but it is such a feel-good film. I love everything about it from the Whoopi Goldberg and Lauren Hill to the corny storyline. OK, so it's certainly no masterpiece, but it's also no Teenwolf 2 either. I think this is an underrated gem and deserves more than the 4.5 rating it has received. It's worth watching just to hear the amazing voices of some of the individuals involved. I think everyone has a cheesy film they secretly love, and this is definitely mine - just don't tell anyone!!!!",
         "When the Nun's get sick of the unruly behaviour the kids display during school, and the lack of work that is being done, Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) calls upon Sister Mary Clarence, Deloris Van Cartier for help. So she's goin' back to the convent. She's gettin' back into that uniform, and, she's gettin' back in the habit! While there, Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) manages to transform the music class of non-listening, no attention-paying roudy little snots into a magical choir with voices of gold. It is here, that they decide to enter the regional championships for school singing (or something along those lines). However, one girl in particular, once a drop-out, with an awesome voice (played brilliantly by Fugee's frontwoman Lauryn Hill), is not intially allowed to go. Her mother (played by another R 'N' B singer Sheryl Lee Ralph, also from 'Moesha') will not allow her to. So she forges her signature and they head off to the championships. Jennifer Love Hewitt stars here, as one of the singing kids from the music class (bearing in mind, that she has since released 3 albums). Wendy Makkena and Kathy Najimy reprise their roles as two of the most-mentioned Nuns. Once again, Whoopi manages to pull off another great movie, without a great deal of trouble. Lot's of fun, but I enjoyed the first one, just a little bit more. 7./10",
         "such a pleasure, albeit a guilty one! The original wasn't good enough to warrant a sequel. Nonetheless, the choirs are so talented; their acts never get tired no matter how many times this piece re-runs on cable. Whatever her other pros and cons, Whoopi plays to the ensemble in this one, never the scene hog. What a pleasure to see an icon like Maggie Smith so thoroughly and obviously enjoying herself---ditto Mary Wickes, after being such a steadfast fixture of a supporting character on screen for nearly 70 years, her penultimate screen appearance. and really that's the whole point here isn't it? simple enjoyment, by actors and audience, in a meld of plots so familiar and comfortable, especially at holiday time. Among them--- Hey Kids Let's Put on a Show and Save Grandpa's Farm... Fish Out of Water Makes Good... Stick Together and Win the Big Game...",
         "It's one year later, Deloris has returned back to singing in Las Vegas, mobsters locked up. Things are OK until she is asked a favor by the head nun to return as a music teacher at the school the church runs. Things don't start off correctly, a bunch of neighborhood students, kids who have seen rough times, she tries to show them the talent they have in their voices. But it is going take some time and patience to prepare them for a big singing show. One day while practicing Deloris discovers that the students have been invited to sing for the pope, which we all hope it will go well. This was one of the best movies Whoopi has done.",
         "This is an acceptable though inferior sequel to ¨Sister act¨ , a surprising box office hit ; it has a similar casting and set at an old High School which is destined for closure . The club singer Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is again asked to don the nun's habit to help a Catholic school , presided over by Superior Mother (Maggie Smith) and formed by charming nuns (Wendy Makkenna, Kathy Najimy , Mary Wickes, among others). Friendly Deloris back and has to teach music to a bunch of students in their parochial college which is fated for closure . She creates a choir to participate in the state championship . A group of stereotypical botcher monks (Barnard Hughes , Michael Jeter) and a greedy administrator (James Coburn) attempt to detain them . However ,one of the girls (Lauryn Hill) , who is the most talented of the team , is banned to sing by her mummy (Sheryl Lee Ralph) . Los Angeles lounge singer donning nun's habit and organizing the convent choir formed by sympathetic nuns who steal best laughs and including a spectacular as well as amusing concert . This entertaining film with some genuinely funny moments follows the formula about a fish out water . Motormouth and kind Whoopi Goldberg is pretty well as the vaudeville star become unexpected nun , she is a complete show . Whoopi Goldberg was very unhappy making the first film and made this sequel only after Disney decided to finance her dream project, Sarafina! . Good performances from agreeable nuns , Wendy Makkenna , Kathy Najimy , the veteran Mary Wickes and excellent Maggie Smith who disapproves modern methods . Fine support cast , being this the first movie for Lauryn Hill, Ryan Toby and Jennifer Love Hewitt . And Whoopi Goldberg's daughter, Alex Martin, appears in this movie as one of the classroom children . The musical numbers in 'Diana Ross and the Supremes style', magical choreography and songs are catchy and done with gusto . The movie is amusing and entertaining with enjoyable set pieces but don't let it make you expect too much . Well-done musical score with swinging tunes by Marc Shaiman and Miles Goodman ; including colorful cinematography by Oliver Wood . The film is geared directly toward Whoopi Goldberg fans and young viewers . The motion picture was professionally directed by Bill Duke . Bill is a known and prestigious secondary actor , usual in villain roles as Commando (1985) and especially as one of Schwarzenegger's jungle commandos in Depredator (1987). After cutting his directorial teeth on the small screen , Duke directed his first feature film with the crime drama , ¨Rage in Harlem¨ (1991). This was followed by another impressive crime film ¨Deep cover¨ (1992), then made this comedy sequel , Sister Act 2 (1993). Duke has since continued to divide his time between appearing both in front of the camera and behind it , and remains a dynamic, stimulating and creative talent in Hollywood.",
         "I lovveeeeeeeee this movie and have since I was a kid i cannot believe it came out 14 years ago. The first sister act was pretty funny and good but the second was HILARIOUS!! And hello it features the beautiful voice of then unknown Lauryn Hill! Whoopi never ceasing to make me laugh. the cast of students were entertaining and the last performance tore the house down. the movie was AWESOME. The nuns since had me laughing allll the way. This is a classic funny movie that the whole family can enjoy over and over and over again... lol trust me I have. And let me just say if you like Whoopi you will love this movie. If your not a fan of her... don't watch cuz u will not be able to appreciate this work of art.",
         "Compared to most sequels, this is in the top 20. But as for comparison to the first, there is almost no relation. The first was a good movie. Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit does not compare to most movies. Some cheap independent films, if well acted, are better. But some commercial movies are worse than this movie. It had no great acting. Some things were funny. But why didn't the nuns sing again? That would seem most logical to do in this film. And kids? Ok, I guess. But the story line could be changed, and then everything re-vamped, without the practically psychotic men from the monastery, and you have a great movie."
