      "synopsis": "Frank Horrigan ( Clint Eastwood) is a Secret Service who is close to retirement age. When the story opens, he's waiting for a pickup from his new partner, Al D'Andrea ( Dylan McDermott). They drive to a marina just outside of Washington DC to meet with a counterfeiter, Mendoza ( Tobin Bell). Frank and Al are posing as buyers of false currency. Mendoza asks Al to board his yacht; after Al leaves, Mendoza reveals to Frank that he's found out Al is a Secret Service agent. When Frank boards the boat he sees that Mendoza's thugs have bound and gagged Al. Mendoza wants Frank to shoot Al as a test of loyalty. As Frank approaches, he hefts Mendoza's pistol, points it at Al's head and pulls the trigger. The pistol dry-fires and a thug slips a plastic bag over Al's head. Frank asks for his pistol back, IDs himself as an agent and shoots both of Mendoza's thugs. Mendoza tries to shoot Frank, but his weapon jams, and he is quickly captured. Frank later admits to Al that the pistol could have had at least one round in the chamber. A few days later, Al and Frank investigate a report from an elderly landlady who tells them that one of her tenants, Joseph McCrawley, has been acting mysteriously. When they enter the man's apartment, they find paraphernalia related to several presidential assassinations, especially John F Kennedy's. Frank was an agent assigned to Kennedy when he was assassinated in Dallas in 1963, and still feels remorseful that he didn't prevent it. A further search of the room reveals that McCrawley is a skilled machinist who builds model racing cars. Al and Frank return to McCrawley's apartment later to find that it's been emptied and that the shrine to the dead presidents has also vanished. A single picture remains, one of a much younger Frank on Kennedy's detail. Frank's face has been circled in red. Frank goes home that night and receives a phone call, unaware that \"McCrawley\" is watching him from the shadows. \"McCrawley\" then proceeds to call Frank's house phone. He tells Frank to call him \"Booth\" after Lincoln's asassin because the man had more \"flair and panache\". Booth, whose real name is Mitch Leary ( John Malkovich), tells Frank he plans to assassinate the current president ( Jim Curley) and hopes that Frank will be assigned to the case. Leary seems to have a deep admiration for Frank. While on the phone, Frank hears a fire engine passing by Leary's location. Suddenly, he hears the same fire engine rush past his apartment and through the phone line. He runs to the pay phone on corner near his building, and finds the phone hanging off the hook, Leary having already vanished. Frank meets with the Secret Service's director, Sam Campagna ( John Mahoney), and tells them he thinks Booth is definitely dangerous. He agrees to have himself and Al continue their investigation and also asks for his phone to be tapped. Frank has an adversarial relationship with a younger assistant director, Bill Watts ( Gary Cole), who thinks Frank is a burnout. At the meeting Frank also meets a female agent, Lilly Raines ( Rene Russo), whom seems charmed by Frank but also sees through his tough-guy exterior. Later, Frank shares a drink with Sam and requests to be added to the current president's protection detail. Sam suggests he may be too old for the detail but agrees. Leary calls Frank again, still using the \"Booth\" name, telling him that he was watching him that day while Frank was running alongside Kennedy's limo and working crowd control. He also talks in great detail about Frank's history after the Kennedy assassination. Frank had become an alcoholic and his marriage had broken up. Frank checks with the men tapping his phone line and they tell him they've got a location on Leary. However, when a SWAT team raids the house, they find Leary has used a signal jammer to trace the call to a civilian home. Leary next changes his facial hair and flies to Los Angeles. He adapts a new alias as James Carney and drives to a bank downtown. Inside, he proceeds to open up a phony bank account for a fictitious software corporation. While he talks to the account specialist, he mentions that he's from Minneapolis, the same city that she's from. Though he's pleasant with her, Leary suspects she may interfere with his plans. Back in Washington, Frank takes Lilly out for ice cream at the Lincoln Memorial. Though Frank is charming, he still tells Lilly that he believes that female agents work in the Service simply because the President wishes to court the female vote throughout the country. Moments later he determines she may be infatuated with him because of a small gesture as she walks away. Back in Los Angeles, the account specialist has just returned home. She is startled when Leary suddenly appears on the front doorstep. Leary claims to have looked up her name in the phone book, but when she tells him her name isn't listed, he comes clean and admits he followed her home. He then bluffs her into letting him into the house. While Leary talks with the specialist, he gets a new problem when he finds her housemate is home. When the housemate prepares to leave, Leary suddenly blocks her from leaving and closes the front door. He tells the specialist that she shouldn't have been from Minneapolis. The tension is broken when the telephone rings. The teller's roommate goes to grab the phone, and Leary promptly attacks both women. After a struggle, he breaks both women's necks and then flees the scene. Back at the Secret Service office, Frank is engaged in another conversation with Leary. Frank becomes infuriated when Leary suggests that Kennedy had a suspicion he'd be assassinated and that he had a death wish. Leary also claims that Kennedy didn't care about the ramifications of his own assassination when he refused to have agents traveling closer to his motorcade in Dallas. The two men tracing the call tell Frank that Leary is at a phone booth in Lafayette Square, just across the street from the Executive Office building. Everyone runs outside to the park, searching the area for their target. Frank spots a hippyish-looking man with long hair and instinctively knows it's \"Booth\". He runs after him, quickly becoming winded. Leary causes a minor fenderbender and is hit by another car; when he lands on the hood, he touches the windshield. Frank immediately orders the car impounded so they can lift fingerprints. When the FBI matches the prints, they discover that they belong to a former government agent. The information is not shared with either Frank or Al. Frank charges Al with continuing the investigation while he works on protection in the Midwest and Western United States. At one stop Frank works outside in heavy rain and cold temperatures and comes down with a minor illness. Leary is present at an indoor rally. He uses a pin to burst several balloons that the ill Frank mistakes for gunshots. He yells for the detail to escort the President from the room, causing a minor panic. The President resumes his address. Frank is subsequently reprimanded by the White House Chief of Staff, Harry Sargent ( Fred Dalton Thompson), who seems more concerned with the upcoming election than providing adequate security for the president. Frank returns to his DC home to recover from his illness. Al shows up and tells Frank that he'd made a connection between \"Booth\" and his model car hobby. Frank and Al go to Arizona to check on the lead; they talk to a professor of design engineering who tells them to talk to a man named Walter Wickland, a former associate of Leary's. Wickland, who is confined to a wheelchair, gives them Leary's name. He reveals that Leary bought him the wheelchair and then beat him up severely enough to need it, claiming that Wickland had stolen one of his model designs. He also gives them a nearby address of Leary's. Frank and Al drive to Leary's address and break into the house, not knowing that someone is watching them from a car parked nearby. When they enter the house, Frank is captured and held at gunpoint while Al climbs in. Frank is able to subdue his captor and hold him when another man ( Steve Railsback) enters the house. He IDs himself as David Coppinger of the CIA and reports that he's looking for Leary too because of the fingerprints Frank turned up. He tells them that Leary was trained to be a wetwork specialist, but negative psychological screenings, combined with budget cuts, resulted in his dismissal from the agency. The Secret Service agrees to work with the CIA in apprehending Leary. Coppinger tells them that Leary killed one of his closest friends and shows them pictures of the victim. In a remote location, Leary is testing a new gun he's invented, one that's made of a plastic material. While he shoots it, a couple of hunters find him. He lets them try out his pistol; when one of them offers to buy it, he tells them he needs it to kill the president then shoots them both with it. Al drives Frank home one night and seems distraught. He tells Frank that he has recurring nightmares of the incident on the boat and of the plastic bag being placed over his head. He thinks that transferring off Frank's detail will be a better option. Frank tells Al to toughen up and that he needs him to help with the investigation. Al agrees. When Leary calls again Frank confronts him, telling he knows his name and that he's closing in. Frank also taunts Leary with the knowledge of Leary having killed his own friend. Leary insists that the CIA did not simply fire him, they sent his friend to eliminate him. They turned him into a psychotic killer, and now they want him dead because they \"can't have monsters roaming the countryside.\" The tracing experts finally track Leary to an apartment in Northeast DC. The police move in as Al and Frank arrive, noticing a man fitting Leary's description walking away. Frank and Al chase him along several rooftops; in the process, Al falls behind Frank. Leary jumps a considerable distance from one building to another; when Frank follows, he misses the ledge and hangs off above an alley. Leary appears above him and tells Frank to take his hand or fall. While Frank holds on he draws his pistol and points it at Leary. Leary taunts Frank, telling him that he can shoot him and save the president, thereby falling to his death, or let Leary rescue him. Al arrives, wanting to shoot. Frank continues to point his pistol, seemingly resolved to shoot Leary; Leary deliberately bites down on the muzzle of Frank's pistol, then throws him to safety on a fire escape. Al yells for Leary to freeze and holds him for a few seconds, however, he becomes distracted and Leary opens fire, killing Al. A search of Leary's apartment turns up a scrap of paper with the word \"S.W. KELLUM LA\" on it. It proves to be something of a dead end, with no person of that name in Los Angeles or Louisiana. Later, Frank rides the bus home, looking very distraught. He's at a bar when he gets another call from Leary, who again taunts Frank, saying he killed Al in self-defense. Frank ends the conversation, saying he'll desecrate Leary's grave after he catches and kills him. As Leary proceeds to alter his appearance again, Sam attempts to convince Sargent to cancel the President's upcoming visit to LA. Sargent refuses, as the President cannot afford to lose California's votes, but grudgingly agrees to upgrade security. However, while they are making preparations for the dinner party at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, Franks mistakes an innocent bellboy for a security threat and roughs him up in full view of reporters. Sargent considers this the last straw, and Lilly is forced to remove Frank from the detail. Leary, resuming his alias as James Carney, meets the gentleman in charge of the dinner ceremony, Sanford Riggs (w/ whom he'd spoken previously), who gives him tickets to the dinner. Riggs & Leary/Carney are chatting in the hotel, when Frank calls Riggs over to ID some photos, Leary is unfazed. Lilly talks with Frank about his obsession with Leary and tells him he's not alone and should rely on his fellow agents more. He talks about his failure to protect JFK and how it made him feel. Lily takes his hand and they stand at a window looking out at the LA skyline. Frank talks to another agent who tells him a number to call and that he remembers it as \"ukelele.\" When Frank goes to dial that number, he realizes it's awfully similar to S.W. Kellum. He dials the number and gets South West Savings and Loan, the bank where Leary set up his Carney ID. When he visits the bank, he's told about the murder of the account specialist. The other bank employees try to ascertain new accounts she was working on just prior to her murder and Frank asks them to fax him the list of names. Meanwhile, Leary/Carney enters the dining hall. The president arrives while Leary assembles his composite plastic gun under the table, making small talk with the woman seated next to him. Frank is rushing to the hotel in a cab. When he arrives, there's a fax waiting for him with the new accounts from the bank; he matches the names against the list of contributors and finds James Carney. While Watts accosts him, he gets a seating chart and finds Leary, then rushes toward him just as Leary raises his pistol to shoot the president, arriving just in time to take the bullet. Chaos ensues as the president is spirited away, and Leary switches to a regular gun and takes Frank hostage, dragging him into a glass elevator. Frank is revealed to be wearing a bulletproof vest, and he discovers that the microphone in his collar is still connected to Lilly's frequency. Leary points his gun at Frank, saying that he will not be taken alive, but he's taking Frank with him. Frank tells him to pull the trigger and get it over with, and Lilly correctly deduces that this is an instruction to her. Leary, thinking that Frank is talking to him, demands that Frank acknowledge that he gave him the new sense of purpose he has now. When Frank says to \"aim high,\" Leary finally catches on, and ducks just as the snipers blow out the elevator windows. Frank and Leary fight, and snipers are not able to get a solid bead on either of them. Leary eventually loses his footing and ends up hanging off the railing, with Frank offering him a hand. Leary refuses, and lets himself drop a few dozen stories to his death. Frank, now hailed as a hero, announces his retirement from the Secret Service at the airport; he is too old to be running alongside limousines, and he cannot do undercover work now that his picture has been circulated on every newspaper in the country. Lilly and Frank return to Frank's apartment in D.C. to find a message on his answering machine from Leary. They ignore the message, opting for a quiet moment at the Lincoln Memorial's reflecting pool.",

         "'In the Line of Fire' is one of those Hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit, but although I've seen it a few times, I usually end up sitting through the whole thing again. Why? - It's GOOD! Clint Eastwood is great as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual. The character, Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president. However, the film doesn't make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. He's charming and personable, and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth. The film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts. It's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it!",
         "Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as \"Booth\". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!",
         "In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this riveting film. Malkovich says he's going to kill the president, and he purposely calls Eastwood, and pushes his buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings a cold, but very intelligent mindset to his character. Everything he does, he does for a reason, and he's not shy about killing. Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him. The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel. Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn.",
         "Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.Teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as only he can.Also,John Malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest,I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,\"I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger\".This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often. Top notch movie.",
         "Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is a secret service agent plagued with guilt over the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, while he was on duty. Thirty years later and the current president is entering a re-election campaign, but he is receiving death threats; and Horrigan has been called in to assist in what should be a routine research operation. John Malkovich plays the professional assassin and master of disguise who is tracking the president, and using the past he begins to torture Horrigan in a psychological duel of cat and mouse. Malkovich, Eastwood and Rene Russo all give wonderful performances in this top notch thriller. The direction is excellent and the entire picture is charged with tension and intrigue throughout. A must see for thriller fans 8/10",
         "Clint Eastwood could do no wrong in the early Nineties. Hot on the heels of Unforgiven, he teamed up with The Perfect Storm director Wolfgang Petersen for one of the best thrillers of the decade - In the Line of Fire. Imagine a cross between The Day of the Jackal and The Bodyguard and you get the idea. Hollywood's craggiest leading man plays Frank Horrigan, a troubled bodyguard assigned to protect the US president against a psychopathic assassin. John Malkovich delivers a stunning performance as the man on the end of the trigger and acclaimed German director Petersen directs with such skill, Eastwood even asked his advice when he came to direct A Perfect World. Clint was 63 when he made this and brought a lifetime of experience to the role of a world weary Secret Service agent haunted by the fact he failed to save President Kennedy from the fatal bullet. The clever use of a doctored photo by Hollywood whiz kids shows the actor/director stood at the side of JFK. A nice touch which is well worth looking out for. To be honest, ITLOF is a cliched thriller, the sort of story which crops up most weeks as a glossy, no brain offering on Channel 5. However, both director and stars took the well worn material and gave it a fresh spin, upping the tension several notches with each passing scene, resulting in a spectacular finale which is great value for money. Rene Russo is so good she could play the part in her sleep. The former model adds a degree of mature charm to her role of an agent who Horrigan believes is mere `window dressing' for the department. As with all of Wolfgang's movies, believability is everything. A rare degree of authenticity was achieved during the crowd scenes when the German film-maker integrated his fictitious President with the crowds from the Clinton and Bush election campaign. The cost? A cool $4million. The script had been knocking around Hollywood for a decade before it was dusted down and given a green light. It was originally to star Dustin Hoffman (who signed up for Petersen's follow up, Outbreak). British director Michael Apted (The World is Not Enough) was due to direct the Hoffman version, but when David Puttnam took over as the head of Columbia in 1987, the movie was put on hold. Producer Jeff Apple (a man more known in the trade for his interactive shopping shows than films) brought in Jeff Maguire to polish up the script. The idea of Horrigan as an agent who failed to stop JFK's untimely death gave the movie a twist that Hollywood execs found delicious. Before long, there was a feeding frenzy over the new, improved script and eventually, Rob Reiner's Castle Rock company snapped it up for a million dollars with Clint Eastwood on board. Petersen had wanted Harrison Ford, but eventually cast him as the President in Air Force One (which you may remember was the film of the week a couple of weeks ago). As any Clint fan knows, he's a jazz fan - a passion shared by Horrigan in what seemed to be a tailor made role adapted for old Mr Squinty after he signed on the dotted line. However, Frank's love of piano and jazz was already on the page - a happy accident which helped turn Horrigan into one of Clint's most likeable big screen characters. Top drawer stuff.",
         "This is another of Eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with \"The Gauntlet,\" \"Firefox,\" and so forth. Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one, he's taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; it's above average. Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove his family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself \"Booth,\" who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project, but he does rather well, less robotic than usual. And he does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He's tested again halfway through this movie. He is hanging from the roof of a tall building, grasping Booth's hand, and he pulls his pistol and points it at Booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. If he does, of course, he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIA-trained murderer, but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. And Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about his failure to save the president in Dallas. \"If I'd have reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me.\" It's underplayed, but his voice chokes slightly, his eyes water, and his lip trembles. It's one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that might properly be called \"moving.\" We know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that he doesn't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they \"carved a nation out of the wilderness.\" Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?) It's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It isn't true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is marvelous. Talk about disillusioned. Okay, he can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but he's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson, as the chief White House aid, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is something less. In every film he's been in, he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder. The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in \"Das Boot,\" which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful cross-cutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. Interrupted, Clint lies back on the bed and sighs, \"Now I have to put all that stuff back on again.\" Well written and worth watching.",
         "A great performance by Clint Eastwood and particularly John Malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date. Malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it's incredible. Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan, an aged and cynical Secret Service Agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments. But one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat on the President by a \"wacko\". As fate would have it Horrigan has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the White House. As Horrigan dives deeper into \"Booth's\" world he attracts the bad guy's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him. Horrigan was JFK's top agent and present in Dallas, Texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened. Now he feels it's up to him to stop the current Head of State from joining the list of dead Presidents. But this killer has turned the tables on Horrigan and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game. Who will win? Who will die? It's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleon-like enemy who can get to anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good a nail biter as any.",
         "\"In the Line Of Fire\" is an expertly crafted thriller that has a fantastic climax. The film starts building suspense a half hour into the movie and it doesn't let up until the final scene. Clint Eastwood does exceptional work as does John Malkovich as the villian, the rest of the cast turns in good performances as well. Director Wolfgang Peterson knows how to build suspense and he does it extremely well, he also directed another top notch suspense thriller \"Air Force One.\"",
         "'In The Line Of Fire' is a film that sounds better than it really is. It has all the prerequisites for an exciting thriller- an oddball assassin planning to kill the President, a Secret Service agent determined to stop him, a long cat & mouse game between them, a beautiful woman the agent has an affair with... all tried and true plot devices. The Secret Service agent, Frank Horrigan, is a hard-headed loner, the last surviving member of the detail that guarded John Kennedy when he was shot and killed. All these potentially exciting elements never really come together, and the film has a cut-and-dried, paint-by-the-numbers feel to it. The various subplots come across as clichéd; for instance, we instinctively know, early on, that Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) will fall out of favor with his superiors. We know he and the beautiful Secret Service agent Lily Raines (Rene Russo), even though she apparently can't stand him, will have an affair. We know the nutcase assassin (John Malkovich) will come within a hair's breadth of killing the President. And of course we know Horrigan will prevent it, on duty or not. Granted, the movie delivers all this competently; Eastwood, as always, is fun to watch and some of his dry dialogue is effective. But an air of the routine permeates the film. There is nothing particularly scary about Mitch Leary; he's more annoying than anything in his phone calls to Horrigan, when he taunts the agent for failing to protect Kennedy all those years ago. Nothing in the film is very subtle or mysterious. It is suggested that Horrigan is too old for his job and sure enough in the next scene, he is running alongside the presidential limo, obligingly huffing and puffing to show his age. The film wants to be a cross between 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'The Manchurian Candidate' but has none of those films' layered textures or rich characterizations. It plays like a decently produced TV movie and, taken on that level, is moderately entertaining."

         "Frank Horrigan is a secret service agent who keeps thinking back to November 22, 1963, when, as a hand-picked agent by President Kennedy, he became one of the few agents to have lost a President to an assassin when Kennedy died. Now, former CIA assassin Mitch Leary is stalking the current President, who is running for re-election. Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan, telling him of his plans to kill the President. Leary plans to kill the president because Leary feels betrayed by the government -- Leary was removed from the CIA, and the CIA is now trying to have him killed. After talking to Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty, working with fellow secret service agent Lilly Raines. Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around, and he's more than willing to take a bullet. White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent refuses to alter the President's itinerary, while Horrigan's boss, Secret Service Director Sam Campagna, is supportive of Horrigan. As the election gets closer, Horrigan begins to doubt his own abilities, especially when Horrigan's colleague Al D'Andrea is killed by Leary. But Horrigan may be the only one who can stop Leary.",

         "Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan is a fairly successful agent working for the president, yet the guilt of not being able to save President Kennedy back in the 60's still haunts him. When a lunatic assassin named Booth aka Mitch Leary begins to haunt and torment Frank with phone calls about his failure to save Kennedy and the threats to assassinate the president, Frank must take action and protect the presidents at all costs-even if it causes him humiliation. Does Frank have what it takes to take a bullet?",
         "Frank Horrigan is a Secret Service Agent. He currently does mostly undercover work. He goes to check on a report about a person who is threatening the life of the President. When he goes to the man's apartment, he finds clippings and photos of various assassinations throughout history. When he does a background check, he discovers that the man's identity is false. So he goes back to the apartment to get him, but when he goes in there, he finds the apartment cleaned out except for a photo of him when he was in Dallas, November 1963, protecting Kennedy. Later he gets a phone call from the man and tells him that he plans to kill the President and is daring Frank to stop him. When Frank reports to his superiors, he finds that there are some people like the agent in charge of protecting the President and the Chief of Staff, who think that Frank is letting his failure to protect Kennedy cloud his judgement. But as Frank chases him down, he discovers that he is not dealing with a nut but with a well organized individual.",
