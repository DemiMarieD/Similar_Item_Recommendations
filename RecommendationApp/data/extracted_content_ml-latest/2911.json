         "My immediate impression after seeing this film for the first time (and any really good film needs to be seen at least twice) was that at last here was another little masterpiece to add to the very limited cinematographical treasure troves produced by Spain in the last quarter of a century. 'El Abuelo' stands very well alongside `El Sur' (1982) and `Los Santos Inocentes' (1984), these two also being adapted from novels. I cannot help thinking that Garci is at his best when with the help of Valcárcel he adapts a story from real Spanish literature. As perhaps the most prestigious and prize-winning Spanish director (we shall pass over Almodóvar and his commercially orientated light entertainment), having won at Hollywood, Montreal, and Spain's own Goya prize several times, he has produced some memorable films and TV series (Historias del Otro Lado - Stories from the Other Side), mostly because he has that acute eye for capturing every detail as he shoots his scenes. He knows how to use his actors, and never better than in `El Abuelo'. The leading actors bring sincere interpretations, full of feeling, adding beauty to the situations being developed. The film is also a little tribute to Rafael Alonso, who died without seeing the finished film: his life ended with the hugely memorable part of an unpresuming private home teacher to the two little girls - Dolly and Nelly - one of whom is not really Don Rodrigo's granddaughter. Fernán Gómez is of course perfect, as he has been in most of his films in recent years, and Agustín González has at last played his best rôle in the whole of his acting career. Don Rodrigo returns from the Americas where he lost a fortune, to find out which of the two girls was due to his daughter-in-law's unfaithfulness. The novel itself is `costumbrista' as is also the novel by Concha Espina, `El Junco', which deals with a similar situation. Manuel Balboa once again has been exquisite in choosing his music and I must mention the sumptuous photography by Raúl Pérez Cubero, beautifully, lovingly captured in the countryside and around the grand old house, worth any prizes that may be floating around out there.....But I do not believe in prizes: they mostly exist only to perpetuate themselves. `El Abuelo' does not need any prizes - it stands up on its own merits: simply a wonderful film telling a story with simplicity and feeling.",
         "Wonderful, lovely, warm, rich story of an impoverished, very old, Spanish aristocrat (El Abuelo - the grandfather) whose son is dead, and whose daughter-in-law has two daughters. One of these granddaughters is the son of El Abuelo, and one is the product of an affair - which has highly affronted the old man's honor. And he wants to find out which is which. Ultimately, he discovers he loves them both, and with a little help from another wonderful character, decides that love is more important than honor. Absolutely terrific. Leisurely pace, good cinematography complement story line and excellent performances. (In Spanish with subtitles).****",
         "EL ABUELO (The Grandfather) began as a 1954 novel by Benito Pérez Galdós and was adapted for the screen by writer/director José Luis Garci in 1998, a year when it was nominated for Best Foreign Film Oscar. It is a period piece of epic proportions, an immensely beautiful work both visually and emotionally, that assures the film's becoming a beloved standard in the cinematic library. Don Rodrigo de Arista Potestad (Fernando Fernán Gómez, the brilliant Peruvian actor from such films as 'Butterfly', 'Belle Epoque', 'All About My Mother, etc) is a crusty old aristocrat who has been in America for the Gold Rush who returns to Spain (a small town of Jerusa) when his son dies. He concern is about a letter his son wrote to him that one of his two granddaughters was sired by another man, an artist, and the old man is determined to find out which one of the granddaughters should rightfully inherit is name and his money. He arrives to meet Dolly (Cristina Cruz) and Nelly (Cristina Cruz) and their beautiful mother Doña Lucrecia (Cayetana Guillén Cuervo), a woman who has survived emotional hardships but has generously favored the small town with gifts while giving her daughters in home schooling by the intelligent, sensitive Don Pío Coronado (Rafael Alonso) who has been forsaken by his own family. The once butler of the home Senén Corchado (Agustín González) has been freed to become an oily capitalist, eager to squander the family money. Don Rodrigo (Abuelo) challenges the family to maintain the honor of his name, becomes fast friends with Don Pío, and the two set about to discover whether it is Dolly or Nelly that is the true bloodline granddaughter. The manner in which the investigation proceeds includes the warm relationship Abuelo forms with the girls, the way he decides the future of Lucrecia, and the bonding he forms with Pío. It is Pío who challenges Abuelo with the question of which is more important, honor or love, and it is this question that suffuses the resolution of the story with surprises and with extraordinary tenderness. The actors are all superb with special kudos to Fernando Fernán Gómez and Rafael Alonso. The cinematography of the coastlines of Spain is breathtakingly beautiful and the manner in which Raúl Pérez Cubero frames his images glows. The original musical score is by Manuel Balboa whose love theme is hauntingly played by both piano and orchestra: the moments of music by Satie (Gymnopédie) and Elgar (the Nimrod variation from Enigma Variations) are beautifully performed by the Madrid Orchestra under the baton of Ángel Gil Ordóñez. The film is long (well over two hours) and there are some synchrony defects in the spoken soundtrack (?dubbing for the granddaughters' voices?), but these are minor flaws in an eloquently beautiful film. In Spanish with English subtitles. Grady Harp",
         "This in a movie version of Perez Galdos's novel . I mean you got to understand the historical context where it happens. There are several reasons to watch this movie. The first rate performance of the Spanish actor Fernando Fernan Gomez (actor,writer, theater director, drama writer,etc.), a national treasure . His performance in this movie won a Goya ( the Spanish's academy awards ) . The 2 performances offered by Fernan Gomez in \"El Abuelo\" and \"La lengua de las mariposas \" can be counted among the best in recent years .This actor is admired by Banderas,Bardem ,etc. Then we have Rafael Alonso as El Abuelo's friend .Another magnificent actor .All the cast really is very well chosen. Garci direct the movie with a strong hand , caring a lot about the acting . If only for the performances it will be worth to spend your time watching this movie and remember the story was devised by one of the best universal writers ever . Your own university will tell you that...",
         "Benito Pérez Galdós is considered (with Miguel de Cervantes) the best Spanish writer and, in fact, if you read one of his books I assure you'll read more. Adapted by lots of directors, like Luis Buñuel, now was the time of the greatest Spanish director alive (José Luis Garci) to film one of the prettiest dramas ever made. And for \"The Grandfather\" José Luis Garci had the help of a genius (not only an actor, also a writer, director, ...): Fenando Fernán Gómez, his name is a legend alive. So with the text of Galdós, the art of Garci and the character of Fernán Gómez what can you have? A piece of art.",
         "Or does one have to? The matter is posed to an old man (El Abuelo aka the Grandfather) returning penniless from intrigues abroad to the village where he was once a respected aristocrat. In search of the truth about his two beautiful granddaughters, the sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet old man is met with insincerity and chicanery. Some may view the film as plodding and uneventful. However, those with an understanding of the importance family honor to an old world aristocrat or the meaning of love to a disenfranchised old man will likely be captivated by its subtle charms. The old Spanish architecture, pastoral beauty, and sumptuous cinematography should appeal to all.",
         "Oscar winner Jose Luis Garci repeats his classical formula in this adaptation from a novel by Perez Galdos. The story is set in Asturias, in the north of Spain, in the 1900's. The film is about honor, reputation, friendship, love and hate. As many films by Garci, the cinematography and the score makes the film more comfortable to follow, although there are scenes that can be so slow, that they can bore a bit. But all the cast, including Fernan Gomez and Rafael Alonso, the landscape and the story itself, make this film so attractive to those who love classical films, that it must be seen. And pay attention to the magnificent first 7 minutes, with no cuts, and the camera following calmly to the characters. ¡It is genial!",
         "This is a period piece bringing together some of the greatest writers, directors, and actors of the Spanish theater. Benito Pérez Galdós' novel was first made into film in 1925, five years after his death. Galdos has written many works that have made it to film, and the fact that one is redone is testament to his writing skill. José Luis Garci is one of Spain's greatest writers and directors, and has many shelves full of awards to prove it. Fernando Fernán Gómez, who plays the lead in this film, also has shelves full of awards for his acting (over 200 roles), writing, and directing skills. He plays a man who returns from Peru determined to find his rightful heir between the daughters of his philandering daughter-in-law (Cayetana Guillén Cuervo). This is not an easy task as he is broke and his daughter-in-law has the whole town on her side because of the money her husband left her. The scene where he called them all out was magnificent! The scene where his granddaughter Dolly (Cristina Cruz) laid down the law was breathtaking. This was a beautiful film that my poor words cannot even begin to describe.",
         "The Grandfather (1999) El Abuelo This film directed by José Luis Garci, who won an Academy Award in 1983 for \"To Begin Again,\". Based on Benito Perez Galdos novel, the film that comments on how families are built by love, not blood. Love is the only bond that can hold a family together, & this movie proves it. When an aging, bitter, turn-of-the-century Spanish aristocrat (Fernando Fernán-Gómez) learns that his son has died, he travels back to his family estate in Spain to confront his detested daughter-in-law (Cayetana Guillén Cuervo), whom he suspects of bearing him an illegitimate granddaughter. But which one is it? Which granddaughter will gain his blessing, & which his curse? This once powerful and still proud patriarch finds it hard to deal with the shameful and humiliating treatment he receives from the townsfolk. As his ego is battered, he slowly mellows. His friendship with Pio Coronado (Rafael Alonso) improves his mental health.(the old teacher who has had serious thoughts about suicide). In the last stages of his life, the Count learns a thing or two about time, love, friendship, and blood ties. He is free at last to cave in to the impulses and desires of his heart. While the film is a deeply touching story & contains very lush beautiful cinematography this movies moves at a snail's pace & is very long at 145 minutes. The great Spanish character actor Fernando Fernan-Gomez (Belle Epoque) won a Spanish Goya award for his part in this film as aged Count of Albrit. His creaky performance is a standout; excellent \u0096well really- fantastic he is in this role characterizing The Grandfather. The film is just a little too slow & constrained. In addition to the strong performances, the film's cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The lush & verdant Spanish landscape is the backdrop, the rural scenery sweeps of Spain is just a beauty to behold. The stunning cinematography literally makes turn-of-the-century Spain appear as if it's just been stolen from an famous summer painting. In 1999, The Grandfather deserved its the Spanish nomination for an Academy Award as Best Foreign Language Film. It also received a dozen Spanish Goya nominations. This is the third time Galdos' novel has been brought to the screen, & this one is well worth the effort to watch. My main comment would be how poor the (Spanish) dubbing was. It was a very bad choice to have the two small girls voices dubbed in by fake sounding adults who do not sound like a child at all. There were consistent problems with the voice dubbing & synchronizing throughout the movie. I watched the movie in Spanish with English Subtitles. I hope this film get a wider audience than it had in 1999 it is really almost an epic of a movie and extremely beautiful and interesting. The Grandfather magically transports us to a time and a way of life that have long since disappeared. However it is a tad boring as it is long and slow but art film lovers hang in there and watch this !! I still liked the movie a lot!",
         "This perceptible drama is based on Benito Perez Galdos's (author of Episodios Nacionales) novel and adapted by Horacio Valcarcel. The countess Lucrecia (Cayetana Guillen Cuervo) along with his two daughters(Alicia Rozas, Cristina Cruz) return to City of Jerusia. But also the grandfather (Fernando Fernan Gomez)goes back Spain after traveling America looking for the Dorado, but he is now ruined. The old man wants reckoning , because his son died and left a will stating which one of the two daughters is an illegitimate little girl . Later on, the elderly count is obligated by the Mayor(Fernando Guillen, Cayetana Guillen's father), the priest(Francisco Algora), the administrator(Agustin Gonzalez) and doctor(Juan Calot) to remain at a Monastery led by the prior(Francisco Piquer) but Don Rodrigo escapes. This is a thought-provoking drama filmed with great sensitivity and feeling. It's an intelligent and touching story although sometimes is slow moving and tiring but is finely developed with sense of style and sensibility. In the picture are treated ethics and morals themes developed with great sense of fairness and ductility.Excellent acting by Fernando Fernan Gomez as an embittered man who will must face the traumatic truth and choose between honor and love. Special mention to Rafael Alonso as unfortunate elderly man who is mistreated by his six daughters . Besides exceptional and awesome cinematography by Raul Perez Cubero as is reflected on the marvelous outdoors of the countryside and brilliant interiors . Wonderful musical score by Manuel Balboa and the symphonic orchestra of Madrid with haunting leitmotif. Well filmed on marvelous locations as Niembro, Llanes, Pola De Lena, Church of Valdedios and Santa Cristina Lena (Asturias) and Monastery of Santa Maria Vid (Aranda Duero). Spectacular production design by Gil Parrondo who formerly achieved two Oscars (Patton, Nicholas and Alexandra). The motion picture is accurately directed by Jose Luis Garci (El Crack I, II, Luz Domingo) who won one Academy Award for ¨Volver a Empezar¨. Rating : Better than average and well worth seeing. For these reasons is essential and indispensable watching and is better than first version titled ¨La Duda¨ by Rafael Gil with Fernando Rey (Fernando Fernan Gomez role), Analia Gade (Cayetana Guillen character),Pilar Bardem, and again Rafael Alonso as Senen Corbacho (Agustin Gonzalez role)."
