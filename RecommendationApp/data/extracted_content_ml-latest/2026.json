      "synopsis": "Steve Clark (James Marsden) is a high school senior whose family moves to Cradle Bay, a picturesque coastal town. Steve soon befriends three outcast students, Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl), U.V. (Chad E. Donella), and Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes). Gavin tries to tell Steve that he believes there is something evil about the \"Blue Ribbons\"students taking part in a program led by the school psychologist, Dr. Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood). Steve is understandably skeptical. The following day at lunch, Gavin walks in looking like a Blue Ribbon. When Steve tries to confront Gavin, he gets punched in the stomach for his impertinence. Now Steve and Rachel must try and save the rest of the school before it's too late. They find a disc that Gavin hid for them in the boiler room, before his \"transformation,\" which tells them about the club. During this, Steve also befriends Dorian, the school janitor, who appears to be mentally handicapped and hunts rats for the city. Dorian demonstrates a device which emits a soft, high pitched whine that is supposed to be innocuous buts annoying to rats, which is an abysmal failure. Steve discovers that Dorian is actually highly intelligent, and carries high classical literature pieces with him, and that he's hiding because he wishes to be left alone. During an encounter where a Blue Ribbon assualts Dorian, the rat device goes off, and immediately sends the student into a psychotic fit, driving him away. They try and find out what has been happening to these kids, which leads them to a mental hospital called Bishop Flats. They learn that this mind control used to make depressed and awkward teens become perfect so they can function properly in life, but the programming has some glitches that lead to momentary relapses. Also at Bishop Flats, they find Caldicott's daughter, Betty (Julie Patzwald), who spends her time repeating the same phrase: \"Meet the musical little creatures that hide among the flowers\". When Rachel and Steve return, they plan to get out of town along with Steve's little sister, Lindsay (Katharine Isabelle), but when they get back, Steve's parents (Terry David Mulligan and Susan Hogan) reveal they had him signed up for the program. Steve and Lindsay try to get out but they get ambushed by a group of blue ribbons waiting for them. They drag Steve and Rachel to the programming center, but Steve escapes and rescues Rachel. They try to get out of town again with Lindsay and U.V., but the Blue Ribbons and Caldicott are waiting for them near the ferry out of town. When hope seems lost, the janitor of the school drives up, his car hooked up with sonic devices that scramble the mind control tech inside the blue ribbons' heads. They chase after him and try to destroy the devices, but, having been fatally wounded by Caldicott, he drives off a cliff with the blue ribbons on it. This leads to a final battle between Steve and Caldicott, which Steve wins by kicking Caldicott off the cliff. Steve and Rachel then leave town. The final scene shows a classroom in an urban high school with kids playing loud music, cursing, and acting up. They are informed that they have a new teacher. The well-kept sub turns around, and it's Gavin, with the blue ribbon \"twinkle\" still active in his eye.",

         "I was a little disappointed when I left this film, but not because of the overall result. I was disappointed because of the wonderful way in which the story was laid out and unfolded itself in the beginning, then seemed to fall away during its 2nd act. The reverse theme of bad kids turning good was fascinating, and the paranoid performance by Nick Stahl was worth watching and intrigued me. But then, as soon as Stahl was converted, the film started to fall apart. For one Stahl was the only character I found to be truly worth watching. Marsden and Holmes were just two pretty faces noticeably void of much talent; I never believed the two as a couple, and I never found any reason to invest myself in hoping for their well-being other the fact they were the lesser of two evils. But most noticeably, I grew disinterested because of the change in aim by the makers. The first half of the film, which by itself I would have given an 8 or 9 out of 10, was more of a grown-up horror movie, where the situation and plot rather than actions dictated the fear of the audience. But after Stahl disappears to the dark side, the film changed into a teen slasher film almost, where blood, violence and screaming is used in a vain attempt to induce fright. This 2nd half was worth a 4 or 5 out of 10. The length did not bother me as much as others (I've seen plenty of effective movies that were under 90 minutes). What bothered me more was the lack of development in some key plot points. I think the entire conspiracy plot behind the conversion of the teens needed to be fleshed out much more, characters needed to be drawn more distinctly, and so on. So I balance out the two halves and come up with a 6 out of 10. Worth renting, but could have been something special.",
         "Disturbing Behavior is a difficult film for a serious movie critic to defend, primarily because of a long-standing prejudice to both the teen and horror genres. Granted, few teen movies are designed to treat their subjects with any degree of seriousness. And of all the film genres, horror is kept alive with only the slightest bit of effort, accompanied by even slighter expectations. But director David Nutter tackles both these obstacles in a rare attempt to sophisticate Hollywood's offerings to teen audiences and bring dignity to the maligned horror genre. Despite a screenplay written contrary to his vision, Nutter succeeds in creating a dramatic, moody, and entertaining sci-fi/horror yarn far more difficult to dismiss than its contemporary equivalents. That is, until MGM destroyed it. It's important to note that the version of Disturbing Behavior being analyzed here is the director's cut, which is not the version released in theaters. Nutter's cut isn't available commercially, but if you watch the DVD's considerable amount of deleted footage and the original ending, you can see just how devastating the studio's changes were. After suffering the loss of his older brother, Steve and his family relocate to Cradle Bay, where some of the kids at school aren't quite themselves these days. With the help of friends Rachel (Katie Holmes) and Gavin (Nick Stahl), Steve discovers that a local doctor, Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood), is conspiring with parents to lobotomize their teens in order to create \"good boys and girls\", all of whom become members of the school's Blue Ribbon elitist clique. Caldicott's experiments prevent the Blue Ribbons from sexual impulses and mold them into academic achievers that spend a great deal of their time trying to recruit others to \"the program\". Unfortunately, the experiments don't always work and trouble is at hand, especially when Steve's parents sign him up. Scott Rosenberg, the screenwriter of the film, later expressed great disappointment with Nutter's handling of the material. Rosenberg, the screenwriter of Con-Air and Beautiful Girls, never intended his script to be treated as dramatically or realistically as Nutter executed it. Instead, it was supposed to be more \"hip\" and \"cool\", allegedly without being mired down by characterization or atmosphere. This seems to indicate that the screenwriter, like the studio executives, had low ambitions with the material, planning to do nothing more than churn out another cheap horror film that insults the intelligence of its target audience. David Nutter, a veteran director of The X-Files, saw the potential in Rosenberg's script and acted on it. He started by casting three of the most talented young actors in Hollywood. James Marsden breaks the stereotype that models can't be good actors by delivering a subtle, restrained performance as Steve. Katie Holmes has a few opportunities to demonstrate her abilities as well. As the socially outcast Rachel, Holmes combines a defensive posture with an underlying desire to connect. Nick Stahl has the meatiest part, playing the cynical Gavin, a critic of all the other cliques at school. Gavin's quiet omnipotence is colored by a dry sense of humor much needed in the film. Other notable performances include William Sadler as Newberry, the school's janitor. Newberry is a little off kilter, squinting, grumbling, and hell-bent on ridding the world of all rats. Another interesting character who almost steals the show is U.V. (Chad E. Donella), Gavin's reticent albino friend who spends most of the film sitting at Gavin's side and uttering only a few syllables. Nutter's style is very much the signature X-Files style, dark, steamy, creepy, and purposeful. To achieve this, Nutter enlisted an X-Files photographer (John S. Bartley), the X-Files composer (Mark Snow), several X-Files actors (including Steve Railsback, aka Duane Barry), and key production personnel. The result is a movie that feels like an X-Files spin-off, with a subdued ambiance that washes over you and gets under your skin. Nutter commissioned one of the more remarkable opening title sequences in recent film history, one that serves as a cinematic prelude to the lobotomy procedure later in the film - a rapidly-edited montage of happy images and words designed to hypnotize and brainwash Caldicott's victims. If Disturbing Behavior should be criticized, it certainly loses points in its third act, one that falls dangerously close to cliché, with Steve becoming more the archetypal hero figure in a predictable and unimaginative showdown with Caldicott and the Blue Ribbons. Since the third act of any story is largely plot (character development is usually pretty well wrapped-up by then), I imagine Nutter had little to work with from Rosenberg's original screenplay. That the first two acts were so emotionally engaging is the result of Nutter's persistence and better judgment. It's too bad that MGM freaked out after a test screening in Texas and thought they could improve their numbers by shortening the film and forcing it into the cookie-cutter shape of the average, low-achieving horror flick. I champion this film because of its thematic content and its ideology. Like many of my favorite films (RoboCop, Dances with Wolves, Rebel Without a Cause), it deals with characters in crises of identity, trying to become or remain whole, and connect with each other. Equally interesting to me are the notions of sexual repression as a sign of perfection, man playing God, parents' willingness to medically alter their children, and human unwillingness to face loss. Nutter's bold vision for this material, his ability to cull it from a screenplay where it was not just dormant, but banished, makes his director's cut a remarkable achievement. Add in the exemplary performances of Marsden, Stahl, and Holmes, and that special X-Files flare, and I've got something I can really sink my teeth into. - Scott Schirmer",
         "After the suicide of the teenager Allen Clark (Ethan Embry), his family decides to move from Chicago to the quiet Cradle Bay Island seeking a peaceful life for the siblings Steve (James Marsden) and Lindsay Clark (Katharine Isabelle). When Steve joins the local high-school, the outcast Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) befriends Steve and introduces his also rejected friend Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes) to the newcomer. Gavin exposes to Steve in the refectory the punks, the nerds and the different tribes of the school and he defends the weird theory that a sinister force changes the behavior of the annoyingly perfect \"Blue Ribbons\", a group of good students that wear identical jackets and gather in the Yogurt Shoppe. Further he tells that he had witnessed the blue ribbon Andy Efkin (Tobias Mehler) killing their schoolmate Mary Jo (Natassia Malthe) that is missing and the local Officer Cox (Steve Railsback) covering the murder. Steve does not believe on Gavin words, but when his friend is submitted to the treatment of Dr. Edgar Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood) and immediately changes his behavior, joining the Blue Ribbons, Steve and Rachel decides to investigate the mystery discovering the dark secret of the perfect behavior. \"Disturbing Behavior\" has an intriguing beginning, with a murder and a group of former troublemakers and potheads transformed in perfect students, like in the classic \"Invasion of Body Snatchers\". However, when the paranoid Gavin changes his behavior, the plot becomes silly and flawed, and the conclusion is awful. I saw this movie for the first time on 25 March 2000 and I keep my original opinion that this movie is reasonable, but could be great with improvements in the second-half of the story. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): \"Comportamento Suspeito\" (\"Suspicious Behavior\")",

Katie Holmes is totally wasted in a supporting role. Excessive pre-release cutting damaged what could have been one of the best teen horror films of the 90's. This could have been a very emotional, haunting and even touching film with a disturbing ending. What is left now is a teen driven, cold, and chainsaw edited flick with a poor gimmicky ending. Still some signs of intelligent intentions shine through, the performances for the most part are unusually good, and the director does a fine job of building up a paranoid, crazed sense of atmosphere. Rated R; Violence, Sexual Situations, Nudity, Drug Use, Drinking, and Profanity all involving teenagers. The original cut would merit a * * *1/2 rating.",
         "This is basically a modern take on the Sepford children but with added sexual content and more graphic detail. The premise is this.After the death of his brother ,young teen Steven Clark, played by James Marsden, X Men,moves to the seemingly innocent town of Cradle Bay with his family.At first everything seems normal.The children are typical teens but when they get a red light in their eyes they become totally different. Steven makes friends with a weird group of outsiders including Katie Holmes who warn him that something is going on.He remains sceptical till he gets beaten up by a group of the teens and realises that something is terribly wrong. In this film you are never quite sure who is what and look out for the seemingly retarded janitor whose role is pivotal in the outcome of the movie. This film reminded me of the film The Faculty in many respects but wasn't as good. I saw this at 9.00 on channel 5 so it was probably cut but it still an enjoyable romp into the world of mind control and the scene in the hospital sticks in the memory. The cast did well but William sadler, as the janitor, did especially well and James Marsden and Katie Holmes show good chemistry. This film is not in my top ten fave movies but good for an hour and a half of escapism. Good film but the twist can be seen a mile away. My score 8/10",
         "Steve and his family move from Chicago to Cradle Bay (which based on a road sign is outside Seattle). We later learn his brother Allen died, and that has something to do with the move. At his new high school, he meets Gavin and U. V., who take drugs and listen to depressing heavy metal music. Gavin has the hots for Lorna, but she's a Blue Ribbon, a member of a group of students that help out in the community and help each other study. Gavin wants nothing to do with these people. It turns out the Blue Ribbons aren't as goody-goody as they first appear. To call them snobs is an understatement. Anyone who isn't a member is treated like dirt, but of course new members are accepted all the time. The organization had its beginning with a deadly car wreck, and Dr. Edgar Caldicott played a large role in getting it started. This film reminds me of an episode of 'Smallville', except only the villains (who appear to be the good kids) have the super powers. Or maybe they're not actually super powers. This film had its own version of Belle Reve, where all the Smallville freaks seemed to end up eventually. Also, there was the loud alternative rock music in some scenes and the pleasant classical-style background music in others. I really liked the music in Roscoe's Yogurt Shoppe and in the asylum (I'm referring to Barry Manilow). I actually found the bad kids appealing in this movie--Gavin, Rachel, and Dickie in particular. The real standout character, though, is the demented janitor Mr. Newberry, who comes across as if Gilbert Gottfried had played the Bill Murray role in 'Caddyshack'. Another good though brief performance came from Julie Patzwald as Betty Caldicott. This was a little on the violent side, but I guess for the type of movie it wasn't too bad. A lot of bad language seemed to have been cleaned up for TV. And I'm not sure whether this is something that was edited out, but in one scene, the position of a girl's head relative to her date suggests something that happened in Bill Clinton's White House. It wasn't a classic by any means, but it wasn't too bad.",
         "The makers of \"Disturbing Behavior\" proudly call this a horror film, but anyone who has the slightest bit of experience with this (usually) wonderful genre will only label it as childish, pitiful nonsense. The plot is obviously stolen from \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", only it's severely simplified so that fans of dud high-school shows like \"Beverly Hills 90210\" can get some thrills out of it. The evil school psychiatrist (!) of Cradle Bay island plants computer chips into the brains of mediocre students and, overnight, they mutate into grade-A model adolescents. New arrival Steve Clark teams up with pothead Gavin and hottie Rachel to prevent this from happening to them. Not a single storyline in the script is adequately explained (the reason behind Steve's brother's suicide, the flaws of the 'good behavior'-program, the connection with rodents, etc...) and whenever the film threatens to become too incoherent, the camera quickly zooms in on Katie Holmes sexy belly in order to distract your attention. The attempts to create suspense and mystery are laughable, the use of clichés and stereotypes is dreadful and many lines are vaguely offensive. The climax is hilarious, though. Good actors, like William Sadler and Steve Railsback, make fools out of themselves in the supportive cast. High-school horror was inexplicably popular near the end of the 1990, but this film is the absolute low point of them all. Better watch \"The Faculty\"...or even \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\".",
         "I caught this film on a late night TV slot (around 1:00). Since it was an evening of surprisingly watchable movies up until then (Michael Chrictons 'Runaway' & Clint Eastwoods 'White hunter, black heart') this mix of teeny horror and x-files type paranoia sci-fi was just the kind of icing on the cake I needed before finally calling it a night. Even though it obviously suffers from some plot holes and studio interference, I must say that I still found it much better than other late 90's 'Scream' influenced (and included) teen horror revival stuff. Sci-fi element was, even though lacking in any deeper explanation, believable enough, especially the part with problems arising due to puberty related hormone/neurotransmitter surges (i.e. Lorna's sexual turn violent outburst at Steve's house) etc. All in all, not really a shining example of cinematic art but still bearable enough for a late night entertainment.",
         "I first saw this movie on TV and missed the first 15 minutes. I thought the movie was great so I bought the DVD and haven't stopped watching it yet. Every actor is perfect for their roles (although William Sadler's accent is ridiculous), every location looks like it was created to be in this movie (several locations are in \"The 6th Day\") and the story was great. Although basically just a rehash of the Stepford Wives, this movie is set for for teen audiences and director David Nutter makes the story seem completely original. The story is this: A boy and his family move to Cradle Bay to try and escape the memories of his brother, who committed suicide. When the boy, Steve (played by X-Men star James Marsden) starts school he quickly makes friends with outcast Gavin (Nick Stahl of T3), who explains to Steve that something fishy is going on as his friends have traded in their sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyles to join the Blue Ribbons, the straight-A good boy jocks and cheerleaders. Gavin then introduces Steve to his friend Rachael (the talented Katie Holmes) who he falls in love with. Inevitably, Gavin becomes a Blue Ribbon. Steve and Rachael then try to find out what is going on and how to stop it while trying to stop themselves becoming part of the group. This is a great story of love and paranoia. The lunch room \"Freak Roll Call\" is a scene not to be missed. The only problem is the way the film has been edited. On the DVD are 10 additional scenes which expand on such stories such as Steve's parents fearing he will commit suicide like his brother (which is irrelevent in the theatrical cut) and expansions on the paranoia. There is also an alternate ending that shows us an exciting final confrontation between Steve and Gavin. This movie was rushed into cinemas and not properly done so it becomes a standard teen flick. My advice, rent or watch this movie on TV and if you enjoy it slightly, go purchase the DVD to broaden and expand you're enjoyment of this film. Enjoy!",
         "A sci-fi/horror flick aimed at the \"Scream\" crowd, \"Disturbing Behavior\" concerns at idyllic coastal town where everything seems just a bit too peachy. The local high school is populated by picture perfect teens who, despite their wholesome love of yogurt, tend to get a little trigger happy when the hormones start flying. When the new kid in town (Jason Marsden) stumbles upon a dark secret, it's up to him and a few other mistfits (Nick Stahl, Katie Holmes) to shut down the powers that be. There's loads of potential in this film that is, unfortunately, never capitalized upon. You can thank the editing department for that one. If the deleted scenes are any evidence, this movie was trimmed and dumbed down to the point of no recognition. While the uninterrupted flow makes for an easy, breezy viewing, the overall story lacks substance and coherence. Its 84 minute running time, in turn, is a redeeming feature. The director, David Nutter, spends much of the film building up ample amounts of atmosphere and is aided wonderfully by a brilliant score by fellow \"X-Files\" alumnus Mark Snow as well as some striking scenery thanks to it's Vancouver location. So, the film isn't a complete waste. You'll get some kicks out of the dialog and while Katie Holmes in particular isn't given much to do, she at least looks good in skimpy outfits while doing so. Also, it's hard to hate on a movie that is of a more intelligent cut than the other teen-geared fare being produced in its time. The movie at least aims high, and even when it doesn't quite reach, it never bores. A passable sci-fi teen romp, \"Disturbing Behavior\" is entertaining late-night fodder that, surprisingly, will inspire repeat viewings. It's a shame, though, to think of how much better the whole could have been."

         "After the suicide of the teenager Allen Clark, his family decides to move from Chicago to the quiet Cradle Bay Island seeking a peaceful life for the siblings Steve and Lindsay Clark. When Steve joins the local high-school, the outcast Gavin Strick befriends Steve and introduces his also rejected friend Rachel Wagner to the newcomer. Gavin exposes to Steve in the refectory the punks, the nerds and the different tribes of the school and he defends the weird theory that a sinister force changes the behavior of the annoyingly perfect \"Blue Ribbons\", a group of good students that wear identical jackets and gather in the Yogurt Shoppe. Further he tells that he had witnessed the blue ribbon Andy Efkin killing their schoolmate Mary Jo that is missing and the local Officer Cox covering the murder. Steve does not believe on Gavin words, but when his friend is submitted to the treatment of Dr. Edgar Caldicott and immediately changes his behavior, joining the Blue Ribbons, Steve and Rachel decides to investigate the mystery discovering the dark secret of the perfect behavior.",
         "A man moves to a new town and gets harassed by these annoyingly perfect \"good kids\". He makes friends with the local rejects, one of which is a conspiracy theorist, another who is an albino, and a third who soon becomes a romantic interest. Together they discover that the jocks are actually lobotomized zombies and that they're next in line.",
         "When Steve Clark moves with his family to Cradle Bay and enrolls in the local high school, he's not sure where he fits in with the local high school crowds. He doesn't really fit in with the punkers, the nerds, the hot-rodders, or any of the other diverse groups you would expect to find in a typical American high school. Actually, Steve looks more like one of the jocks, but they don't seem quite right either. In fact, the jock crowd seems perfect with their matching varsity jackets, perfect hair cuts, politically-correct charity work, and all-around perfect behavior that would make any mom and pop proud. When Steve befriends two of the less desirable social misfits at school, Gavin Strick and Rachel Wagner, he soon discovers why the jocks' perfect behavior is so disturbing.",
