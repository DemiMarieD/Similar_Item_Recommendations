         "To say that this movie is shallow, or unrealistic, is to miss the point. While it certainly has a lot to say about sex, and especially sexual fidelity, the point of the film is not that at all, but that concerns of sex are not truly the most important factors in a relationship. While loyalty and honesty certainly are, forgiveness is still a virtue, and lying about sex is not the same as lying about feelings. Though I, of course, do not agree with what the female characters in this movie did, at least the movie makes the oft-overlooked point that sex isn't everything, a point seldom made in movies, and often made in life. Though it is certainly not an exceptional movie, it is worth seeing, and an interesting look into the privileged status sex has attained in our modern society.",
         "I liked this, but I felt that it moved a bit slow, and there were a few scenes that could have been cut/shortened. I was impressed by Heather Graham, but Natasha Gregson Wagner left me sort of empty. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent film that I'd surely recommend, but in the same token it seems like something's missing. Like there's a better movie trying to get out, but it's trapped by monologues and general dialogue that run way too long.",
         "I watched it last night and thought it was brilliant. Robert Downey is just stunning, and the final scene of the movie floored me. I''m not sure how to use the word pathos properly but that final scene exudes it. But before that the whole movie is an excellent examination of an actor who can't stop acting and the two girlfriends and mother he loves. Very witty and exciting to watch. I loved it.",
         "Toback's backbone of a script is great- it sets up the finest young actor of my generation (debatable- but worth saying) Downey Jr. is masterful in adlibbing and improvising. He accomplishes what Brando failed to do in Last Tango in Paris. Downey is real. His problems, his inner angst, his troubles all surface. This is like being with him. His magic and charm are entrancing and enchanting. Pretty cool. Worth a watch late at night- intense though.",
         "Convict/thespian Robert Downey, Jr. tops his frenzied role in \"Natural Born Killers\" with another manic Tasmanian Devil-style performance. It's the funniest of the year, an actor's nightmare (how far do you go when you can do whatever you want?), but also the quintessential Downey, Jr. persona. Heather Graham is my baby, she just doesn't know it yet. Just kidding--truth be told, she excels in the part of one of Downey Jr.'s girlfriends. Wagner nearly matches her in the role of the other. Toback's direction is stagey (what else can you do with one set?), but his writing is on fire. Sometimes, you snag bits of the actor's riffs and laugh at what you can get your hands on. At other times, you sit back and let it flow over you--this is high-speed Jack Kerouac, coupled with Whit Stillman's keen ear for American bourgeois speech patterns. Wagner and Graham test each other on Downey Jr.'s lovemaking speeches, tying a noose for him before he even arrives, later Downey Jr. verbally abuses and repairs himself in his bathroom mirror--highlights of a dynamite script. 1998 was the year for actors and actresses, and many notables (and a few unknowns) did landmark work: Jim Carrey in \"The Truman Show\", Jane Horrocks in \"Little Voice\", Warren Beatty in \"Bulworth\", John Travolta and Kathy Bates in \"Primary Colors\", Roberto Benigni in \"Life is Beautiful\", Bill Pullman in \"Zero Effect\", and Robert Downey Jr. in this one. James Toback, who also penned the wretched (and similarly themed) \"The Pick-Up Artist\" in '87, is back on track. With \"Bugsy\", \"The Gambler\" and this film on his record, I eagerly anticipate his next picture.",
         "i admit my love for this film is twofold--the setting (my City, Soho loft vibe!) and of course Robert himself. he is sexy, period. he is talented beyond what the public at large has realized. this was shown in his fabulous singing in this film. who knew he could sing? and don't start me on his acting--he is fantastic. this script is brilliant, tantalizing, intelligent, refreshing yet also so real that it's kinda eerie, but in a good way. so he's caught playing boytoy to 2 different girls. the girls could hit him, be stupid, and ruin the film but instead it gets heady, dare i say cerebral? and unlike most stuff out now that feels it must include a \"dyke\" subplot to be \"hip\", it doesn't \"go there\" but rather focuses on the dysfunction of this man and the 2 lovers he's been simultaneously f-ing. the staging is perfectly set--a tight, confining setting of a loft. perfect. and the lighting is great, a light you'll only find in Soho. just amazing. all the actors give perfect performances. every nuance is right, every word is felt, believed. it's simply divine.",
         "I think all the performances were very good, although Downey's overshadows his two fellow actors. As I watched, I laughed a lot. When it ended my first impression was that it is a very clever lightweight comedy. Since then, the film has made me think fairly deeply, a rare effect indeed from any film. To date it poses two questions to me: 1-can a man/woman love two people at once (or is s/he a simple philanderer)? 2-is fidelity possible or desirable in the milieu of this film? A last question is whether self-destructiveness is inseparable from the talent of actors like Downey and Robin Williams and others? I have revised my first assessment of the film upward.",
         "When I first saw Two Girls and A Guy, I thought to myself that something was wrong. The storyline impressed me, but the feeling that I got was that it would flow much better in the theater. The script through the whole movie seemed much more like a play, and not a film at all. After I noticed this, I began to watch the movie as if it were on stage, and it made it so much more meaningful, and the acting performances much stronger. If Robert Downey Jr. performed this role on stage, the audience would walk away with something really special. He is what makes the viewer forget that they are watching a film. He is outstanding in this role.",
         "This movie, may have been the best to focus on the many talents of Robert Downey Jr. I'm not sure if the movie was a full script for this movie, or if a lot of it was ad lib. It all seemed so very natural. About 90% of the movie takes place in the living room of RDJ's, character's NY loft. I was never aware of RDJ's talent for singing, piano, and theatrical performances. There are a couple of graphic moments, but all in all, it's a GREAT movie. Anyone who loves RDj, should most definately give this one a chance. Even though I hate Heather Graham, with a passion, I am able to watch this movie, over and over.",
         "Its quite funny that many people who i've spoken to after watching 2gg, really seem to have missed the entire point of the film. For me, the production is summed up by the line \"maybe we aren't designed for monogamy\" uttered by a flawless Heather Graham. In what has been an almost institutionalised habit, the film industry has focused primarily on the joys and wonders of dual relationships without even giving airspace to alternative lifestyles that are far more rational and far more realistic. The film itself is a classic hitchcock-style piece, set more or less in one day in one apartment. Two girls (graham and wagner) discover whilst waiting for there boyfriends to return home, that they actually have the same boyfriend. Deciding to confront him, but unsure how, they break into his loft and from there the hijinx begin. Truly a modern classic, and have i mentioned how good Robert Downey Jr is yet?? Boy he is good."
