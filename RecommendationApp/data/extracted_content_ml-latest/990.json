         "This is Jean Claude Van Dammes coming of age film, where he proves he is actually an actor as well as a martial artist. His character and portrayal of the character were very convincing, none of the stupid smiling and gurning of previous roles he's played. Ignore the twins storyline aspect of the film, this is not a retread of Double Impact, and the films could not be more different. Problem for JCVD is that his many martial arts fans might find this film a bit too intelligent, and the usual cinema goer simply won't see it because its got JCVD in it, which is a shame really, as its not a bad film at all. There are no real downers, the villains are suitably villainous, the direction is good, JCVD is good, the story is OK, and just as importantly, JCVD's acting is good. I caught this film again for the first time in an age, and I have to say, I liked it.",
         "If you see only one Van Damme film...see Maximum Risk. It is a decent thriller, not just a martial arts flick. Unfortunately, after seeing how good Van Damme can be (yes, he can act - something we've yet to see from Stephen Seagal who he's usually compared to) it makes you sad to see how many bad films he's really made.",
         "\"Maximum Risk\" is not just a good Van Damme movie, but it's also probably one of the better action movies in the last few years. The story is well written (for an action movie), and is fast paced. Director Ringo Lam (\"City on Fire\") impresses the viewer with excellent action sequences. This is definitely Van Damme's best turn as an actor. Natasha Henstridge does a rather decent turn as the damsel in distress, and creates good chemistry between herself and Van Damme. I don't see why this was a huge flop in theaters; it's surely Van Damme's best and at heart an exciting action flick.",
         "This Jean-Claude Van Damme action vehicle gets good marks for sound, low profanity, some very good action scenes and some interesting characters that keep your attention. It loses marks for excessive violence, too much \"Rambo\" mentality (good guys don't get hit despite a barrage of bullets) and, yet, another modern-day film in which the FBI is corrupt. This is also another of these action films that has TOO much action. It would be better with some more lulls. It almost gets ridiculous in spots. Nevertheless, some of the scenes such as car chases, fires and explosions are so well-done you have to admire the great stunt work in here. Man, those stunt men earn their money! You would be hard-pressed to find two leads in any film with the bodies of Van Damme and Natasha Henstridge and neither are shy about showing them off, so you have the usual gratuitous sex scenes, but they are brief, as is the profanity. This is a loud film. If you have good speakers, be ready to have the room shake with lots of bass. Overall, it's about 100 minutes of mindless but entertaining diversion.",
         "This has to be the best Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie he has made. It has it all, and it has it in spades. This movie is 100 minutes, and 95 of those are pure action. You have great car chases through the streets of Nice and New York. You have a whole lot of people the Government is not going to have to arrest and try because they will not be around. You have three, count them three outstanding fights between Jean-Claude Van Damme and the biggest, baddest dude you can imagine. And, you have Natasha Henstridge in the bathroom making love and giving us a view we will long remember. What more can you ask for?",
         "French Cop,Alain(Jean Claude Van-Damme)one day finds out he had a twin Brother,travels to America to find answers about who he was,and who murdered him.Running afoul of the Russian Mob,a Brian Bosworth Looking Hit-man,and crooked FBI agents along the way in New York.He also finds himself Protecting/falling in love with the dead bro's squeeze played by Natasha Henstridge.All leading up to a big shoot out in an abandoned Wherehouse...Sorta.This is not your usual Van Damme movie. Matured Van Damme?Yep. For starters Maximum risk is helmed by Asian-action-man,Ringo Lam.He gives the movie a lot of atmosphere and style.The fight scenes are realistic,gritty,and for the most part brutal.Notice Van Damme goes for the Jugular here.Breaking bones as well as high flying kicks. The gunfights are staged well.Some good chases.And a nice scene involving a chainsaw. The scenery is worth it too.We start out in warm,beautiful,summertime France to Dead of winter, smelly, New York city.I think its a nice contrast arc on the story. Lam gets one of the very best acting gigs outta Van Damme Yet.He is at his darkest and most volatile here.Natasha Henstridge is kinda wasted to anything but eye candy.Zach Grenier and Paul Ben Victor are just okay as the bad guys calling the shots.Trouble is they are not really a physical threat for Van Damme.Stefanos Miltsakais as Redface fits this bill very well.His 3 confrontations with Alain are worthwhile.although its get to be a little tedious bordering on parody. This would probably be the best Van Damme movie if it were not for the slow pace and excessive dialog,which does serve a purpose.Its just we get some flashy action.Then 15 minutes go by leaving us wanting more.Then it starts up again.Brake.Gas.Brake.Gas. The gunfights are good,but It seems Ringo was holding back a little from his usual trademark stuff to pacify the suits behind the scenes. If your looking for the usual from JC,then go watch the Quest.This is a much more complex,adult-themed movie.",
         "This movie stars Van Damme who has been in many B-movies and is known as a b-movie action star.I believe thats why this movie gets this low rating. This movie is an a-movie and one of the best action movies and one of my favorites.The rating is simply ridiculous.Van Damme may not be a first rate actor but can he hold his own in this kind of material.Everything else in this movie is first rate.The plot is interesting,there are all kinds of chases and action scenes,All the action scenes are terrific and there's plenty of them.The bad guy is one impressive dude,makes for some really awesome wrestling scenes with Van Damme. The girl is the gorgeous Natasha Henstridge.In my book this is one fine action movie.",
         "As a Van Damme fan when i saw this film i was instantly blown away.The only thing i didn't like was the brother storyline again.How many brothers has this guy got.But seriously this is an action movie from start to finish.There is car chases, fights, and of course a beautiful woman.What more could you ask for?.Well nothing really,this movie has it all and to think it was from the start of Van Damme's drug taking days.He must have been on drugs to make Double Team which is'nt bad film ,just bad actors (Dennis Rodman).Any way Maximum Risk is a movie that will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.The fight scenes are great and well directed.And it has Natasha Henstridge who acts well and puts on a decent performance.She is also easy on the eye in more ways than one.",
         "Maximum Risk is the second Van Damme-movie to be directed by a HongKong-director(the first was \"Hard Target\" by John Woo), Ringo Lam delivers stylish action as always, but this isn`t the same as \"Full Contact\", but this is very good after American standards. Van Damme delivers his usual stuff. Maximum Risk is great! 9/10",
         "This Van Damme vehicle is plotty, yet the plot is mostly uninteresting, and ultimately cliched. The car chases are spectacular but repetitive, and that repetition quickly grows tiresome. Fight sequences are mostly impressive, but when Van Damme faced the same (great) opponent for the THIRD time, the thing started resembling a parody. Best reason to see the film is, as the first reviewer points out, the presence of the smashingly beautiful and athletic Henstridge. Van Damme's performance is OK, as always."

         "Alain Moreau is a cop in Nice, France. Alain is at a funeral that is being held for a fellow cop, and Alain's partner Sebastien shows up. Sebastien takes Alain to a murder scene, where the victim is a man who looks exactly like Alain. There is evidence that the victim was being chased and that the victim was recently tortured. Sebastien and Alain go to the Hotel Chevre D'Or, where they find the victim's ID, which shows that his name was Mikhail Suverov, and Mikhail was born on the exact same day Alain was born on. Mikhail was on his way to the street where Alain's home is located. Mikhail had come to Nice from New York City. Alain visits his mother Chantal, and tells Chantal about this case. Chantal confesses that Mikhail was Alain's twin brother, and Chantal had given Mikhail up for adoption. Mikhail had been on his way to introduce himself to Alain when Mikhail was murdered. On the next morning, Alain and Sebastien go to Paris, so Alain can talk to Etienne St. Denis, the lawyer who handled Mikhail's adoption. Sebastien and Alain head to a building where Etienne's office is on the 6th floor. When Alain and Sebastien get to the 6th floor, they notice smoke pouring out from under Etienne's office door. They open the door - only to see flames everywhere, and an explosion knocks them backwards. Sebastien takes off after a blond haired, red-faced man that he and Alain saw leaving the area. Alain finds Etienne dead and rescues Etienne's secretary, who gives Mikhail's adoption papers to Alain. Outside of the building, Alain and Sebastien read the adoption papers. According to the adoption papers, Mikhail's adoptive father was a Soviet diplomat who lived in Paris for 5 years before moving to the USA in 1968. Alain takes a flight to New York City, where he hails a taxicab that is driven by Davis Hartley, who drops Alain off at his downtown destination, and runs an errand for Alain. Alain talks to Morris, a man who knew Mikhail. Morris explains that Mikhail's adoptive family had a grocery store in Little Odessa, a section of Brooklyn that is controlled by the Russian mafia, and that when Mikhail was 16 years old, he had joined the Russian mafia. Morris tells Alain that there is a nightclub in Little Odessa called The Bohemia. Alain has Davis drive him to the Bohemia, where everyone thinks he's Mikhail. Alain goes inside, and a woman takes Alain to where the payphones are and kisses him. This woman is Mikhail's fiancé, Alex Bartlett, and she thinks Alain is Mikhail. Alex tells Alain to leave, and that she'll see him later. Alain goes outside and is confronted by a group of Russian men led by a thug named Yuri. They tell Alain, whom they think is Mikhail, that Ivan Dzasokhov, one of the higher-ups in the Russian mafia, wants to talk to Mikhail. Alain beats up Yuri and his men, and is picked up by Davis. Davis drops Alain off at a hotel. Alex goes to the hotel and up to Alain's room. Alain tells Alex that he's not Mikhail, and that Mikhail was murdered. Ivan and two of his men show up. Alain and Alex escape, and Dvis picks them up. Davis drives for a couple of more blocks, and then realizes that he's been shot. Davis stops the cab, and Alain gets out of the cab to check on Davis, who dies in Alain's arms. Alex tells Alain that Mikhail once told her that he had a plan that would get him out of the Russian mafia. Alex tells Alain that Ivan won't stop until they are both dead, and that Ivan and his boss, Dmitri Kirov, who has FBI agents Pellman and Loomis in his pocket, are relentless. But, as it turns out, not nearly as relentless as Alain when it comes to avenging Mikhail's murder.",
         "Alain Moreau didn't know he had a brother, even a twin brother - until he found him laying dead on the street. To reveal the truth about his twin, he now has to continue in his footsteps - he simply has to become Mikhail, travel across the Atlantic and sink into the world that ended his brothers days. Here he meets his brothers beautiful girlfriend Alex, who doesn't suspect a thing for starters. She works as a waitress in a pub, owned by the Russian mafia, and when they find out Alain's true intentions, all hell breaks out...",
