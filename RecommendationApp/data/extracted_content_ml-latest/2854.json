      "synopsis": "Dr. Stephens ( Michael Harvey) presides over a small hospital for the insane; the asylum is a large three-story white house located in an isolated, rural setting. With only himself and a small staff to care for the patients, his approach to psychiatric care is considered very liberal. He allows the patients access to their individual manias, believing that by encouraging them to act out their inner conflicts, they can resolve them. As the film opens, he is working with a patient named Oliver Cameron ( Gene Ross), a former judge who is obsessively striking a wooden log with an ax. Nurse Jane St. Claire ( Jessie Lee Fulton) is inside the sanitorium packing her suitcase, as if to leave. She has a confrontation with a patient named Harriet ( Camilla Carr), a young woman who carries a baby doll and believes it to be real. Harriet accuses Jane of wanting to steal her baby, and threatens to kill her if she does. Jane rushes outside to tell Dr. Stephens that she has decided to leave the sanitarium for good; she can no longer tolerate the madness that runs rampant there. As she is talking to Stephens, the Judge suddenly turns and strikes Stephens with his ax, felling him. Jane shrieks, but suddenly another woman rushes towards them; she is Dr. Geraldine Masters ( Annabelle Weenick), and she tells Jane to go inside, she will take care of everything. Inside the hospital, Jane rushes to get her suitcase and leave, but Harriet appears. Her \"baby\" is in Jane's room, planted there by some unseen person. Furious, Harriet attacks Jane and kills her, strangling her and then slamming her head inside the suitcase. That evening, a new nurse comes to the asylum; young, pretty Charlotte Beale ( Rosie Holotik). Dr. Masters seems hostile to her presence, claiming she was unaware that Dr. Stephens had hired her, and she tells her that Dr. Stephens has been killed by the Judge. After a brief conversation where Charlotte tells Dr. Masters that Dr. Stephens hired her a week ago by contacting her via a letter and that Charlotte quit an important job at an urban psych hospital to take the job at Stephens Sanitarium. Masters agrees to let her stay for the time being and shows her to her quarters for the night. The next morning, Dr. Masters introducing Charlotte to the rest of the patients at the small hospital in the recreation room; Danny ( Jessie Kirby) is a bizarre young man who plays pranks and giggles maniacally; Sergeant Jaffe ( Hugh Feagin) is shell-shocked Vietnam vet constantly on the lookout for the 'enemy'; Sam ( Bill McGhee) is a large black man with the mind of an eight-year-old child after a botched lobotomy four years ago (that Masters claims she was a part of); Allyson King ( Betty Chandler) is a nymphomaniac constantly in search of physical and emotional affection; Jennifer Downey ( Harryette Warren) seems mostly catatonic until she randomly explodes with sudden violence. In addition to Judge Cameron whom went crazy due to the stress of his former job, as well as Harriet whose baby recently died and she keeps a baby doll to keep the memory of her baby alive, the final patient is a senile old woman named Mrs. Callingham ( Rhea MacAdams). When Mrs. Callingham is alone with Charlotte, she tells her that she is in danger and that she must \"get out\". Sam takes an immediate liking to Charlotte, but he talks about Dr. Stephens in the present tense. Masters tells Charlotte that Sam just has no concept of death, so Charlotte ignores Sam's remarks about his discussions with Dr. Stephens. Strange things continue to happen, however. Charlotte soon discovers that the phone lines to the house is down, and Masters seems unconcerned about having it reconnected. That evening, Jennifer attacks Charlotte with a knife, which Masters also tries to brush over. Mrs. Callingham again tries to warn Charlotte about something, but she awakens the next morning with her tongue cut out; Masters tells Charlotte that the old woman did it to herself in a fit. Later that day, someone steals one of the patient files from the office and Masters finds it in Sarge's room; as punishment, she sets the paper on fire and places it in his outstretched palm, burning his hand as punishment. The paper has Masters' names on it. Suddenly an interloper arrives. Ray ( Robert Dracup), a telephone repair man, has come to the house to find out why the service isn't operating. Masters tries to send him away, but when he says that he'll have to come back with more help, she relents and lets him examine the phone box, which is inside a closet. While he is in there, Allyson approaches him and comes onto him suddenly, in a bizarre fashion. The next day, Charlotte takes Danny for a walk around the grounds of the asylum where he tries to make a move on her, but she rebuffs his advances. That evening, Danny attacks Charlotte while she sleeps with a knife, but the Judge stops him and tells him that he needs to restrain himself. When Charlotte discovers several viles of medicine missing from the medicine cabinet, she tells Dr. Masters about the theft. Masters searches Jennifer's room and finds the viles of contraband medicine and places them back in the medicine cabinet and locks it up. When Jennifer sees her room ramsacked and the medicine missing, she goes to Masters' office to try to break into the medicine cabinet to get more, but someone kills her by stabing her in her left eye with a letter opener knife. A little later, Sam is cleaning up the kitchen area after dinner when he opens a closet door and discovers something. Sam goes to get Allyson and tells her he has to show her something. Allyson follows him and Sam takes her to find the body of Ray, horribly slashed to death. Allyson becomes hysterical, wailing about how he loved her. Charlotte finds Allyson sobbing in her room where she tells her that Ray was going to take her away from the hospital, but Masters wouldn't allow it; she killed him to keep order in the asylum. Charlotte denies this but Allyson tells her what she has failed to realize (and what we suspected) all along: Masters is simply another patient in the asylum. Allyson tells her that Masters was a former physician who made a fatal error during a procedure and went insane when her dream of becoming a doctor was denied. Dr. Stephens had been allowing her to pretend to be his colleague as part of her therapy. Charlotte is horrified to discover that she is the only sane person in the secluded hospital. The inmates all confirm this with Charlotte, and the Judge suggests that Charlotte herself is insane, acting out her fantasy of becoming a nurse (because Masters told all of them that Charlotte herself is a patient). Charlotte finds that she cannot escape the house; all the doors and windows have been bolted shut. In desperation she enters the dim basement, only to encounter a shadowy figure who grasps at her ankles. In terror, she bludgeons it to death with a toy boat, only to realize that the figure was Dr. Stephens, wounded but still alive in the basement whom has been confided there by Sam and kept alive. Charlotte also finds the body of Jennifer. \"Doctor\" Masters confronts Charlotte and makes an attempt on her life. She has Sam (upset over Charlotte killing Dr. Stephens) take Charlotte upstairs to a vacant room where she plots to have Sam kill her. However, Sam has an change-of-heart and restrains Masters from harming Charlotte. Just then, the other inmates (Judge Cameron, Danny, Sarge Jaffe, Allyson, and Harriett) appear and attack Masters, revolting against her desire to keep them all under her command and of her inhuman treatment of them since Dr. Stephens death. Sam helps Charlotte escape through the basement and out the cellar door. While Charlotte flees down the road on foot in the pouring rain, Sam returns to find Masters dead; gorily hacked apart at the hands of the other inmates. In retaliation, he kills each of the inmates with an axe. In the final shot, Sam sits alone in the office, the only survivor of the ordeal, eating a popsicle while covered in the blood of the dead inmates.",

         "I was surprised how good this film was. The IMDB rating is so low. I'm not sure why it rates so poorly. The biggest problem with the flick is that it had a miniscule budget. The overall look is fairly shabby - a very thin production. BUT it has everything else you want in a cheapo horror flick...the script is original, the acting is actually decent, bordering on pretty good for a few characters. The camera work is creative. The heroine is a babe. A bit of gore and a bit of suspense. Seasoned horror junkies may be able to guess the main gimmick after the first couple of scenes, but it is still worth watching. The film does provide a couple of minor twists that you won't guess though. If you are looking for bland and well produced then perhaps you should stick with Phantom Menace. If you want to watch a nifty little throwaway horror flick, try Dont Look In The Basement.",
         "If you love drive-in cheeze from the early '70s you will just love this one.How could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum? You can't! Crazy folks and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination. The film looks like it was shot inside someone's house for about $320.65. For me that just ads to the fun of watching this type of stuff.The gore is a bit mild compared to others of this ilk,but there is enough to keep us bloodthirsty sickos (like myself)happy.Some horror films drag in parts and leave you waiting for something to happen.That's not the case here.The characters are entertaining enough to make every frame quite enjoyable.There is never a dull moment from start to finish.The mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable. I liked it so much that right after the end credits I watched it a second time.It's an absolute must see for any self respecting drive-in horror nut. 9.5/10 on the Drive-in-Freak-O-Meter...required viewing Yea I love you..I DO love you...now take your Thorazine and put your clothes back on...please....8)",
         "Some can call it cheap, others can call it stupid and some may even call it pointless, but these are all adjectives once attributed to classics such as Night of the Living Dead, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Last House on the Left. As the latter was also distributed by Hallmark, they obliged to reproduced the same tag line here - `To avoid fainting keep repeating: \u0091It's only a movie\u0085only a movie\u0085only a movie'.' Don't Look in the Basement tells the story of Charlotte Beale (heartstoppingly gorgeous Rosie Holotik and Playboy covergirl, April, 1972), a young nurse whose arrival at her new position coincides with a dramatic change within the Stephen's Sanatarium for the mentally insane. The unusual treatment here involves allowing patients to roam free around the hospital, allowing them to express their repressed inhibitions to cure their madness. The patients are a truly frightening gathering. One girl shuffles around with a doll she believes is her baby and if you offend her you'll die; A chap believes himself to be a judge, constantly preaching courtroom jargon; A nymphomaniac wanting love from anyone who lunges at all men; An ex-Vietnam vet watches over the premises, assuring nobody escapes\u0085etc. Soon, poor Charlotte realizes that all is not as it should be and '...a sense of unease creeps over her...' Will she solve the mystery of the Sanitarium before she too is driven insane? If you allow yourself to get with the flow of this low budget horror film, then you might even see the twist in the tail. I won't spoil it for you here\u0085",
         "S.F. Brownrigg is surely one of the most overlooked directors in the slasher genre with Basement being his masterwork. The plot concerns a young nurse (Playboy covergirl Rosie Holotik) who takes a job at a secluded mental hospital. Upon her arrival, it transpires that her employer has been killed by one of the patients and the place is now being run by strict disciplinarian, Dr Masters. Make no mistake, this is a horribly under-staffed operation. The lunatics truly are taking over the asylum and you really have to feel for the young nurse. Tough first gig. The basement figures only very briefly and towards the end of film. It is, in fact, the safest place in the house because the rest of the place is pure madness. I can only assume that Don't Look in the Basement was perhaps an afterthought as a title, possibly forced on the film by the backers to make it sound more scary as the title card appears to have been dropped in arbitrarily and does not match the other titles. Scenes worth watching for are the Judge attacking the doctor with an axe and a broken rubber knife in the final bloodbath. Forget One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. This is the stuff.",
         "Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there. She is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor. Is Dr. Masters all she seems to be? DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me. The acting is excellent, my favorite performance being by Betty Chandler as Allyson the nymphomaniac. The chills just jump right off the screen. You probably won't have to say \"It's only a movie, it's only a movie\", it isn't that scary, but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre, which I do. It is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed. AXE is another cheap film that is looked down upon. Maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn't have excellent effects and/or isn't considered a classic doesn't have a chance with an audience. But I think that after people see this movie, they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish.",
         "Take an ensemble cast of good B grade actors, give them a good script, a somewhat original premise, and unobtrusive directing, and you may end up with a film that over-achieves as much as \"Don't Look in the Basement\" did. The film takes place in a large house which is home to several psychotic individuals. Before the plot even begins, the head of the hospital is chopped up by one of the patients with an axe. Then Rosie Holotik enters the hospital looking for the axe victim and finds that the hospital has a new head who is not at first willing to honor her agreement with the deceased Dr. Stephens. Soon, however, Dr. Masters reconsiders and Nurse Beale (Holotik) is hired. The rest of the film builds tension and successfully develops the individual psychoses of the in-mates. After a while it becomes very unclear who is a patient and who is a doctor. In the end, Don't Look in the Basement is a cleverly plotted film which benefits from generally good acting and directing and not-overly-ambitious camera work. A must-see for B horror fans, and an interesting diversion for those interested in psycho-dramas and psychological thrillers. Be warned, however, this film is slightly more gory and sexy than the average horror film of its time.",
         "You'll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land. It's not so much of a horror show, but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients. \"Scream\" is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors. Notice the \"judge\", who's about to put on the ax from behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r!!! Not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness, but when you get a chance, remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady: \"Get out! Get out! And never ever come back!\". Don't you wish you haven't looked in the basement?",
         "Like the review before me, people were a little too critical on this film. Delivered very well with a great cast. My friend and I watched it a few days ago and he guessed the plot early in the film, and said \"It would be awesome if this happened\" Which it did, so it was really cool- It has a good story and twists and keeps you guessing. Sometimes it's a bit humorous, but the setting and mood was delivered well. This is a good film to watch with some buddies or a special someone. It will keep you interested until the very end, and will give you that good IL' Horror feeling. If you're looking for a pretty gory, weird movie- Don't look in the Basement is definitely it.",
         "This film kicks off as I thought it would go on, in that a mental patient slays his doctor with the business end of an axe. However, considering that was included on the Video Nasty list in the 80's, it isn't very gory. I fully understand and agree with the idea that buckets of gore does not make a movie great, but when I'm watching a shocking, previously banned Video Nasty; call me old fashioned, but I generally expect to see gore. Still, the film does have other redeeming features. The acting isn't one of them however; when watching a film like this, one doesn't go in expecting to see great performances, but some of the acting in this movie was so unbelievably below standard that at times even I, a fan of shock horror with bad performances, cringed. The old woman that later has her tongue removed is a particular cause for concern on this film's acting resume; I know that the roles of the mental patients are meant to be fairly quirky, but this one was downright insulting. The rest of the bad performances come from unknown actors, most of which would never go on to make another film, or at least another film of note; and that is quite fitting really. Another feature of the film that isn't redeeming is the way it is filmed. If I said that it was unprofessional, I'd be right; and I am right, the movie is unprofessionally filmed. Because of this, the whole piece stinks of amateurs at the bottom of their craft. I know that you cant expect fabulous cinematography from a film such as this, but the fact that it is bad makes sure that the film faces an uphill struggle from the start; it looks bad, and for some that will mean it is bad. However, despite all said so far; this film really does have some redeeming qualities. The characters for one; they're not particularly well done; they certainly aren't deep or fleshed out, but they do make sure that the film creates the right atmosphere for a sanatorium; they're a mixed bag, and although I've never been in a nut house, the one in this film is what I'd expect one to be like. Also of note is the way that it's fairly well plotted; there's always something going on to keep you entertained and it doesn't tie itself up with lots of meaningless plot details, which is definitely to it's credit. The twist towards the end should have been seen coming a mile off by me, but it wasn't, and I think that is to the film's credit also; it catches you by surprise. By the end, it becomes obvious as to exactly what is in the basement, but by then it doesn't matter because the film is nearly over anyway. Overall, Don't Look in the Basement is one of the better Video Nasty's that I've seen, and I've seen a few from that illustrious list. What it lacks in certain areas, it makes up for in others and although it's not very gory, certainly not by today's standards; I'd still recommend this to fans of shock horror cinema.",
         "There's not much I can add to the positive reviews of the film, other than I agree completely - this weird little movie has a unique atmosphere all its own. Brownrigg creates a very effective atmosphere of obsessive madness; the movie breathes down your neck! It's amazing that a film so well-lit and full of bright colors can be so unsettling. As someone mentioned, the film looks like a retitle because there's a strange title card inserted, but I have seen a televised version of the film that had the original titles superimposed on-screen - they were orange and read \"Don't Look In The Basement\" - with quote marks around them, just like that. Why they were taken out and replaced by that garish title card is a mystery to me, but the originals did exist. Another interesting note: I read in an old horror magazine that during the climactic massacre, Brownrigg wanted to make things ultra-gory and so he used a lot of slaughterhouse entrails (sheep, I think), and they were kept in a bag with fake blood. Well, when it came time to film that scene, it was hot in the room, and the entrails had begun to rot, so when the actors tore the bag open, they all nearly vomited at the stench! If you look really closely around the edges of the frame, you can get little glimpses of some entrail... but, to my knowledge, they aren't graphically shown in any prints. In any case, check this movie out... it proves that a low budget can be made up for with a lot of imagination. There's no other film like this... I also recommend Brownrigg's other movies."

Now, Dr. Masters is running the asylum alone with her brand-new nurse, who does her best to befriend the eclectic group of patients: the shell-shocked ex-sergeant; the lobotomized Popsicle-sucking child-man; the puritanical former judge; the doom-dealing old woman; the would-be mother to a baby doll; the giggling, clown-haired prankster; the needy nymphomaniac; and the mainly catatonic young woman who occasionally indulges in knife attacks. The pretty young nurse was eager to work with the forward-thinking Dr. Stephens, but finds his successor to be less than welcoming and the hospital to be less than wholesome.",
         "A young psychiatric nurse goes to work at a lonesome asylum following a murder. There, she experiences varying degrees of torment from the patients."
