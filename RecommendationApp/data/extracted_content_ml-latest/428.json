This is an excellent small-scale movie with a good story and well-developed characters, some excellent performances, along with subtle directorial flair. In a lot of ways, this resembles a softer, gentler Goodfellas. The story revolves around Calogero Anello, (Lillo Brancato), a seventeen year old Italian growing up in a 1960s Bronx neighborhood. Calogero is befriended by the local mob boss (Palminteri) over the objections of his father (De Niro). And this movie tells the story of his coming of age in this environment. Francis Capra does a fine job as the nine year-old Calogero, and Palminteri and De Niro show excellence at their craft. Brancato does a respectable job, but suffers from comparison. This is a personal favorite of mine and I recommend it whole-heartedly. There are some wonderful scenes, strong dialogue and enough action to balance out the story and make this enjoyable by all kinds of viewers.",

         "This might be a matter of taste, but \"A Bronx Tale\" remains Number 2 on list of Favorite Movies of All Time. It just happens to be one of the most deeply moving, powerful films I've ever encountered. Yes, some may consider this a simple story, but that's the beauty of it. It's a down-to-earth, coming-of-age story that perfectly mirrors the life of a boy like C growing up in the Bronx at such a hectic time. Of course, this is based on Chazz Palminteri's real life experiences, and I envy Chazz, being an aspiring screenwriter/director. I wish I had life experiences like that to put on film. And I have to commend my man Bobby D for bringing these images to life in such a vibrant, engrossing way. DeNiro captures every element of the 1960's Bronx, with a great opening sequence featuring doo-wop singers sweetly singing the movie's theme. He captures so many elements of the period, and it was nice to see only one goof was captured. It was interesting to find out that most of the movie was actually shot in Brooklyn--my hometown. Then again, the two places are alike in their own simple ways. Bobby D has a short, but memorable role (which is against type) as a working-class bus driver. He's desperately trying to get by and support his son, Cologero (I think that's how to spell it...LOL), and disapproves of his son's new \"job\" with gangster Sonny (Chazz, who gives a landmark performance). The interactions between DeNiro and his son are extraordinary in the way they mirror the way a real father and son would argue in those situations. As I said, it's the whole down-to-earth quality of this movie that I think made it tick. It's nothing pretentious. This is a simple movie about humanity. The gangster plot is merely a backdrop. The only other movie I've seen him in was \"Crimson Tide\" in a very small role, but Lillo Brancato (who plays DeNiro's son in the later years) is a revalation! He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen and I'm surprised I haven't seen him in any more recent movies. And I have to say DeNiro did a dynamic job of casting. As far as I know, Brancato and Bobby aren't related, but please tell me if I'm wrong, because they look EXACTLY alike! If you've seen any of DeNiro's very early films, Brancato is a mirror image of him. Is it coincidence or what? I've rarely seen a film where the son/daughter even directly resembles the parents, but Brancato has the DeNiro nose and everything. If you observe closely, there's a scene where Brancato is wearing a black jacket and a black hat, and if you were to see this in a split-screen with DeNiro in \"Mean Streets\" it would be uncanny. There are so many people I have to commend for this film. That also includes the supporting cast. Taral Hicks as C's love interest was also impressive. And of course, you can't have a movie directed by DeNiro and starring DeNiro without his main amigo making an appearance. Hopefully, you haven't read the cast list on the IMDB. Because I was surprised and overjoyed when \"the man\" appeared in the final scene. There are many lessons on life to be drawn out of this film, some of which given by Chazz's character Sonny, who plays the most likeable gangster I've seen in cinema. Yet at the same time, you can't consider him \"too nice.\" Which was a good move. Sonny was a nice guy in the core, yet he still has a heart of a gangster. In a great monologue, he explains how he'd rather be feared than loved. And of course there's the great monlogue that everyone remembers: the car door scene. That was really an unforgettable speech. Plus, there's funny moments, too. The gambling scene in the basement, for example. \"Get in the f**king bathroom!!!\" LOL...that was hilarious. To add to the emotional intensity, we have an interracial relationship between Brancato and Hicks at a time when Bronx was heavily segregated and whites wanted absolutely nothing to do with blacks. The scene where the boys beat those innocent black boys down was an extremely powerful scene. And through DeNiro's direction, we feel the characters' every emotion. I like how he used the doo-wop music to contribute to the soundtrack. By the end, I was almost at tears. I'm virtually tearing up just writing this review and looking at this masterful drama in retrospect. This is something ONLY Bobby D and Chazz could've done! No one could've done it better! For me to be this deeply moved by a motion picture is unprecedented. I wish I could be thanking the two guys in person. If anyone hasn't seen this movie, please don't hesitate to pick it up! This is one of those great, underrated masterpieces that you feel sad after finding out about its poor success. A film like this really deserves more recognition. And Bobby D....I think you owe a bunch of \"thank yous\" to your buddy Scorcese. He's taught you well. My score: A perfect 10! (out of 10)",
         "The fact that someone is a terrific, legendary and highly talented and celebrated actor doesn't automatically make him a good director. That goes without saying. Robert De Niro is - as we all naturally know - among the best of the best when it comes to acting. I mean he is a pure genius. He chose to make his directorial debut (as well as the only motion picture he has directed so far) out of the fine genre he was so familiar with (after playing Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather: Part II\", David Aaronson in Sergio Leone's \"Once upon a time in America\", Al Capone in Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables\", Jimmy Conway in Martin Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" and so on...) that is, a gangster movie. Surprisingly he ended up directing a masterpiece, at least I think so. Interesting thing is \"A Bronx tale\" is not exclusively for adult viewers. It's a gangster movie all right so it's definitely violent from time to time but intentionally not far as violent as the films of this type normally tend to be. This is a moving, attractive and gripping story about a young boy who has to live between the shadow of two powerful men, his own father (De Niro) and local gangster Sonny (Palminteri in his very greatest role). I just watched \"A Bronx tale\" couple of days ago. I was quite hungry by the time I started to watch it and practically starving by the time of the end credits but there simply wasn't a single scene in this film for me to visit the fridge. I just didn't want to miss one moment - not even one second of sensational \"A Bronx tale\". And people, I've seen this film before. Chazz Palminteri's screenplay was excellent and the story was so utterly enchanting and fascinating there's not enough words to describe it. If this turns out to be the only movie De Niro directs he will certainly be remembered as a great director. \"A Bronx tale\" is one of the best gangster films ever. 10/10.",
         "Oh, what a wonderfully small and intricate film this is! How I love and cherish the world I am pulled into every time I see this film. Robert De Niro's directorial debut proves strong and lively, evidenced by how he stuck to a topic close to home; a young, impressionable Italian kid growing up little Italy in the late 60's. As the naive protagonist Calogero, or 'C' as he is nicknamed, Lillo Brancato gives a great performance as a young man torn between the working-class honesty displayed by his strict father and the ruthless world of organized crime demonstrated by the neighborhood crime boss Sonny (Chazz Palminteri adapted his own play and cast himself as a burly, laid back, world weary know-it-all). One key element that snags you in is the narration. Like equally personal films of its stature (Scorsese's gangster trilogy, \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Election,\" \"Bringing Out The Dead\", \"SLC Punk!\"), the voice-over guiding brings you in even further into the already detailed landscape and story presented. I don't really consider this a mafia movie, it's much more of a coming-of-age tale. However, the background De Niro provides is so intimate and thorough that you wish for another film chronicling the life of Sonny. I have to admit that, for a debut, De Niro's judicious use of music seemed to rival that of Spike or Scorsese in turns of effectiveness. First of all, De Niro kept a much more grass roots approach, sticking to doo-wop, soul, rock, \"mobster pop\" (Dean or Frank) and a little jazz. Whereas Scorsese will use anything at his disposal (\"Casino\" had two Devo tunes in it), De Niro really seems to search for what really makes the scene. My favorite is the scoring of a street fight scene to \"Nights In White Satin\"... De Niro must of knew before we did it was all in the violins. De Niro said he knew this type of story had been done before and didn't want to repeat anything, so he viewed Scorsese's mobster trilogy to see what already had been done. It's obvious he paid attention. Even De Niro himself knows a little Italy gangster film is not complete with at least a surprise-ending cameo from you know who...",
         "I have seen this movie over & over like many of the people who have reviewed it. It's true that this is loosely based on the life of Chazz (C) Palmenteri who wrote the screenplay. Word is that when he was looking to make the play into a movie, he had only one condition, that he play the part of Sonny. He was rejected several times until he found Robert DeNiro & Tribeca productions. What luck for all of us too! Chazz was born to play the role of Sonny & how refreshing to see DeNiro as the humble and hardworking father figure instead of the gangster that he has so often played. This movie has heart & a story that is actually appropriate for young adults. Despite the language & moderate violence (such as the bar scene) there isn't anything graphic (certainly not on the scale of Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan!) and no nudity, just a good story. One of the gems is that nothing is sadder than wasted talent. Thank God that Mr. Palmenteri didn't waste his and shared this wonderful story with all of us. Unforgettable movie, a definite 10 out of 10!",
         "A Bronx Tale does take me back to New York City in the sixties. I grew up in Brooklyn then which certainly has always had its own identity. I'm glad that Chazz Palmentiri has given the Bronx an identity of its own. There are still parts of the Bronx which have the Italian neighborhood you see depicted here. But the Bronx is a Latino majority borough now, ironic when you consider part of the story of A Bronx Tale is the racial tension between the blacks and Italians. The movie divides in two parts, the first is around 1960 with the background of the 1960 World Series, one of the best ever played where the Yankees of Mickey Mantle lost to the Pirates in seven games. Robert DeNiro is your average Joe, a bus driver by profession trying with his wife, Katherine Narducci, to raise their son who is eight years old. Young Francis Capra who is fascinated by the gangsters hanging out at the bar down the street, witnesses the local boss commit a murder. True to the neighborhood code he doesn't snitch to the police and the local boss takes him under his wing. Chazz Palmentiri is the boss and he's an interesting character. A man who's risen to the top of his profession, he's got a sense of himself and what it took to get there. Life is about choices, he made his and he's going with the flow, but he knows it isn't for everyone. He advises young Capra to stay in school, but the more he advises the more fascinating Palmentiri becomes to DeNiro's dismay. The second half of the story is in 1968, the Bronx as part of America ravaged by racial tensions, assassinations and the war in Vietnam. The little boy is now teenager Lillo Brancato who gets interested in a black girl, a big no-no in the crowd he comes from, but Palmentiri is the one person who encourages the relationship. Let's just say that everything, every element of the story comes full circle on one night in the Bronx in 1968. The comparison to Goodfellas for me is obvious. The two kids who grow up to be Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta are taken under the wing of neighborhood boss Paul Sorvino who sees them as promising gangster material and they grow into the roles. Palmentiri keeps telling the young kid here do what I say not what I do, but in the end it takes some tragic events to set him on a right path. DeNiro who you would normally expect in the gangster role is just fine as the father, a good man, not a perfect one by any means, but just a guy trying to do right by his family. It's Palmentiri however who really steals the film as the local gangster boss who's as street smart as they come, but even with all that can't anticipate all contingencies. Lillo Brancato who went on to several other film roles and a long running one in The Sopranos certainly in real life didn't make the same choices as his character Calogero Anello did. Life really imitated art in his life story. Nice to see the Bronx get its due.",
         "The amount of brillance that Robert DeNiro puts into all of his performances is unmatched and he proves that he can also be a fine director by debuting in that field as well as starring in this 1993 Savoy release. DeNiro is top billed but you actually don't see very much of him. The film's major focus is that of a little boy named Calogero and his idol, a mobster named Sonny (Chazz Palminteri). Sonny owns the Bronx neighborhood where Calogero and his honest bus driver father Lorenzo (DeNiro) live. He also basically owns them. Sonny's heavy amount of power and wealth make him an intimidating force throughout the neighborhood but his mob gang make their fear of him look like complete respect. Sonny knows that he's feared and it just encourages him to keep trying to rise in power. Calogero grows up watching Sonny cavorting on the street with his gang and secretly imitating him much to Lorenzo's chagrin. Lorenzo wants the best life possible for Calogero and doesn't want to see him fall into a life of crime or looking up to crime figures. Calogero doesn't listen because he idolizes Sonny too much and his chance to get Sonny's attention comes when he witnesses Sonny fatally shoot a man. When Calogero is questioned by police, his loyalty comes before his conscience and he doesn't rat out Sonny's guilt in the shooting. Sonny strongly appreciates this and so he gives Calogero an easy money job serving drinks for his high rollers gang. As several years pass and Calogero nears the end of his childhood, he must learn to make the ultimate choice between his two \"father\" figures. Just like in \"Goodfellas\", a classic soundtrack and excellent period detail is evident here and this film stands out as yet another classic in the modern day organized crime film genre. Palminteri makes a strong film starring debut and DeNiro makes the very most of his rather small seeming part. Joe Pesci also appears briefly as another respected crime boss. An instant \"new classic.\"",
         "I grew up in the Bronx during the 50s. The story, the neighborhood, the attitude and the values are all real. Maybe the inter-racial line was a bit of a stretch. Those things just didn't happen, at least not so openly. Good story, I own the video & enjoy it with my sons from time-to-time.",
         "Like Marty this is a masterpiece, done on less than a stellar budget. The acting is miraculous. Chazz is a genius who can write for the theater, the film and play the starring role. He is the modern personification of charisma. De Niro plays one of his most engaging and lovable roles. This, my friends, is movie making. No blue screens, no CGI, nothing but a wonderful story, brought to life, as movies were meant to be. Oh yes, the ending is perfect. Being a fellow filmmaker, I can't help but be a little envious at De Niro's first directing job. Directing is hard work, acting is hard work, to act in your first directing effort is...incredible. Well, I shouldn't be surprised. Look at the kind of actor he is. Great film, don't miss it, but please don't wait for the special effects. This is one film that doesn't need them to captivate you. 10/10",
         "The pairing of Chazz P. and Robert DeNiro was an awesome combination. There are just so many scenes in this movie that are brilliant. I also personally thought that this movie was a small bio of Deniro even though it was originally a play by Chazz P. and that Lorenzo and Rose ( which are Cologero Parents) are the same names of Chazz P. real parents.I think this statement from the movie poster says it correctly: This is a story about One man who Lived in the Neighborhood and The Other Man Who Owned It!Thats it! Thats exactly what it was about.A man trying to hold on to his son before the streets swallow him up.From the time Cologero saw Sonny murder a man in front of his house this 9 year old was consumed with the idea of (\"Not Being a Rat)Remember he told his father I didn't rat dad! I didn't rat...and his father says:No son you didn't rat,You Just did a Good Thing for a Bad Man.Everything his father would tell him would always come back to mind sooner or later.Even as he got older,you could still see the struggle his father was going through just to keep his son on the right path..At the end when Sonny got killed Who was there ...his dad. The line I liked was: I never hated Sonny I just didn't like the fact that he was making you grow up so fast.This movie was truly brilliant.I would suggest if you haven't seen it ..Check it out",
         "Here is a realistic-looking and an involving story of the street life in New York City's Bronx section in the 1950s and 1960s. Excellent acting and a good job of re-creating the era and site's atmosphere are main things going for this film. Also the soundtrack is very, very good. The main problem I have with the film is the fact that a cold-blooded killer is made to be the hero - a guy that you root for! Unbelievable. Playing that killer is Chazz Palminteri, who outperforms the more famous and great actor and co-star Robert De Niro. Actually, the co-star is Lilo Brancoto, who was recently in the news for allegedly committing a major crime himself. Anyway, supposedly this is Palminteri's story of his childhood and features him as a young boy and then as a 17-year-old. He has a straight father (De Niro) but looks up to the area's Mafia leader \"Sonny\" (Palminteri), who takes the kid under his wing for not ratting on him when he witnessed him killing someone. It may have a bad message, and gives a couple shots at the Catholic Church along the way, but the characters and the story keeps one tuned to the screen for the full two hours. It was good to see De Niro play the honest, hard-working bus driver who wants his kid to have character and not emulate the local hoods. This is a not a movie for those who wince at the f-word because it's used frequently. This is more of man's movie, really, with males dominating and some good advice on dating and what to look for in women! \"Sonny,\" despite being a killer, is shown to be a caring, compassionate guy who cares about young \"Calogero\" (Brancoto, and earlier as a 9-year-old played by Francis Capra). There are so many mixed messages in here - good and bad - it would make your head swim, but it is a crime film very much worth investigating."

A shooting witnessed by the boy (nicknamed C) is the starting point of a lasting bond between the gangster and the boy. Father (bus driver Lorenzo), however, disapproves.

When C falls for an African American girl, things don't get any easier. C's leap to manhood is marked by tragedy, but also by his recognition of the many faces of love.",
