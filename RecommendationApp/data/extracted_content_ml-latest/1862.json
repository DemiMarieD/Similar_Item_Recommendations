         "The people who are stating that this movie is the worst sequel they've ever seen obviously never saw \"Hercules II\" or \"Jaws 3-D\" or \"Hellraiser II\". Now, I am not about to tell you that this is a great film, but if you set your expectations low, you are likely to have fun. Despite the icky (and variable in quality, though impressive in the last 10 minutes) special effects and the large amounts of blood and t&a, the film never becomes truly disturbing, because you're never meant to take it 100% seriously. Michael Madsen understood that, to be sure, and thanks to his trademarked coolness, he walks away with the picture. As for Natasha Henstridge, she has more or less a supporting part, but one that is rather imaginatively linked to the central story line. Overall, a movie with no artistic pretensions and, undoubtedly, many flaws (someone else already mentioned this; why didn't her head explode when she escaped from the lab?), but watch it in the right frame of mind and it's quite enjoyable. Do you know any other movie that features sex between slimy aliens?!? (**1/2)",
         "In scream 2 the \"horror movie geek\" has a formula which this movie follows to the point. More blood, more gore, higher screams, more sex and more killers. I have seen only but a few good sequels in my time, unfortunately this is not one of them. A BAD MOVIE! (But if you like Natasha H. there are more nude scenes with here in this movie, but I hope that is not enough to make this a good film.)",
         "This was not a great movie. I mean for example, Even NASA (Never A Straight Answer) wouldn't make a six month one way voyage to Mars to spend less than two hours on the planet surface. The premise is hard to buy, but hey, it is science FICTION. The effects are not bad, and the acting is fair. There is a lot of gratuitous sex. Michael Marsden may be the bright spot in this average sci-fi flick. I wouldn't pay to see this in the theatre, but on video.... There are probably worse ways to spend an hour and forty-two minutes.",
         "Yup, it's a crapper. Species I was adequate, but this sequel is not. Bad acting, strained and disjointed, and not much for effects, except for the final several minutes where he and she mutate and do their thing. I'll put up with quite a bit in the interest of sci-fi, but this blows. I'm trying to think of something equally as bad, perhaps those Cyborg movies.",
         "A lot of people must have needed to make house payments, their names listed at the beginning of this film as a testament. Put another way, one could do a Jeff Foxworthyesque comedy bit called \"Your career might be in trouble if...\" and the answer is \"You worked on Species II.\" I have never felt so embarrassed for a group of actors as I had watching these thespians run through painfully stupid dialogue. The script is so inept you have to wonder if it wasn't written by a committee - of middle schoolers. Except for the sex and violence. Or, more succinctly the sexual violence. The filmmakers have some definite problems with women. Unlike the first film, which this outing makes to look like \"2001\" by comparison, here we only see women being ripped bloodily apart, usually during sex. There are bad movies that are fun to watch and laugh at. This turd is not one of them.",
         "After returning from a mission to Mars, a team of experts' tracks down the infected astronaut carrying a parasitic alien before he can meet up and mate with a similar human/alien hybrid. A very rewarding sequel to a fine original, this one turned out to be very enjoyable. By adapting a more straight-up storyline instead of dealing with all the science and facts, there's considerably more action in this one in terms of splattered victims which seems to be the main focus of the first half. With an increase of splatter, there's some great kills and creature make-up used during those scenes, and the tentacled beings covered in slime generate a lot of fun, especially bursting forth from people's stomachs or chasing around the ground which are good times. Several other scenes with the alien children shooting their cocoons together and the effects work there allows even more goopy, gory fun in conjunction with a continuation of fun kills, miraculous healing abilities from both creatures and copious nudity. There are some flaws here, though, namely the decision to allow the captured male into the quarantined zone with the girl when there's plenty of knowledge to indicate his goal is to mate with her, as well as the film's rather tacky CGI during the finale when the practical effects were working so well. It loses some steam in the middle where they keep coming up short in the quest to stop him rampaging and raping woman as they're always on the other end of it, but otherwise there's still a lot to like here. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and attempted rapes",
         "This movie sucks! The original was much better and even it wasn't that good. The only thing this has going for it is the scenes with sex and nudity. Gore fans might like this movie but if your looking for an amazing science fiction/horror experience than watch the ALIEN films.",
         "Of course, killing the alien was no reason to stop the producers from making a sequel. The cliffhanger from the end of part one (a rat with alien DNA might spread it like a disease) was completely ignored though. Although we were told in the original movie, the alien DNA came from light years away, it is now found on Mars (just around the corner in astronomical terms), and astronauts take it home to Earth. Since there was a bit of gore and sex in the first movie, there is a lot more gore and sex in the second one, as if that could improve the quality in any way. We get a lot of cliché characters, from the corrupt senator to the uncompromising general, and the survivors of part one are treated carelessly by the screenplay: Helgenberger lends a willing hand to cruel experiments, Natasha Henstridge returns as the alien's latest clone, but during the whole first hour of the movie, she has nothing to do except sit around in a glass cage. Madsen just needs to run around armed and look cool - he understandably gives a lackluster performance. The sequel was definitely not as intelligent as the original and tries to hide the lack of ideas with gallons of blood. I voted 8/5/6/7 for the 4 parts of the series.",
         "i saw this DVD having never seen SPECIES II before thinking \"i wonder if its as good as the first was?\" and all i have to say in response to watching it is \"how does it only have 3.8/10?\" I didn't have much expectations for it as a sequel but i was pleasantly surprised. Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger return acting just as great as they were in the first film, as did Natasha Henstridge, Justin Lazard was a fantastic choice for his role, Mykelti Williamson, wasn't exactly award winning but he could have been a lot worse, and the same goes for James Cromwell. the special effects were astonishing just as in the first one. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie so i give it 8/10. but my question for all haters of this movie and the first is \"how else should it have been done? with Species rats?\"",
         "This movie definitely wasn't as good as the first one. I thought the original was actually quite entertaining and had quite a good story. This didn't have an as good story and some parts seemed silly. I didn't like the fact that it was the male astronaut doing all the killing instead of Sil. And that is was in Washington D.C instead of L.A. But the action scenes still entertained me and the monsters were pretty cool. I don't know how they got Michael Madsen and the now famous Marg Helenberger to do this sequel ( and I don't know they got Madsen to do the first one either) but there acting was good. Overall I think was a reasonably entertaining movie but don't out of your way to see it."
