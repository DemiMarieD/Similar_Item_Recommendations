      "synopsis": "The Road to El Dorado This is an animation and the voice actors are credited. The songs, by Elton John and Tim Rice, are usually known by titles other than their first lines: both are referenced. The movie opens with the legend of the creation of El Dorado, the city of Gold, by the Divinities, a thousand years ago (Song: 'El Dorado, The Magnificent' ('Our glorious city')). In Spain, 1519, Cortez (Jim Cummings) is preparing to set sail. Playing dice with Zaragoza (Tobin Bell), one of his crew - and with loaded dice! - are con-men Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh), who win a map showing the location of El Dorado, but who are then discovered and, faking an argument between them to distract the crowd, flee: through a set of misadventures involving an escaped bull and a set of narrow streets, they end up inside two water-barrels which are loaded onto Cortez's ship. Discovered at sea, Tulio and Miguel are locked in the brig, but manage to escape with the aid of Altivo, Cortez's horse (Frank Welker), who fetches them the keys in return for an apple. They steal a boat, and (along with Altivo) try to reach land: when they do so, they realize they are at the first marker on the map (a stone shaped like an eagle's head) and so decide to follow the trail to El Dorado (Song: 'The trail that we blaze' ('Look out, New World, here we come'). En route they come across an armadillo, which they save and which accompanies them, and various other markers (the shadow of an eagle, a weeping face, a dragon, etc.) until they come to the final marker, a stone stele bearing an image of the Divinities of El Dorado and their steed, which closely resemble Tulio, Miguel and Altivo. Here Tulio angrily offers 'his half of the big rock' to Miguel: but they are interrupted by a girl, Chel (Rosie Perez), who is running away from El Dorado closely pursued by guards. The guards take everyone by a secret waterway-passage hidden behind the waterfall to the city of El Dorado, where they are met by Chief Tani (Edward James Olmos) and the High Priest, Tzekel-kan (Armand Assante). Hailed as gods (helped by a short start-and-stop of the local volcano) at the coming of the Age of the Jaguar, Tulio and Miguel are taken to their quarters in the temple atop one of the pyramids. Chel, who wants to leave El Dorado, agrees to help them with their scam. The Chief organizes a splendid party for everyone that evening (Song: 'It's good to be a god' ('I hardly think I'm qualified'), which Tulio and Miguel thoroughly enjoy, but they interrupt and stop Tzekel-kan's intended human sacrifice at dawn, also preventing too much of the gold being also tossed into a whirlpool (supposedly the gateway to the spirit realm of Shivalva). The gold is taken to the temple, (there is a cut to Cortez landing and finding the trail), and Tulio and Miguel negotiate a ship from Chief Tani, to be built in three days. At the temple, Tulio is becoming increasingly nervous about the success of the con: he is relaxed by Chel, whilst Miguel sneaks off to see the city (Song: 'The more I learn' (ibid)), where he makes friends with the people. Spotted by Tzekel-kan, Tulio is interviewed by him about how he wants his sacrifices: Tulio and Miguel are then challenged to an Aztec football match, which they win by substituting the armadillo for the ball: however, when offered the sacrifice of the losing team, Miguel reacts angrily, and dismisses Tzekel-kan. The two friends are now drifting apart: Miguel, in an interview with the Chief about the ship, reveals he really wants to stay, and Tulio, increasingly in love with Chel, wants to take her and the gold and leave. Tzekel-kan has however noted that Miguel has cut himself, and 'the gods do not bleed': using a book of magic potions, and the body of his acolyte (Duncan Majoribanks), he brings the giant stone statue of a jaguar to life and under his control. The jaguar pursues Tulio and Miguel across the city and through the volcano to the place of sacrifice above the whirlpool: using a variant of their escape in Spain, Tulio and Miguel trick Tzekel-kan and the jaguar so that both fall into the whirlpool. Tzekel-kan fetches up at the feet of Cortez, and agrees to show him the secret way to the city. In El Dorado, Miguel has decided to stay, and Tulio and Chel to go (Song: 'Friends never say goodbye' ('There isn't much I haven't shared')), and the farewell celebrations and the ship-load of gold are ready when news comes of Cortez's and Tzekel-kan's approach. Tulio decides the only way to save the city is to block the waterway-passage by crashing the ship into its roofs' supporting pillars: to provide extra impetus it is decided to overturn one of the great cisterns near the tunnel entrance. Unfortunately this starts to move faster than expected, and to get the ship clear Miguel has to dive from Altivo's back onto the ship to free the sail. The ship then races down the passage and destroys the roof supports as planned: Miguel, Tulio, Chel and Altivo (and the armadillo) hide to see Tzekel-kan faced with the blocked passage, and Cortez's anger. The guys are saddened at the loss of the treasure - it was SO MUCH GOLD! - but ride off to other adventures. (Credits' song: 'Here comes the night' (ibid)).",

         "Of course, i was missing it too, until about fifteen minutes in. Okay -- the title is \"THE ROAD TO El Dorado\" Hands up, everyone with whom that rings a bell. No? Okay -- its stars are two fast-talking con men who get out of trouble by faking fights with each other,and who *almost* play pattycake at a point. Still no bells ringing? How about if i point out that, at one point, our heroes' images are briefly morphed into the faces of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby for about two frames? Right. This is a tribute to/animated version of those hilarious (if you're in the right frame of mind) \"B\" comedies starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby (and Dorothy Lamour in a sarong -- does Chel look any more familiar, now?), all of which were entitled \"The Road to...\" somewhere or other. Nothing in them was meant to be taken seriously, and very little in this film is. I have to agree with a number of reviewers who say, with varying degrees of indignation, that this is not a kids' film. Duh. It wasn't meant to be. It was meant to ba a general-audience, PG-rated film. WILL you people PLEASE get it through your heads that \"animated\" does not, necessarily, equal \"kids' movie\"? Animation is just another film-making technique, to be used to make any kind of film the animator wants to make, and if you think that animation is automatically for kids, check out... oh, say... \"Akira\" or \"Fantastic Planet\" or \"Heavy Metal\". \"Road to El Dorado\" is an excellent all-ages film, (with the caveat that is IS a PG-rated one, and that you ought to think about what you want your kids to watch) and anyone who sees anything bad or prurient in the scenes that everyone has been complaining about should take a close look at themselves...",
         "One of the few more-modern animated films I still enjoy; maybe that's because it doesn't happen to revolve around \"The power of friendship/love/whatever\" and isn't some sappy love story, like many of Disney's drek has been (though it does have a minor, slightly sleazey love-ish story in the background). Dreamworks is a breath of fresh air in times like these, it would seem. The plot works on many levels; it's straightforward enough for the general kid to understand and enjoy, but is piled under levels of wit and more jokes that rely on understanding more of it, making it balanced and still funny the 150+th time I watch it. The songs are catchy (as can be well-expected from the good man Elton John), the characters are lovable yet total sleazeball con-men, and the humour is on many levels; and with it, it brings many good, memorable lines (\"'For three days?!' 'YES! Don't even breathe!'\" and \"'You're buying your own con!' 'At least I'm not DATING mine!' '... oooh, low blow.'\" come to mind). As a basic rundown, there's Miguel, the fun-loving, more light-hearted of the two con-men; he tends to appreciate the beauty in fun and people. Tulio, the other half of the duo, has a bit more preoccupation with material possessions and wealth, though he still remains human. Then there's Chel; the seducer from the city of gold, able to help the two (at a price). And our main antagonist? Tzekel Khan (spelling unsure), a rather nutsy high priest and speaker for the gods, who proves to be... well, a basket case. The animation pulls itself off well; the movie is bright and colourful, but not a kiddie flick at all- rather, it's humorous on all scales- my friend's 6-year-old-brother, I, and my 55-year-old dad agree. The Road to El Dorado is enjoyable on all accounts. If nothing else, consider renting it.",
         "You probably think the one line summary of this comment is a bit strange, since The Road to El Dorado isn't in fact that old, but what I meant by it is that they do not make feature films like this anymore. Sure every now and then there is a great animated film that revives the Adventure genre of film-making, but that's basically it. If you're an adventure freak like I am and you simply love Indiana Jones or Stargate or The Mummy for all I care you should definitely watch this film. I bet you'll enjoy it, disregarding your age (although very small kid's might get frightened at times). Thank you Dreamworks for providing me with a fantastic story of adventure. I appreciate it. It's been so long since I've seen any good adventure (The Mummy was last and Indy before that). TO ALL STUDIOS I MUST SAY THIS: start making feature films like this again please, I miss them. Does it seem \u0091right' to you that I I have watch an animated film mostly aimed at children, to get a film with a good plot, a good villain, great action, enough thrills, blood and emotion? It does not sound right to me. No Bad Boys II, no Triple X 2, no stupid and expensive action. You can do big with little as long as elements fit together. 8 out of 10",
         "Every new animated film seems to break new ground in technique and execution. Technology and computers have brought animation to new heights of excellence. \"The Road to El Dorado\" is no exception. There is a scene in which Cortez' ship is bearing down on the boat that Tulio (voice of Kevin Kline) and Miguel (voice of Kenneth Branagh) are escaping in -- Miguel looks up and, just before their boat is capsized, yells \"HOLY SHIP!\" Some parents grabbed their children and stormed out of the theater because of what they THOUGHT they heard. If you are going to watch a movie -- PLEASE pay attention and do not jump to erroneous conclusions. The soundtrack with music by (Sir) Elton John and lyrics by Tim Rice has Oscar nomination written all over it. Rosie Perez as 'Chel' is magnificent -- giving just the right amount of innuendo (so the parents will get it) without it being blatantly obvious. She is great -- but then I have always liked her. There is a hint of \"Shangri-La\" about this film... All too rare for an animated film \"The Road to El Dorado\" has a cohesive story and a real plot. While it does drag a bit at times the music helps to move the story along and is always a pleasant diversion. Some of the story was fairly predictable. However, I was wondering right up to the conclusion just how this fable would end. I was pleasantly surprised. It was all wrapped up in a neat package complete with a bow. Of course it left a sequel wide open.",
         "First things first, I am 56 years old and I have to say that I adored this movie. It didn't seem childish or silly at all, on the contrary it had language and dialogue that my 6 year old grandson wouldn't understand! The plot was exciting, the characters deep. Towards the end when I thought that Tulio and Chel were leaving Miguel for good, tears sprang into my watery blue eyes. I almost couldn't stand it! The part in which the chief played ball with the village children was so adorable! The movie wouldn't be complete without it. I also loved the song, \"It's Tough to be a God\" because I couldn't keep from tapping my foot! It was so exciting!!!! All in all, The Road to El Dorado is an awesome animated film and a masterpiece!",
         "What can I say? The Road to El Dorado kept me hooked right from the very start, proving to be an amazing adventure filled with action, comedy, color, breath-taking imagery and music. After The Prince of Egypt, I wasn't too keen on another Dreamworks animated film. Don't ask me why, but Prince of Egypt just failed to reel me in. El Dorado on the other hand has restored my faith in the studio. I'll keep this short and to the point. El Dorado seemed to deliver the goods in every aspect. The music was great and certainly enhanced the mood and scene, Tim Rice and Elton John did a fantastic job with the instrumental score. The characterisation was done quite well, and you could really sense the strong friendship that Tulio and Miguel had with one another. Chel was also a character favorite of mine, and Rosie Perez did a great job providing her voice! The artwork was also exceptionally good, with the colorful Mayan themes and designs providing an amazing backdrop for the story. Of course the film is not without its fair share of eye-candy, the special effects were excellent and Dreamworks didn't go overboard with them. The story was also a nice change. For once it wasn't the tired, rigid old formula of \"good guys meet bad guys, conflict, defeat bad guys and everyone's happy\". I mean..sure everyone is happy in the end...and there is the token good guy VS bad guy routine but Dreamworks seemed to mince it up somewhat and introduce all-new elements. Surely it has its flaws, you say. Well in all honesty, I'm hard pressed coming up with any. I didn't exactly love the character design for Tulio and Miguel but that's just being incredibly petty.... All in all, The Road to El Dorado was very refreshing and a welcome change from the usual Disney-formula-based feature. As for comparisons and similarities with the \"brilliance of Disney\", I believe that there is no need for that talk. I ask you, why do we need more Disney? The Road to El Dorado shines in a light all of its own.",
         "As a new non-Disney animated film debuts I always find myself asking will we ever have one that can match Disney's musical timing and humorous tone. \"The Road to El Dorado\" is one of those that comes really close to being as brilliant as Disney. The films title talks about a path that leads to the mysterious Mayan \"City of Gold\". This myth has been passed down for hundreds of years. In the 1500's a lot of Spanish conquistadors went to the New World in search of this city after it seemed to be impossible to find the \"Fountain of Youth\", the other mythical discovery. This legend was screaming to be a fantasy film. In the Dreamworks interpretation of this legend, we follow the misadventures of two con-artists (voiced by Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline) who accidentally win a treasure map in a craps game. When the game goes sour, the cons hide out in some barrels and end up on a boat bound for the New World. To their bad luck the boat happens to be captained by the most famous of the Spanish conquistadors, Cortez. Thrown in the depths of the ship by Cortez, our two heroes plan their escape. Without spoiling anymore of the film, the two end up in the New World to follow their map. The Dreamworks animators deliver lush rich scenery and delightful characters. These characters and scenery were a lot like the brilliance found in Disney's \"Jungle Book\" and last year's amazing \"Tarzan\". If you remember back to \"Prince of Egypt\" we had that magnificent look and the celebrity voices but no real memorable relationships. The intricate relationships between the characters in this film is one more step ahead forward Dreamworks. But what the film lacked was a real memorable song. The team of Elton John and Tim Rice, who dreamed up the brilliant soundtrack of the \"Lion King\", really never deliver a solid song that your kids will be singing weeks after the film. The songs here really have no heart but instead just play during some of the weaker scenes of the film. Now all they have to do is deliver musical songs and a musical score we will want to listen to after the film closes. Disney still reins supreme as head animation studio. But watch out Mickey, Dreamworks is one step behind. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",
         "This has got to be one of the most hilarious animated movies of all time. The situational comedy is truly amazing. The voice acting is well done as well however the song are a little disappointing, coming from the duo that brought us the soundtrack of The Lion King. Only a couple are good. However the comedy and the great visuals definitely make up for it. This movie is definitely a must see!!! Rating: 10/10",
         "Let me start by saying that I liked 'The Road to El Dorado'. It has some nice songs, good animations and it was very funny. I especially liked the horse Altivo. The thing that bothered me is that most of the things on screen I had already seen in other movies. Well, one in particular. Two guys come to a strange place. They are mistaken for Gods because a miracle happens by accident. They have a plan to steal the gold in that place, but one of them wants to stay. This is 'The Road to El Dorado' but also 'The Man Who Would Be King' from 1975 starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine. Here we Tulio and Miguel voiced by Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. They have the same funny chemistry as Connery and Caine had. In 'The Road to El Dorado' we have also a love interest, Chel (voice by Rosie Perez), and a high priest named Tzekel-Kan (voice by Armand Assante) who doubts the divinity of the two men. I liked it, but not because it was very original. If you haven't seen 'The Man Who Would Be King' you are able to enjoy this movie also for the story. Anyway, you will not be bored.",
         "There is nothing much that is bad that is to be said about this film. The characters, Tulio and Miguel, were fun, entertaining, and the plot itself was much the same way. I was surprised, however (though not necessarily disappointed), at how Disney-like this movie was, coming from Dream Works. Dream Works tends to go for a more \"crude\" or \"sarcastic\" humor. They don't seem to like using two scrawny, goofy men as main characters or having an antagonist that is so evil that you can hardly express how evilly evil he is. Both of these were present in the movie, as well as a scene where Tulio and Miguel *gasp* dance and sing! Verrrrry Disney-like if you ask me. Either way, I found the movie to be excellent. It is nothing that makes your jaw drop in absolute awe, but it makes your side hurt aplenty. The music was very fitting, and sounded beautiful. The animation stunned me, even though the movie had been more than 5 years old when I saw it the first time (perhaps showing Dream Works animation superiority over Disney?) I would definitely recommend it for if you are looking for a good laugh."

The pair follow a map to the secret city where their loyalty will be tested: do they return home rich men or continue to live in this paradise?

         "In 1517, Spanish-wanted street swindlers Miguel and Tulio's uncanny luck gets them a map to El Dorado and a stowaway passage, albeit in Cortez's stocks destined for floggings and slavery on Cuba. They escape, thanks to the war horse Altivo; a storm brings them on a Mexican shore fitting the map, so they enter the city, where high priest Tzekel-Kan welcomes them as the prophesied gods, accidentally confirmed by a volcanic rumble. Only temple thief Chel sees trough their game, so she's allowed into the scam to steal the golden treasure. They abolish human sacrifices and learn the high-priest rivals for power with the chief, so they play them against each-other. Meanwhile Cortez arrives and follows the tramps' trail. When Tzekel-Kan tricks Tullio into reintroducing sacrifices, the river of blood tradition requires to start the jaguar age, Miguel braves him, making a dangerous enemy who uses black magic having realized they're mortal.
