         "I got the feeling when I watched this that someone had written a nice script about minor league baseball, and somebody got a hold of it and said, \"Hey, let's just make this a 'Major League' movie!\" I got the feeling the characters from the previous two movies were just tacked onto the existing story line. Which is bad, because there were some good things in this, like the old (actually, ancient) minor league outfielder who was converted to first. And the young phenom hitter. Not Bull Durham, but could have been good.",
         "Some have wondered why the Cleveland Indians are not even mentioned in the third installment of the \"Major League\" series. Here's why, plus my notes on this movie: 1) Between 1994 and 1998, when this movie was released, the real Cleveland Indians made the playoffs every year and went to the World Series twice. There's no fun, and really no point, in making a movie about underdogs when the real-life team is one of the best in baseball. This is why the producers did not focus on the Tribe, but partially on the then-hapless Minnesota Twins. The only scene where you even see a reference to the Indians is in a Sporting News article Gus is reading while riding the bus, describing the Tribe as contenders. (a side note: I've been a die-hard Indians fan for 30 years, so I may sound a bit prejudiced here) 2) I wish we would have known whether the Tribe won the World Series after Major League 2 ended. My guess is no, because I think it would have been mentioned if the Tribe had come out on top. None of the principals (Pedro, Rube, or even Dorn) sport rings in this movie, but even the pennant winners get smaller rings (I've seen the ones the Tribe received for winning the AL pennant in 1995 and 1997...they are very nice indeed). 3) We know that Pedro left baseball and came back, now seeking Christianity, apparently with some voodoo mixed in, since a ragged looking Jobu makes a cameo here. Dennis Haysbert, who played Pedro Cerrano in all three movies, could win five Oscars and be hailed as the greatest actor ever, and to me he will ALWAYS be Pedro Cerrano. 4) It is mentioned that Rube Baker (Eric Bruskotter, who to me will also be one of Ronald's friends from \"Can't Buy Me Love\"), who had a home run and an important double in the ALCS in MLII, had been playing with the San Diego Padres before being released. This indicates that the Indians finally got fed up with his throwing problems and invested in a real catcher. 5) Wild Thing and Jake Taylor are nowhere to be seen. My guess is that Ricky Vaughn would have still been with the Tribe, with Jake Taylor as the Indians' manager. They did win a pennant, after all. 6) Gus Cantrell (Scott Bakula) must have played with some of these players in the Tribe's minor league system at one time. That's how Pedro, Rube, and Dorn know who he is. 7) Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) recovered from having to sell the Tribe in MLII, resurfacing as the owner of the sad-sack Twins. His character is much more mature and likable here. I couldn't stand Dorn in the first two movies. 8) Harry Doyle's (Bob Uecker) drinking problem finally caught up with him and forced him out of the Indians' broadcast booth, probably after cursing the Tribe out for losing the World Series. He tells Gus on the bus, after they pull up to the Metrodome, that it had \"been a while\" and \"what a year to quit drinking\". It seems that Doyle had finally licked his alcoholism. 9) Tanaka apparently took his World Series share and opened that mini golf course you see in the movie. Don't forget, he was a veteran of Japanese baseball when the second one came out, and his part was mostly played for laughs. In 1994, the only player of Japanese origin in the bigs was Hideo Nomo. Now, with Ichiro and others becoming stars, it's almost commonplace. Even the Tribe has Kaz Tadano, a pretty fair relief pitcher, in their system. 10) Finally, this movie is better than the second one. It's not as good as the first one, but MLI oozes so many curses and obscenities that I wouldn't let my kids watch it, if I had any. The second one is much cleaner, but halfway through seeing it the first time, I knew it was a bad movie (even though seeing my beloved Cleveland Indians win the pennant on celluloid covers a multitude of sins). This one is a good Sunday afternoon time waster. It's not that bad.",
         "I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and find myself watching it when it comes on TV. I'm not sure why several other 'reviewers' are getting so fired up about why Charlie Sheen or Wesley Snipes are not in the movie, or why the Indians have been replaced by the Twins: this is the Major League franchise, friends, not the Godfather trilogy. Just accept this as a nice little movie focused on minor league ball, jokes, and Ted McGinley's overacting. It's not going to save the world, or win an Oscar, but it's certainly enjoyable. If you have to compare the 3 movies, the first one is the best, then I'd put this one because it's not trying so hard to repeat the original, then the 2nd one, because, well, that one's just very bad: worse than drinking Jobu's rum. (Although the look on Berenger's face in the second one when he has to say \"okay, Rick, let's get nasty\" is priceless, I have to admit). Major League 3 doesn't try to do too much, so don't expect much out of it, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",
         "I think of Major League: Back to the Minors is a pretty good spin off of the first two Major League movies. Writer-director John Warren has put together a film that has the same feel as the first two. He has also done a good job of having some familiar faces, as well as introducing us to some new ones. In the beginning, we are introduced to Gus Cantrell, played by Scott Bakula. Gus is a professional baseball pitcher who has spent a lot of time in the minor leagues. Gus knows that he is too old to be playing professional baseball. That is when Roger Dorn (played by Corbin Bernsen, reprising his role from the first two films) comes along with a job offer. Roger offers Gus the job to be the manager of his AAA team, the Buzz. It is up to Gus to turn this group of guys into a legitimate baseball team. With this Buzz baseball team, we have an interesting group of players. We have a bunch of new faces. One of them is Hog Ellis, a pitcher who only has a fastball in his repertoire. Carlton \"Doc\" Windgate is a starting pitcher who is good at locating and controlling his pitches, but has the slowest fastball in all of professional baseball. Frank \"Pops\" Morgan has been playing minor league ball for two decades and never made it to the majors. Twin brothers named Juan Lopez play second base and shortstop. Lance Pere is a third baseman who was once a ballet dancer. Finally, we have Billy \"Downtown\" Anderson as a young up-and-coming hitter who needs some fine tuning. Along with the new faces, we have some familiar ones. Rube Baker, who was an Indians catcher in the second Major League film, is back as the Buzz catcher. Voodoo man Pedro Cerrano is back to help Gus make the Buzz a good team. Along with Cerrano is his crazy Japanese buddy, Taka Tanaka. The story focuses on one season where at first the Buzz is the joke of all AAA teams. But under Gus's coaching, they become a team good enough to compete with its major affiliate, the Minnesota Twins. I think the story and film are fun and entertaining, especially if you are a fan of the first two Major League films or even just baseball at all. The only thing I still can't get my mind past is how is it possible for both the Buzz and the Twins to find time out of their seasons to play against each other.",
         "Man, this is Scott back to his best. Even more polished than the famed and acclaimed Quantum Leap. Pure class!! This film had me in stitches. Both times I watched it!!! Wow, and he is more than abley backed up by his arch enemy Leonard Huff. Pure genius.",
         "I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Sure, the original is the best and the second had it's fair share of moments. But I found this one to pretty entertaining and my favorite of the three. It has a lot of humor and (unlike most comedies of the 90s) doesn't result to insulting the audience's intelligence. It's a movie that wants nothing more than to make you laugh, and it does a great job at that. Scott Bakula (as always) is good, and Ted McGinley is appropriately weasley as the coach of the opposing team. I won't give it away, but the scene involving McGinely, a baseball, and the wall of the dugout is one of the funniest gags in the entire movie that had me laughing long after the scene had ended. Bob Ueker (who was hysterical in MAJOR LEAGUE and MAJOR LEAGUE II) gets a little stale this time around, but still gets in some funny moments. If only the lovely Jensen Daggett had been given a bit more to do. But the film is funny and worth a look if you're in the mood for a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.",
         "The one lesson Hollywood has never learnt, is to give up on something when it's been done to death. For instance, the 1st 3 Police Academy movies were good, the remaining 3000 of them weren't. The same thing happened to the Major League movies, the 1st was brilliant, the 2nd was mediocre with some excellently funny moments dotted about here and there and the 3rd was terrible. This is not because Major League 3 - Back to The Minors is rubbish, far from it. I found it to be a very entertaining movie. What killed it dead, was the decision to make it part of the Major League franchise. This movie could have easily stood on its own two feet as just another great baseball movie. Instead, in a bid to tie it in with the two movies that came before, we have a movie that just tries too hard to live up to a reputation that had already been destroyed by Major League 2. With the exception of 3 or 4 cast members, most of the original actors did not return for this outing and what we're left with is a contrived plot for the actors that did just to tie this in with the franchise. Roger Dorn, (Corbin Bernsen), now completely retired from playing, is now the owner of the Minnesota Twins and all the affiliated feeder clubs associated with them. He hires his old teammate and washed up pitcher Gus Cantrell, (Scott Bakula), to manage his AAA team The South Carolina Buzz, who like in the 1st movie, are a bunch of no talent misfits until Cantrell licks them in to shape. Already with the Buzz are Rube Baker, (Eric Bruskotter), who is later joined by old Indian's Teammate Pedro Cerrano, (Dennis Haysbert). Just to give that very much unneeded link to the past. On a visit to see Roger, Gus is reunited with another old team mate of his, the vain and extremely arrogant Leonard Huff , (Ted McGinley). It is evident that these two men detest one another and have done for years. Huff is always ready to belittle Gus regarding what he perceives as his failed career and his minor league status, and Gus despising Huff's brutal and arrogant style of baseball management. More out of rivalry than for entertainment, an Exhibition match is set up for the Buzz to play the Twins at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, (Sadly now demolished). Realising the Buzz are on the verge of winning, Huff fakes a power cut to try to save some face. However, the press have latched on to the rivalry and tension between Gus and Huff and require a definitive winner to the grudge match and both sets of players are merely pawns in a private war between the two managers. Only this time, Gus insists that the Twins play at their ballpark. ML3 is a really entertaining movie, ruined by a desire to shape it in to something it didn't need to be. Whilst I won't begrudge any actor their pay cheque, The Roger Dorn character didn't need to be Roger Dorn, Cerrano didn't need to be Cerrano and no character from the previous 2 movies needed to be revived for this to be a good film. In fact, it would have been better had they not done this at all. However, one character that did return that I was genuinely glad to see, was the brilliant Bob Uecker reprising his role of wisecracking sportscaster Harry Doyle. Most of the movie's belly laughs come from his droll commentary and his rivalry with his stuffed shirt Minnesota counterpart. One annoying aspect of the movie is the annoying Guitar riff that's played every time a cast member utters the name of the Twin's star player and resident psychopath Carlos Liston, played well by Lobo Sebastian. Bakula is really good here and so is McGinley. McGinley is often given a lot of stick by some for overplaying his characters. His character here is worthy of some overplay as he should be a figure of dislike and ridicule and McGinley made the character of Leonard Huff exactly as he should be. For the guys, Jensen Daggett plays Bakula's love interest and very pleasing on the eye she is too and it's a shame she hasn't done a great deal since. A great little movie, but sadly, one only created to sit in the shadow of it's big brothers. However, sometimes even the runt of the litter can stand up for itself. Enjoy!!!",
         "I can't speak for the franchise it's based off of. I saw \"Major League\", the original movie, once and to be honest, was rather disappointed that it wasn't as good as \"Back to the Minors\", which I had seen several times at that point. Since other reviews have done a good job describing it, but may contain spoilers, I'll try to give the flavor in this one without the spoilers. BTTM is a great baseball movie for sitting back with some popcorn and having a laugh. It's a bit like \"The Sandlot\" except geared more towards adults in terms of story-line and humor. That's not to say kids can't watch it. There isn't a ton of swearing (one or two words) and nothing over the top sexually (unless you count a woman wearing a nice bathrobe.) I'm perfectly fine with letting my 9yr old baseball playing son see it, but some of the story might be a bit over his head. The movie has lots of unique/memorable characters, a solid underdog story-line, and lots of humor sprinkled through-out. The humor is largely visual gags and some verbal word play. It's light on mean-spirited and crass humor. This was something that I found less than appealing about the original (from what I recall, it was over a decade ago at this point), it seemed to rely more on that sort of humor, which I'm not a huge fan of in those kinds of doses and would certainly not let my son watch at this age. Good movie for former baseball and fastpitch softball players who may be reminded of former coaches (both good and bad) and crazy teammates. Might even be a good family movie for parents with slightly older children, but you'd want to view it first to make certain it's a good fit for you.",
         "Gus Cantrell (Scott Bakula) is an aging minor league baseball pitcher who knows all the tricks. Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) hires him to manage his minor league team with a great prospect in over-confident Billy Anderson (Walton Goggins). Rube Baker (Eric Bruskotter) is back with the same problem as before. Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert) returns to baseball after spending time away searching for something. Taka Tanaka (Takaaki Ishibashi) has opened a putt-putt golf course but he's tired of the business. He also joins this ragtag AAA team. When faced with old nemesis Leonard Huff (Ted McGinley), he gets into a challenge between his minor league team and Huff's Minnesota Twins. I love Scott Bakula as an actor, but it's a mistake to put him in the lead. If Dennis Haysbert is willing to come back, then it would be much better to have Cerrano as a new coach. People love the franchise because of not just baseball but the characters as well. It just makes sense to have an original character as the lead. I also didn't find Walton Goggins that believable as the new young prospect. He's not that young looking, and he needs more muscle to be a big hitter. And losing the Cleveland Indians doesn't help although that may be beyond the filmmakers' control. That's not a rub against The Twins. It's just that the franchise started with the Indians and there's a history.",
         "Not bad for the third in a series based on the same concept. Scott Bakula appears as the out of options old man manager for a minor league team. He has a great approach to managing his team. The roping of the two Juan's together to shorten their range so each covers the appropriate range for their respective positions is priceless. He turns \"Downtown\" in to a complete hitter after he returns from his shot at the majors where he couldn't hit any thing but a fastball. Pops Morgan is a pretty much washed up player who just can't let go of the \"dream\". I like it when they find Tanaka at a mini-putt putt golf course with his family. He is convinced to return to pro ball. Dennis Haysbert returns for the third time as Pedro Cerrano, the power hitting but superstitious player. Corbin Benson is back as the smarmy owner of a major league team that plays the minor one on a dare. I like the face down between Liston and the pitcher. This results from a little talk that Bakula had with him about the mechanics of pitching. Ted McGinley plays the manager of ther Twins and he just can't understand why they get beat. This is a decent follow up movie for the series."

Gus ends up clashing with Leonard Huff, the snobby, arrogant manager of the twins. One night in Minnestoa, Gus and his girlfriend Maggie Reynolds are having dinner with Roger and Huff at an expensive-looking restaurant, where Huff challenges Gus to a game between the Buzz and the Twins, then Huff starts a fight with Gus, who accepts the challenge. The game is scheduled to take place at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minnesota. The Twins take a 3-0 lead in the 6th inning, but Billy hits a home run that ties the game at 3-3 in the 8th inning, but in the top of the 9th inning, with two outs, while the Twins are up to bat, and Doc is one strike away from striking out bullying home run hitter Carlos Liston, Huff has the stadium's lights turned off so the game can end with a tie rather than give the Buzz a chance to win in the bottom of the 9th, and the media says that the Twins were still outplayed by the Buzz. Huff now wants to bring Billy up to the Twins, even though Billy is not yet ready to go up to the Twins. Billy jumps on the opportunity and turns his back on Gus. Without Billy, the Buzz start losing again. With the Twins, Billy starts hitting poorly, proving Huff wrong about Billy. Gus manages to get the Buzz back on track, and Billy is sent back down to the Buzz, where Gus teaches Billy how to hit for a higher batting average. Gus leads the Buzz to a division title in their league, then Gus issues a challenge for Huff to bring the Twins to Buzz stadium for another game. The way Gus has issued the challenge, if the Twins win, he'll give his salary for the year to Huff, and if Gus and the Buzz beat the Twins, Gus can take over as the manager of the Twins. Huff accepts the challenge and takes the Twins to South Carolina to play against the Buzz. This time, the Buzz are determined to complete the game and beat the Twins."],
