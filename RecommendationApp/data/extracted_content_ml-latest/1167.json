         "\"Dear God\" is the rare example of a movie that starts abysmally but slowly gains its stride. Most films these days are the opposite. They grab you right off, then run out of steam. To be fair, \"Dear God\" never fully grabs you or has much steam. But it gets to the point where it becomes worth watching, eliciting several pleased chuckles, while still falling far short of out-and-out funny. Greg Kinnear plays a two-bit hustler whose honest face and convincing stories allow him to con working joes out of their money. He has a gambling debt to repay to Junior, an overweight thug who teaches him a lesson or two about horses and stables at a disastrous visit to the track. Kinnear's Tom Turner is arrested while trying to scam two undercover cops disguised as foreign sight-seers, and in a ridiculous plot convenience, is sentenced to find a paying job for one year. Most criminals should be so lucky. But of course, Turner has that honest face. Anyway, he ends up at the post office, where he's assigned to a dead letter office filled with whacko postal cast-offs, played with sufficient nuttiness by Laurie Metcalf, Jon Seda and Tim Conway, among others. Conway's character once memorized the entire layout of the city of L.A., but was demoted when he lost it and bit a dog. Metcalf plays a former lawyer who needed a \"less stressful\" job. You get the idea. Through a series of accidents, this motley crew begins answering letters to God, and, through their limited means, they begin making minor miracles happen throughout L.A. The press picks up on it, which draws the attention of the U.S. Postmaster General (played with his usual rabid energy by the director, Garry Marshall), and brings heat on the do-gooder crew, whose activities are technically illegal. (Opening the mail is a federal offense). Meanwhile, Kinnear's Turner remains on the run from the gangsters and tries to woo a single mother played by the adorable Maria Pitillo, whose character has no function in this film other than as a weak romantic interest. Extraordinarily lame-brained from the get-go, \"Dear God\" actually gets on course, as the relative uniqueness of its storyline manifests itself in some sweet, quiet moments, and as the ensemble group of veteran actors really begins to relish their roles. Metcalf is always funny, although she's a little over the top here, and Kinnear is notable for his ability to play a likeable everyman. Conway has a very-funny apology scene with a dog and is otherwise likeable in his eccentricity. The movie ultimately only reaches the level of so-so -- but I guess the fact that I felt compelled to write about it means that it made some impact on me, and that I can marginally recommend it. 5 out 10.",
         "Tom (Greg Kinnear) is a petty conman who poses as a burn victim (among other things) to elicit money from innocent bystanders. He has quite a reputation around town so law enforcement goes to some length to catch him in the act. Brought in front of a judge, she decrees that he will get a real job or end up in the pokey. So, a job it is for him. Tom has his eye on a pretty lady named Gloria, anyway, so it might help his image with her, too. Strings are pulled to get him into the postal service's dead letter office. Once there, surrounded by kind and interesting people, he begins to turn his life around. He even reads some of the letters addressed to God and performs random acts of kindness. What could be wrong with that? This movie leaves the viewer with feelings of great joy. Kinnear is a charmer, in every way, and with cast members such as Maria Pitillo, Tim Conway, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Hector Elizondo, he is in great company. The script has a buoyant message to give about helping others, only to receive kindness back in return. How nice the settings and costumes are, too. A love story develops quietly for any viewer who longs for comedies with romance. This film is recommended for individuals or families who need their faith restored in humanity, but who also enjoy laughter and nonsense along the way.",
         "\"Dear God\" is a movie the whole family can enjoy. Despite a predictable plot and an ending anyone can spot a mile away, the overall ensemble acting and dialogue are surprisingly fresh and sometimes poignant. The conversion of Tom from a conniving con who thought of every angle to profit himself to a do-gooder is gradual and quite convincing, avoiding a common pitfall of many feel-good movies. Jaded cynics may sneer at the religious tone, but it is actually not about any religion but about the uplifting experience one can gain by helping each other. The cast of Kinnear, Metcalf, Pitillo mixed with old pros like Conway, Elizondo and Browne really deliver. Conway is especially enjoyable, a scene stealer up to his old tricks, and Metcalf is deliriously wacky. A special mention goes to the director, Gary Marshall, using subtle yet funny touch to parody the American media and court system. Overall, this movie is very delightful for everyone who is not a total cynic. Rating: 8/10.",
         "sorry this may not be for cynics at heart, but if in for a LightHearted less seriousness laugh of it all...non conforming but simulative... it was quite funny with a long-term feel ideal in a markable way...just stumbling onto this film from a Canadian inside-workers perspective and insiders-production's views, offers insiders laugh and a half, outdated in areas of course, but... it has splitting laughter parts that can be watched over and over and or feeling down-times brings a simple uplift if one does not come into it with an already harsh-eye...yes, sentimentally-sappish in a sheepish way, hints of gmashall-comedy to the fans and similar details of kinnear humorous-ways of the past. It is what it is and they are who they are...just on screen, for it's environment. It's a search to stumble upon, as myself, to make this lost past treasure into simplicity, hints and twists on Santa wishes/wishes as Be-wishes in an angelical light-miracle adult-sense of pay it forward ways with fittingly music to round it off...postmarked and mailed...make that emailed :) to scape into chuckles when you need an uplift in a different light, rather non-dark to note. Thumbs up in letters!",
         "I just love this movie. It is funny and heartwarming. It has a happy ending. Laurie Metcalf is unforgettable along with a stellar cast. It may not be the best movie but it is fun to watch and enjoy. Tim Conway is unbelievable as a burned out postman. Laurie Metcalf as a burned out lawyer. Greg Kinnear who joins this zany group of people who are ordinary and do something to make themselves extraordinary people. It gives you a warm feeling by the end of the movie. Please rent or buy this movie. It's fun for the whole family. I love watching Rue McClanahan and Jack Klugman. The story might be flawed but it's always worth watching especially around the holidays when you need a little cheering up to do. Greg Kinnear is a good actor who is working at being a good film actor.",
         "Greg Kinnear is Tom Turner, small time con artist who apparently never works, gambles, loses, and is forever in debt. He gets a few bucks here, a few bucks there, working any number of scams. Until police on a sting catch him trying to sell worthless airline tickets to what he thinks are a foreign couple. He is arrested, and in court is given a choice -- get and hold a job for at least a year, or go to prison. |He had to think about it, but took the job option. The judge figured he needed to experience how it was to work for money, since he was accustomed to taking what others had worked for. He manages to get a job with the post office, in the DLO -- the dead letter office. That's where letters to such personalities as Elvis, Santa, and GOD went. Still having 'scam' firmly in his mind, part of his scheme was to eventually get money from the letters. But first he had to do something fantastic. A Garry Marshall film. Tim Conway is his usual funny self, as Herman Dooly, a mail man who was assigned inside duty after he bit a dog. Hector Elizondo is good as the supervisor, Vladek Vidov. SPOILERS. Under Tom's influence, they begin to select letters to GOD, open them, and find people to help. As a result lots of money often came in. |Gradually Tom had a change of heart, began to reject his dishonest life and see the benefit of doing good. However he went to trial again, for violating postal regulations, in opening mail. Everyone rallied to his support, he got off, and got the girl too.",
         "I could say that 'Dear God' strains hard to be Capra-esqe if I ever felt that the movie was straining to do anything at all. This is the kind of movie written at the level of a fourth-rate sitcom by people trying to hurry up and write something \u0096 anything because they had big plans for lunch. What disappoints me most is that it begins very well. I always love movies about small time con men who try every trick in the book to separate suckers from their money and here Greg Kinnear plays such a guy who tries everything from selling phony airline tickets to making a phony accident claims to pretending to be a burn victim wrapped in bandages. Eventually his scams land him in front of a judge who issues him community service by working the Los Angeles Post Office. This is where the movie goes flat. Kinnear ends up in the basement of the dead letter office, which is populated by characters who seem to have been rescued from failed sitcoms. They are types instead of people. We meet a former lawyer (Laurie Metcalf), a disgrunted postal worker (Tim Conway), a man very close to his retirement (Roscoe Lee Browne) and a Russian immigrant (Hector Elizondo). Nobody acts like themselves but instead spout inane one-liners which seem all the more stilted without a laughtrack. Kinnear's job is to sort out letters to Santa Claus, The Tooth Fairy, the Easter bunny, Elvis and of course God. He begins reading the letters and we don't have to guess that next he begins answering those letters and doing good deeds for everyone. The movie is all sugary sweet as the office workers keep a man from committing suicide and give a woman the day off and help someone with their housework. The good deeds capture the attention of the media who dubs them 'The Postal Miracles' and has late breaking news reports to report the progress. I could have won side bets that the movie was going to end up with a painfully unfunny courtroom scene but I swear I could never have guessed the moment the Metcalf begins gyrating in the aisles. Thinking it over I really can't remember the last time a good comedy that climaxed in a courtroom. 'Dear God' establishes a promising premise. Putting a small time con artist in the post office means that there are all kinds of comic possibilities to be had. But 'Dead God' isn't written with possibilities in mind, it's written at the level of a fourth rate sitcom that would have been cancelled.",
         "Well it's no \"Miracle on 34th Street\", but this is an entertaining enough flick that has it's humorous moments. I mention that classic film because I felt it was heading to a similar resolution, but that would have been too blatant a rip-off. Greg Kinnear turns out to be a likable con-man once he answers a 'Dear God' letter and accidentally inserts some cash in an envelope, thereby brightening up someone's day. Thereafter he's joined by a disparate cast of fellow employees who want to get in on the feel-good feeling of being regular people doing their own brand of miracles. Laurie Metcalf is a trip as the frazzled ex-lawyer who winds up having her day in court, and I got a kick out of Tim Conway doing one of his best Carol Burnett show gimmicks as a clueless mail sorter. Also a hoot were the dead letter bins labeled for such ephemeral entities as Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny - and wouldn't you know it, even Elvis! Which all goes to show that you can go postal without actually going postal.",
         "Greg Kinnear plays a compulsive gambler who is in debt to a loan shark. He must get a job after appearing in court and getting offered a choice between going to jail and getting that job. He winds up at the Post Office for the Christmas period and when he inadvertently opens up a letter to God. For some reason he decides to answer it with some jewelry he steals from the Post Office dead letter files. When he sends his cashed paycheck along it is an accident and he chases it but can't get it. The rest of the dead letter staff gets the spirit and things keep giving. There are several well known actors in this movie and they do an excellent job. Tim Conway, Laurie Metcalf, Hector Elizondo (although it is a reach to see a Hispanic having to portray what I guess is suppose to be a Russian accent), and Roscoe Lee Brown. When Brown gets pinched for giving a horn to a bum musician he gets grabbed by the Feds. Greg comes forward and says he did it all. At trial the whole gang comes forth and states they are the leader. Of course all ends well for the good guys.",
         "I don't know what you guys are talking about, because I think this was one of the most feel-good, positive, and uplifting movies ever made. I own it, and I never get tired of watching it. It has a lot of heart and reminds me of the movie, Field of Dreams."

         "Tom Turner is a con man, defrauding people from their money with a variety of two-bit hustles. One night he makes the mistake of attempting to hustle some undercover cops, and finds himself in court faced with the dilemma of either going to jail or getting a real job. Choosing to stay out of jail, he gets a job at the post office working in their Dead Letter Office helping to sort Dead Letters (i.e. mail which, for whatever reason, can't be delivered). Some of the mail he recieves can't be delivered because it's addressed to God, and he accidentally answers (sending them money in the process). This starts the ball rolling as more of his co-workers get in on the idea of helping people by answering \"God\" mail.",
         "When letters written to God start getting results, and replies, people everywhere are amazed. The Post Office however is annoyed."
