         "Spoilers follow, but it hardly matters. Cosmetic amputation, timelapse of rotting corpses. siamese twins fathering twins, bias against black and white animals, a crooked vet who is a Vermeer counterfeiter, and multiple suicides all to children's music. Forget all that. It is just a framework for lush compositions and an ornate allegorical framework. Pretentious? Preposterous? Predicatory? Naah. This is a wonderful film, much richer symbolically than `Cook,' a stronger narrative than `Drowning,' better photography and music than `Belly,' of the following year. A good Greenaway is something to be relished. Which is the best Greenaway? This is the best start, I think. `Prospero's Books' and `The Pillow Book' are the most accomplished without compromise. I rank this with `The Draughtsman's Contract,' and `Drowning by Numbers;' all three have concessions to an understandable narrative. `The Falls' is a must, but takes discipline. But with this film, he has temporarily abandoned the layering and successive self-referential annotation that is his most unique contribution to the art. The only such effort is the thread of a film about the origin of life that is interwoven. One twin searches it for the red herring among the clues, the red herring that explains the trumping of randomness over purpose. Before viewing, it helps to view the 26 Vermeer paintings.",
         "I knew how strange and unusual Greenaway could be but Zed, I believe could take the cake :). I am not sure what it is all about but I still enjoy the triumvirate Greenaway - Sasha Verny- Michael Nyman. Some ideas and images Greenaway will use in the later \"8 1/2 women\" and \"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover\" - especially, the soundtrack. \"Dead Ringers\" and \"Mon oncle d'Amérique\" (two beautiful weirdnesses themselves) also come to mind while watching Greenaway's elegant tale of decomposing which is also his meditations about life, death and grief. As in earlier \"The Draughtsman's Contract (1982), Greenaway explores the relationship between the close relatives - the twin brothers are in the center of \"A Zed & two Noughts\". The movie is also a modern retelling of an ancient myth about Leda and Zeus who took the form of a swan and slept with Leda on the same night as her husband, King Tyndareus. Leda bore Helen and Polydeuces, children of Zeus while at the same time bearing Castor and Clytemnestra, children of her husband Tyndareus, the King of Sparta. Greenaway considers that 90% of his films one way or another refers to paintings. \"A Zed & two Noughts\" refers openly and with great admiration to the paintings of Johannes Vermeer van Delft. \"A Zed & two Noughts\" is not easy film to watch, its characters are not sympathetic, it lacks warmth and sentimentality but as always in Greenaway's films, it is a feast for eyes, ears, and for brain. 7.5/10",
         "ZOO is a film based upon the symmetry involved in nature. Two brothers (born as Siamese twins now separated) both lose their wives in a car crash caused by a pregnant swan flying into their car. It turns out that both women were expecting. The two brothers both mourn the passing of their wives and unborn children and become increasing obsessed with life and death, particularly the transition between the two states. The Brothers happen to both work in a zoo as vets and use the zoos equipment in ever more bizarre experiments to observe the process of decay via time lapse photography (the results of which are shown frequently throughout the movie). The film progresses via a series of well thought out scenes, the visual content of which are more important than either the action or the plot. Greenway continues to explore the necessity of symmetry in nature and also its artistic merit. This however, is a subterfuge for the real meaning of the film, which is the realization of man that he lives alone in a Godless and empty universe where life and both its beginning and ending seem purposeless. A visual feast but a little pretentious.a bit like this message really.",
         "Greenaway's obsessions with lists, wordplay, coincidence, sexuality, the surreal, and the explicit (not to mention the \"conventionally used\" ones like men and women, birth and eating and death, physiology (formal and psychological), and abstraction) come to a head in this film. A bizarre mileau of fancy digressions and focused narrativity create a film which is perhaps too obtuse for first time viewers but is, as far as I'm concerned, the best way to initiate oneself into the \"world\" of Greenaway.",
         "I cannot recall now who said the following 'proverb', but I do remember that it was: 'Peter Greenaway's films tend to be more admired than enjoyed'\u0097which is primarily true of my experience with 'A Zed & Two Noughts (1985)'. Visually and thematically complex, multi-layered, with references to the fine-arts, it's bound to be relegated into egg-head territory. Yes, it is a very intellectual film but you can't expect anything else from a film director who's reiterated multiple times that we haven't seen 'real cinema' yet, and all we've experienced is '110 years of illustrated text'. Which is, whether you agree or not, true. 'A Zed & Two Noughts', or, simply 'ZOO' (the title itself is a play on words) follows the life of two brothers, Oswald & Oliver Deuce after their respective wives die in a car crash with a swan. Confounded and unable to cope with the grief of losing their wives through this bizarre accident, both brothers initiate an obsessive investigation hoping to find an answer to this inexplicable bereavement. The ensuing investigation includes the filming of decaying animals via time-lapse photography, and the grotesque time-lapse films are played to us like chapter breaks, signifying the evolutionary process itself. First, Oswald Deuce takes a bite off a green apple (like the Biblical Eve) and films its decay\u0097in this case, the Green Apple evokes the Biblical Genesis; after awhile the time-lapse film of the decaying Apple is shown\u0097so begins life(metaphorically); consequently the brothers decide to film the decay of Shrimps (sea creatures came first), then a Fish, a Crocodile followed by a Swan (a nod to the notion of Reptiles evolving into birds), afterwards a Dalmatian dog (Mammal), and finally a Zebra (Primate). Thus, the individual decay sequences are spread throughout the film chronologically (chronologically in the way the particular animal/animals first came into existence). This is just an example of how intricately this film is structured. Aside from nods to Natural History, Darwin etc, we also have references to fine-arts\u0097-specifically in this case, the Dutch Painter Jan Vermeer. Jean-Luc Godard said that Vermeer was the world's 'first cinematographer', with his mastery over the manipulation of light. Indeed, in Greenaway's 'ZOO', there's a character named Van Meegeren (also the name of the famous Vermeer faker) and several scenes replicating the Mise-en-Scene of credited Vermeer paintings such as 'The Music Lesson' or 'The Art Lesson'\u0097credit should of course go to cinematographer SachaVierny as well, who along with Peter Greenaway compiled a list of 26 different ways to light this film, all of which are in exhibit here. 26 is also a running number throughout: with 26 paintings being fully credited to Vermeer, 26 letters in the Roman Alphabet, the letter 'Z' being the 26th letter of the alphabet (the Zebra is the last decomposing animal shown) etc. But, where does this all lead to? It's hard to say, and it's hard to argue against someone who would come to conclusion that this is a film geared towards 'egg-heads'\u0097-indeed it is, but it is not without value for cinephiles: Of course there's the gorgeous, meticulous cinematography, but for a prolonged enjoyment of these visuals an audience participation is required\u0097the more you know about the educated in-references, the better, otherwise it would seem to the casual viewer to be a montage of pretty images. I of course did a lot of research, which helped a lot when re-watching the film. The new Zeitgeist DVD includes a very enlightening, educative commentary by Peter Greenaway which may also help in better understanding 'A Zed & Two Noughts'.",
         "Peter Greenaway is arty. Painfully so. However he readily admits that this film is \"self-conscious\", \"manufactured\" and he says that all cinema is probably as \"artificial\" a form as you can get. This film is beautiful to look at. Greenaway was inspired, visually, by paintings of the mid 17th century, particularly those of Vermeer. Almost every shot is composed like a painting. Many of the shots are symmetrical, walls are filmed flat so that the horizontal lines are parallel with the top and bottom of the frame. Objects are placed on tables as if subjects for a still life. Lighting is used in an alternation of light, shade,light,shade receding to the back of the picture, which is a signature of the type of 17th century, Western art that Greenaway is paying homage to. The substance of the film follows weighty themes, all of which are explained in great detail through the director's commentary: evolution, light and twin-ship. What is lacking is emotion. This is a cerebral film. Your emotional reaction to it will be through the imagery, be it beautiful or repulsive. You will not engage with the characters on an emotional level. You'll find them hard to relate to. The performances are stilted and amateur theatrical. It is fortunate, then, that Michael Nyman provides a fantastic score (present on almost every scene and almost outstaying its welcome) which prevents the dialogue (the script leaves a lot to be desired too) rendering everything flat. Rent this if you enjoy visuals for their own sake, if you wear spectacles and if you like holding your chin in your hand and frowning. I qualify on all those points, so I enjoyed it a great deal. Extra points for an extraordinarily thorough director's commentary on the DVD which serves to pull out all the hidden depths. Though one could make the point that an explanation that adds so much extra understanding leaves you feeling that the film failed adequately to convey much of what was intended. DVD easter eggs (worth seeing): http://www.dvd.net.au/hidden.cgi?movie_id=10484",
         "A rewarding post modern film about life and decay and the effects of a single moment on a person's life. Great sets and photography by the legendary cinematographer Sacha Vierny, this film makes you ultra aware that you are watching a film, or a sort of theatrical filmed piece. Greenaway is an aquired but very rewarding taste, and no other director makes films as he does. A disturbing somber film for serious fans of modern cinema. Greenaway is a must in your education of film.",
         "A Zed and Two Noughts (or Zoo) is Greenaway's best film. Made during the transition between his early experimental short films and his later more narrative (and more celebrated) ones, his free flowing structure is at its best here, fresh, witty and cerebral (some would also say pedantic). In later films, one has the feeling that Greenaway has try to go back to the style set by Zoo, but the results (like in 8 1/2 women) are almost unwatchable. The plot: two biologists twins working in a zoo, specialized in studying the putrefaction of animals, lose their wives in a car accident. They hook up with a strange woman who lost her leg in that accident. Meanwhile, there are references to Vermeer throughout (what does this has to do with zoology, only Greenaway knows), speeded up shots of real rotting animals, Michael Nyman's hypnotic score, and also a girl who learns the alphabet through giant letters that are linked with live animals (for example, z is for zebra, as in a children's book). Deliberately non naturalistic, Greenaway makes from this strange melange a very compelling movie, though undoubtedly very hard to take for some.",
         "All you need to make cinema is a point of view (and of course the view to which it points). Or a frame of reference and the reference which it frames. In Greenaway all these exist together, knowingly, as forms within forms. A story of twins looking to overcome grief by studying the decay of death is the reference here. Zebras, lizards, swans, we see the empty shells of body decay before the camera. Kept under the scrutiny of our gaze in life, inside cages, they remain under it once dead. At what point do all these symmetries which conjoined together make up the miracle of life stop being the sum of their parts, and by which process; how much of these parts that we understand as the self can be taken out before the self is no longer recognized; and the symmetry once broken, what mystery renews it. These obscure ruminations are framed against the question of existence, which implies god and pattern. How come that something so systemised, so perfectly designed and evolved from nothing, from amoeba and algea, can come to pass by the whim of chance? Having taken millions of years for creation to unravel its complexity, why does it take a second to destroy it? Which is to ask, at what point does the system, which in hindsight appears ordained and patterned, become random and meaningless. Various eccentricities are enacted in this process, all pointing to some kind of symbolic nakedness. When the legless woman gives birth to new life, twins again, the old twins, the blueprint for them, must step aside. The film ends with an poignant thought. Having carefully staged their own death so that the decay that follows may be captured on film, we see how nature intrudes upon this scene and foils the effort. An atheist himself, Greenaway here gives us a pessimism that cuts deep; no consciousness survives this.",
         "How does one define oddness? I'd suggest by starting with two words: Peter Greenaway. You can also use those two words to define \"Unique cinema visions,\" \"total control,\" \"beautiful views\" and \"don't mess with me.\" Greenaway is his own world, and you're either eager for a visit or you'll insist on staying off the space ship. I'd suggest you prepare for your visit by packing away any compulsion you might have to explain things...such as his meaning, his importance...all those categories, lists and twos of things...and your own squeamishness. \"I don't make pictures that have a sell-by date,\" Greenaway once said. That's especially true of A Zed and Two Noughts, where a good many of the things we'll see have long passed their sell-by date. We start the movie with a double death in a car crash by a zoo...death by swan on a lane called Swan's Way. The wives of our two zoologists may be gone, but their husbands, twins and formerly joined twins Oswald and Oliver Deuce, will lead us on an exploration of grief and decay, illustrated by their stop motion movies. We will meet a beautiful amputee, soon to have her remaining leg off by a mad surgeon, probably for issues of symmetry. In addition to wet decay, we'll enjoy vomiting, frontal nudity, Vermeer, Greenaway's magnificent color palette, black and white animals, a white mare named Hortense, several interesting fetishes, plus the movie's unique chapter headings: Mercury, Apple, Prawn, Fish, Crocodile, Swan, Dog, Zebra and Escargot. Black comedy, indeed. I'll admit I don't think I understood a thing about A Zed and Two Noughts. I started to read what some critics and fans have offered by way of analysis and found much of what they had to say, from my point of view, largely incomprehensible, too detailed or too dull. Greenaway is chilly, controlling and all about style layered heavily on top of substance. He can make Stanley Kubrick look loosey-goosey. I found a Zed and Two Noughts, in a perverse kind of way, enjoyable. I suspect that's because Greenaway comes up with such odd, intriguing and often disturbing visions. They can almost make you forget what the devil he's getting at. For me, Prospero's Books is a perfect blend of style and story; The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover is an almost perfect match of style and story; The Draughtsman's Contract is an amusing overlay of manners, murder, style and story. But A Zed and Two Noughts? Well, I found it chilly, sometimes uninvolving and often amusing. I enjoyed it, more or less, most of the time. (I occasionally used the fast-forward button). If ten people can tell me what the movie means, beyond the old standbys of death, grief and snails, I'll bet I'll read ten wildly different opinions. That's no particular criticism of either Greenaway or the film."
