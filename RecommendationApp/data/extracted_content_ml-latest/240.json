         "Call me the ultimate anarch, but I'm inclined to disagree with the slatings this movie has received. Maybe I was watching a different film, but I pretty much enjoyed Hideaway. Okay, maybe the scripting wasn't pure Shakespeare, maybe the plot was a little tenuous, or a little unoriginal, but still, a little credit where it's due please. I admit, I was expecting from the write-up a second rate TV movie, but ended up with a deranged grin plastered across my face. I particularly enjoyed the film's 'darkness', and hellishly black soundtrack that only added to the effect. Personally, I'm surprised that Jeremy Sisto has yet to be mentioned in the reviews, because I believe his chilling performance as Vasago was one of the shining factors in this movie. What with his penetrating stare and spooky, well-spoken accent he made, to me, the perfect killer. A round of applause for the young man, if you please. Personally, I see Hideaway as a movie that should be a big hit with the gothic community, and I shall stand by my word regardless...",
         "Seriously...why can't they make one of Dean Koontz's book into a DECENT movie? I mean they dont even get the characters right...Regina (Silverstone) is supposed to be a nine year old \"crippled\" (as she defines herself in the book). Changing her character takes away from the plot of the story! It's a shame that they waste Koontz's amazing talent on movie's like these.",
         "I haven't read Dean Koontz's novel, but most of this movie's faults can be traced back to predictable and simplistic script, which bears a strong resemblance to \"The Eyes Of Laura Mars\". Otherwise, this is an entertaining horror thriller, with trippy \"tunnel vision\" (literally) sequences, flashes of dark humor and the usual good performance by Jeff Goldblum. The \"good vs. evil\" climax does come off a bit cheesy, but that doesn't happen because the effects are not good; it happens because of the way in which they are employed. (**1/2)",
         "I've seen earlier Brett Leonard's horror film \"The Dead Pit\"(1989-check out my comment of it!)and this director is incredibly overlooked and talented.\"Hideawy\" is excellent-fast-paced,violent and really dark.The visuals(especially the vision of Hell)are really impressive,and Jeremy Sisto as a satanic killer Vassago is outstanding-he is pure evil!Great soundtrack bu such industrial/metal bands like KMFDM,Fear Factory,Godflesh(\"Nihil\"-I love this song!)and Front Line Assembly.My absolute recommendation.",
         "While traveling on the road with his wife Lindsay (Christine Lahti) and his daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone), Hatch Harrison (Jeff Goldblum) has a car accident, hitting a truck and falling with his wife in a river. He dies for more than two hours, but the specialist Dr. Jonas Nyebern (Alfred Molina) successfully brings him back to life. Hatch has some weird premonitions and becomes able to see through the eyes of the psychopath serial killer Vassago (Jeremy Sisto), a young man that killed his mother and his sister and committed suicide and was also brought back to life and now is killing young women and teenagers. When he foresees that Vassago is trying to capture his daughter, Hatch tries to find the criminal first, in spite of Lindsay, Regina and the detective in charge of the investigation believe that he needs psychiatric help. \"Hideaway\" is another rip-off of \"Eye of Laura Mars\", I believe the first movie to explore the idea of a person connected to a serial killer through his eyes. \"Hideaway\" has a good cinematography and special affects, the cast is great and the sequence of the accident of Hatch and Lindsay is excellent. Although not being an original storyline, this attractive movie entertains. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): \"O Esconderijo\" (\"The Hiding Place\")",
         "Hideaway grabs your attention from the start with Hatch Harrison going to the spiritual world filled with spectacular, illuminating effects. Then seeing through the eyes of a killer who is after teenage women and having Alicia Silverstone (Regina)as your daughter you know that he will meet with the killer sooner than he ever hoped. With the plot having more twists and turns than first meets the eye makes this easily the best thriller I've seen. With the killer being perfectly cast with his black sunnies and trenchcoat, I even love the music which provides an eerie atmosphere for the movie. This movie has made me a big fan of Dean Koontz's novels.",
         "Dean Koontz chiller, starring Jeff Goldblum. Highly entertaining...suspenseful... even mesmerizing at times. Jeff Goldblum pulls the veritable rabbit out of the proverbial hat in this one. His acting is intensely deep and highly professional in this Brett Leonard (director of the notoriously horrible adaptation of Stephen King's \"Lawnmower Man,\" so bad it was, King SUED and WON, to have his name removed from the title and marketing!) adaptation of Dean Koontz's literary effort. This adaptation is horrid, as well. Koontz, in my opinion, should also have sued. The \"adaptation\" isn't an adaptation, it's a complete rewriting of the story, dialog, setting and characters. The only thing that remains the same is Hatch (Goldblum) and the circumstances which surround his amazing new \"gift.\" Koontz's earlier works, as was the work upon which this movie was based, had little detail, although his characters are very well developed and his story lines/plots move along with little or no distraction at all. This leaves his earlier works easily adapted to film by any director with a capable imagination and even just a little talent. Unfortunately, Brett Leonard displays neither in this attempt. Someone should have told him the red sun ... wasn't SCARY! As a movie, it is highly entertaining, fun, scary and has you literally on the edge of your seat several times during its viewing. There are a couple of really well done \"scare you!\" moments and many moments where you catch yourself holding your breath. However good the movie itself may be (or may not, depending on your point of view), Jeff Goldblum's performance completely redeems the horrid rewrite and inept direction of this production. Totally. The scenery and props were very well done, and the scene in which Hatch visits the Tarot Reader is very authentic. The tarot cards she uses are quite unique and extremely well designed. I wouldn't mind having a deck like that myself. The Alpine-styled architectures and wooden and glass designs are truly lovely and well designed. Even the slightest attention to scene settings and props make for a much more enjoyable finished product. Christine Lahti is very convincing as Hatch's (Goldblum's) wife, Lindsey Harrison, and Alicia Silverstone is believable and fun to watch, in her portrayal of the Harrison's younger daughter. I'm not a fan of Ms. Silverstone's, but I must say her performance in this role is about the best I've ever seen from her. The twists and turns in this movie are a bit predictable, but there are a few surprises which leave you saying, \"Wow...\"...but what saved this production was Jeff Goldblum's marvelous talent. Jeremy Sisto was a nice bit of eye candy for those who are interested in that, but it was Goldblum's wonderful gift for acting that put this movie in my horror collection. It was a good book, and is a good movie; it's just not enough like the book for me to feel comfortable with the adaptation, and the direction was completely lacking. However, the actors weren't walking around aimlessly, spouting drivel and worthless platitudes thanks to Walker's (he did BRAINSCAN!!!!) abilities, but his screen play/adaptation should really have been more faithful to Koontz's wonderful story. It would have made for a much more entertaining evening...and movie. The ending is very satisfying; high tension, wonderful techno music playing not too loud, but loud enough in the background, and Hatch's wife saying over and over, \"I'm so sorry,\" for doubting Hatch's visions were real. His gift takes him straight to his daughter's side...and into the clutches of the \"demon\" with which he has been granted psychic contact. Who will win the ultimate battle? Hatch (the good guy), Vassago/Jeremy (the \"demon\") or another, unrevealed participant? While the final battle takes place on this plane, the ethereal battle which rages in the background is every bit as important. This climaxial scene is the epitome of metaphorical synergy. It was the only scene in the movie which was well-directed; where the acting quality, the visual effects and the direction were in sync with one another. Before this scene, for the entire rest of the movie, the acting quality is the only thing which will keep you watching it. All in all, it earns a 7.0/10 from... the Fiend :.",
         "This film is by far, one of my favorite films. I will admit that the very end of the movie was a tad cheesy, but not so much that the film was ruined. I left the movie feeling very fortunate to have been able to watch it again. I saw this movie about four years ago and loved it, and watched it again. It did have some scenes that I preferred to watch through half-closed fingers, but for the most part, it was truly a wonderful film. As it is, it is a very underground movie, and in the years to come, it will become even more so. I recommend this movie to anyone who has a strong stomach and has an open mind.",
         "Don't forget to watch the final scene. If you are patient enough, wait until the credits are over and you will be rewarded with one final scene. I won't tell you anything about it, you have to see it for yourself. Like this one, there are many films that have inserted one extra piece of the story. Some times you have to expect the unexpected, a twist in the plot right in the final scene. Why directors include such easter eggs? Maybe they expect that a film-goer like you should see the entire movie, his whole piece of art. So, run to your video store o videoteque and place the VHS or DVD in your player and enjoy. Remember: the story is not over till it's over.",
         "Hidaway tells the tale of the Harrison family, husband & wife Hatch (Jeff Goldblum) & Lindsey (Christine Lahti) plus their teenage daughter Regina (Alicia Silverstone). Driving back from a weekend away they are involved in a car accident which kills Hatch but after being technically dead for 1 hour & 20 minutes Dr. Jonas Nyebern (Alfred Molina) manages to bring him back to life using a new form of resuscitation developed by himself. At first the Harrison family believe they have been given a second change & are overjoyed but one night Hatch as a disturbing vision while cutting himself, that of a young missing girl named Wendy Stone (Gaetana Korbin) being brutally murdered. The visions continue as Hatch begins to think that he may have a psychic link with a serial killer named Vassago (Jeremy Sisto) but at the same time Vassago has a link with him & decides he'll pay Hatch's family a nice friendly visit... Directed by Brett Leonard I thought Hideaway was a decent enough horror/thriller but in the end nothing spectacular. The script by Andrew Kevin Walker & Neal Jimenez was based on the novel by Dean R. Koontz who was prepared to sue to get his name off the opening credits he thought it so crap, well I probably wouldn't want to put my name to it but that seems a little extreme. Anyway Hideaway moves along at a reasonable pace although it could have used 10 or so minutes cut out, it takes Goldblum ages to realise what's going on while we, the audience, know almost straight away so we sit there waiting for him to catch up. I was also disappointed in the weak climax, a lacklustre good vs. evil showdown with Goldblum's family in danger, seen it all before. On a positive note I thought the film was entertaining for what it was, there's an average twist at the end which isn't brilliant but is better than nothing I suppose & it maintained my interest in where it was going. Director Leonard doesn't do much to impress, Hideaway is a well made but has little in the way of scares or tension. The best scenes involve Vassago dressed in shades & long black coat, he's has a strong on screen presence. The gore is OK but not exactly plentiful, someone impales themselves on a knife, someone's eye is poked out, there are a couple of slit throats & Goldblum clenches a razor which sends blood squirting everywhere. With an extremely healthy sounding $15,000,000 budget I simply can't see where all that money went, I really can't. Sure you have to pay stars Goldblum & Silverstone but apart from that there's no big action scenes, limited special effects, no exotic locations & the thing looks like a TV film on occasion. Certainly not worth fifteen big ones. The acting is pretty good & Goldblum is always good to watch although I thought Lahti as his wife was awful. Hideaway is a decent way to pass the time, it's not the best film ever but it's not the worst. I liked it but I could see why someone wouldn't, hard to give a glowing recommendation to but I think it's worth a watch."
