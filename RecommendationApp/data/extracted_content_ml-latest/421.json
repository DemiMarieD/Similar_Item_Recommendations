         "Black Beauty is, (at least in my opinion,) one of the most underrated films of all time. It seems to be widely ignored, for the reason that it doesn't seem to be targeted at any specific age group or audience. For the people that pass it by because it seems boring, or another childrens book adaptation, try it, it really is a wonderful picture. Anyone who likes animals, period pieces, or stories of courage and love would especially like it. The costumes, carriages and scenery are beautiful. And the horses! This movie is a horsepersons dream. The scenes featuring the horses were breathtaking...colts racing over green grass, a filly and pony trotting together, their sinewy legs moving together in smooth rhythm, an elegant black stallion rearing up; they were all absolutely beautiful. My favorite scene was the scene in which Beauty is being broken -(being taught to carry a rider). The wonderful line - \"But once I discovered that he and I, that the two of us could become one, this business turned out to be perfectly glorious!\" - the music swells, and the horse takes off, racing across the green, and everything else turns to a blur. (I get goosebumps thinking about it!)Kudos to the voice of Black Beauty - I don't know who it is, but he really made the picture. (And the horse, too - he was wonderful, a gentleman.) All in all, a beautiful, moving picture that no family should be without a copy of.(Some parts are sad.) Seven out of ten stars.",
         "For the horse lover, Black Beauty is a tragic tale in which the sensual beauty of horses is artfully depicted. It will pull at your heart strings, make you smile from ear to ear, cry honestly, and desperately want to take a trip to the barn. For the music lover, Black Beauty is an emotional ride in which the music all too well toys with the human soul. The music is so delicately composed, performed, and chosen for the movie that it is worth seeing just to enjoy the soundtrack. For the critic, Black Beauty is an endearing story laden with green actors and a plot directed toward the youth. The green actors allow the film to be honest and emotional, however. And the youthful plot allow the earnestness and sensuality to create an even greater effect upon audiences of all ages. For the average viewer, Black Beauty is a film worth watching. It is a film that will make an impression. It will not go down in the Hollywood hall of fame, nor will it be recollected by high and mighty of movie making. It will, however, stand the test of time as a film loved and cherished by the few who have seen and loved it.",
         "Black Beauty is true to Anna Sewell's wonderful book, and the beautiful scenery and music enhance the story of Black Beauty's adventures with his friends. We laughed and cried in the same places during the movie as we did when reading the book. Thank you to all responsible for creating this movie and making one of our favorite stories come to life before our eyes!",
         "This film is brilliantly made and enjoyable for anyone of any age.For horse lovers like me it is a wonderful film, I've seen it several times and even though I know the story well, it still never fails to move me to tears. Even my husband watched this film with me and the children and said that it was good and that he enjoyed it, so it can't be bad!! The music is incredibly moving as is the story and the acting is also very good. Their are several bits in the film that will amuse even young children and even my son who is not yet two enjoys watching Black Beauty running with his friends Ginger and Merry-legs.The bottom line is if you love animals at all, especially horses, then you will completely adore this film.",
         "This film is truly excellent. Not only does it feature superb location and music, but it is also an unforgettable story. You soon learn to look past the idea of \"animals can't talk\" and see how wonderful it really is, and you don't need to be young to enjoy. So powerful, it will bring you to tears.",
         "I'm just a toasted marshmallow when it comes to this story. I've read the book many times and CRY every time. This movie and the earlier productions of it have the same effect on me. Needless to say, the book is ultimately superior to any of the movie versions but this movie does do justice to the book. A movie about life from the animal's point of view will conjure visions of 'Mr. Ed' or 'Francis, The Talking Mule' in a few unimaginative folks but this story really puts the idea of 'walking in another's shoes' in perspective. The novel and the movies helped me develop respect and empathy for all creatures at a very early age. See this movie with someone you love. You won't be sorry.",
         "Beautiful movie, beautiful music, beautiful scenes, beautiful horses! This movie let us people see the life of a horse through his eyes. Now you can better understand what's it like to be a horse, although, this horse can 'talk' and has emotions like we have. But that doesn't make it less sad. Unfortunately, even today, lots of horses have a life like Black Beauty. Even much worse... The story is about the life of Black Beauty. A Quarter horse. During his life he meets a boy, Joe, and becomes attached to him. After Black Beauty is being sold (according to him, every horse knows this terrifying word) he meets the horses Ginger and Merrylegs. After being sold again Black Beauty's life becomes more and more a misery: waiting and hoping to see Joe and Ginger again. The best, and true, line from the movie: \"We don't get to choose the people in our lives, for us it's all chance\" -Black Beauty-",
         "Black Beauty the film has done an excellent job at being as captivating as the book. The acting is superb and i love the amazing job done at making the viewers have a look at the past. It is a very well-done film, and not for the weak at heart. It gives wonderful insight to the rough life of a horse, and his travels. The end is truly heartfelt.",
         "Though this is reviewed many years hence it is one of the time honored testaments of this media even some ten plus years having past,that this tribute was never the more beautiful then even now some ten years plus since then.This contribution comes at the expense of ones heart as you grow in the knowledge of the possibility of a dream.Reality provides the greatest test of ones courage under fire,though \"Black Beauty\" is billed as a child's film,this adult had a very hard time not caring a great deal about the wonderous even glorious relation we share with the animal kingdom and nature.The film seems to be beautifully constructed perhaps deliberately with many areas of the film working very well.It is a beautifully photographed film where these magnificent creatures are showcased and nature is highlighted.There is in the telling of this story a narrator whose ability to place intelligence in the very heart of these magnificent beasts is heart warming and engaging,truly this story skirts the issue of inspiration,it is that beautifully told.Historically soundtracks are there for a reason,this soundtrack almost steals the show,it is such a testament to the creative abilities of Daniel Elfman.It is literally a great piece of musical composition and motion picture scoring.If the reader wishes to know first hand listen closely from the very start and the human heart will be tested as to its ability to break.So loving and eloquent is this musical interlude that rarely is this mark been attained,it is beautiful.I watched this film 4 times in less than 24 hours and each time one of the reasons why I watched again and again was the lovely even emotional interplay between the film and the music.However last but not least though only for children it may very well be,it was very hard to take when the suffering ensues and the majestic Black Beauty and Ginger struggle to survive.Truly it is a lovely sentimental story deeply held and faithfully portrayed.The belief in a better world or in the dream of another world is even now a thoughtful and abiding conviction in the love we share when we share that love with each other.This is more than a children's story but a lessen in caring and it may actually surprise you to know that we must care for the wild as we have the privilege of dominion over the wild.We must never abuse that privilege and always care as a caretaker cares,such is the testament to this graceful telling of the life of Black Beauty.Highly recommended for both children and adults alike.",
         "When a horse is born it never knew its life would become a whirl-wind of emotions. Where's hes sent to Birtwick hall, he meets Joe. A young boy who has no idea in horses, but has a big heart. When his family have to move away, to a warmer place Black Beauty is sent a posh, snub-nose family. They treat him badly and in the end he is sold to another family. A little worse for wear he's finally bought by jerry, Another family, another name. Hes named black jack and is used as to pull carriages. When Jerry becomes sick, its off to another home for Black Beauty. This time its to pull heavy sack loads of flour and grain. After years of pulling the heavy carts he gives up, and is sent to a sell. After nearly two decades of moving to and from Families, he finally finds Joe. And in thoses tearful words \"Im here Beauty, I'm here\" This film makes me cry, even after 4-5 times of watching it. Every time you watch it, tears fill your eyes. Its a wonderful touching story, thank you Anne Sewell for writing the stunning book, and Caroline Thompson for Making it into the film we all know and love."
