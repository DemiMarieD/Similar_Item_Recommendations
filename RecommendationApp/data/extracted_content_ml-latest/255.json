         "This movie could have been a lot funnier if only they didn't use almost the exact same dialogue from their prank calls. Seriously some of the scenes from the movie are almost word-for-word with the calls. If you haven't heard their \"jerky-isms\" (rubberbeck, sizzle-chest) then this might be funny to you. Anyway the movie is about two \"low-lifes from Queens\", two late-20's guys who can't get a job who still live at home. They end up calling a random number which just happens to be a local mob boss. Johnny Brennan does his hilarious Frank Rizzo voice claiming to be childhood friends with the guy who becomes infuriated after being called \"fruity-a$$\". (the only really funny scene.) Once they meet the boys in person, an arrogant local boy Brett Weir sees them at the same restaurant and clues the mafia in as to who the Jerky Boys really are. So the rest of the movie is basically them trying to outrun the mob. Some scenes following were okay, with a cameo by Ozzy Ozbourne and the NY hardcore band Helmet. In the end when the gang kidnaps Johnny's mom and fits her for a pair of cement shoes, Johnny and Kamal call the newspapers up to expose the mob. The end. A lot of people said the plot was clichéd. Not really, I thought it worked good, it just wasn't EXECUTED properly. And by properly, I mean humorously. The first time I heard the call about the old man with the Mexican immigrant worker it was funny. \"I kicked him in his little hiney\" The second time it seemed rushed, like they had to create a scene where the actions would fit perfectly with the call. This one happens to be made over a call box on a warehouse where the bad guys are standing near, to distract them while the boys escape. Some of the actors, who have played distinguished, critically-acclaimed roles in other movies (Alan Arkin, Vincent Pastore, William Hickey) seem like they're having a REAL hard time saying their lines. They must have needed money. I won't tell you not to see it, because as far as i know it has not been released on DVD. And I can guarantee you can find it for a buck or two at almost ANY movie store. So if you have or haven't heard the prank call albums but you still want to see it, you'll only be a few bucks short if you don't like it.",
         "Johnny Brennan and Kamal play themselves as a pair of prank callers who find themselves crossing wires with the mob. This is not one of the greatest films of 1995, but not very bad. More than half the pranks are based on their popular albums. If you're a true fan of \"The Jerky Boys,\" you might enjoy this film. Personally, I like the albums better. Later, tough guy! My evaluation: ** out of ****.",
         "This was bottom of the barrel cinema when it came out. Its not anything you should really have high expectations for when you start into it. That being said, compared to the bottom of the comedy barrel these days this movie is a worthwhile and entertaining entry. The supporting cast actually isn't too bad. Other reviewers have questioned the appearance of Alan Arkin in this film, and maybe it is weird, but whatever he's in it. So is Vincent Pastore (\"Big Pussy\" Bonpensiero from \"The Sopranos\") and cameos from Tom Jones and Ozzy Osbourne (a particularly rare depiction of him when he still had some vital essence left and decked out in appropriate mid-90's high fashion.) Speaking of the the mid-90's, there's a lot of great footage of New York City in the years right before Giulianni started cleaning the place up. Anyways, the movie is funny. Its not the funniest movie ever, but the ad hominem attacks, creative profanity, and silly voices will make you laugh. Its nice to see their skits made into live action, even though the real genius of their humor on their tapes was that the calls were real and the calls in the movie are scripted. Its a solid B-grade comedy. If you're expecting more, you have the wrong idea.",
         "I enjoy a good comedy, but it must have a good plot. Dumb and Dumber and Road Trip are my two other favorite comedies. This film is not only damn hilarious, but it provides an awesome story. The mob elements arent cheesy either, they are actually pretty good.",
         "Yeah, this is a moronic movie. For those who haven't heard the boys' prank calls (which I find funny, and even sometimes clever), their jokes will fall pretty flat. They just don't work on-screen. And for those of us who HAVE heard their old stuff, the movie serves as a rehash and seems \"old hat.\" The only reason I rented this was to get a look at the faces behind the voices--doesn't Johnny B. look like a chubby Sean Astin with a mullet-like hairdo? Stick to their audio-only work.",
         "Man, at the time this movie came out I had already been a fan of the \"Boys\" for several years. To me these guys will always be the Kings of the prank call. I was literally in tears when I first heard the albums; so when I heard about a movie coming out I was psyched! I learned the movie was going to be a PG-13 and I was a little disappointed because the \"Boys\" are known for vulgarity. Upon seeing the movie I was entertained, it certainly had its funny moments. I believe you have to go in having an open mind. It is a movie with a plot, so their normal comedy of getting unsuspecting people is not there. I think they do a good job at comedy and the movie overall is funny, I think a lot of people expected their normal stuff but this was an attempt to broadening their audience and take them into the real\"mainstream.\" If your a die-hard Jerky fan, I think you will enjoy it and if you like comedies I believe you will enjoy it. If your expecting for it to be just like the tapes then you will be disappointed. Aside from a couple of my favorite characters missing I enjoyed it, laughed, and will watch again.",
         "The Jerky Boys are a famous comedy duo known for making prank calls which have been recorded and released on albums. I knew about them by the time I first came across a copy of this film for rent at a video store recently, but didn't know they had their own movie until then. Released in 1995, long before I was old enough to watch R-rated movies, \"The Jerky Boys\" is a comedy starring the two prank callers, John G. Brennan and Kamal Ahmed. By the time I watched this, I had heard many of their recorded prank calls (it seems they were falsely credited for several of the ones I heard, but most of them really were from the duo), and thought they were generally funny, but since I was aware of this film's lack of popularity, I wasn't surprised by its overall mediocrity. Johnny B. and Kamal are two \"lowlifes from Queens\" who have been making prank telephone calls since they were kids. John's mother warned the two of them what they would be like when they grew up if they didn't change their ways, and sure enough, they have since grown up and turned out to be exactly what she predicted, two unemployed idiots still living at home. Making prank calls is still a major hobby of theirs, and they've had certain jobs in the past, but due to their stupidity and incompetence, they didn't have them for long. Unfortunately for Johnny and Kamal, their prank calling gets them into serious trouble when they call the local mafia and Johnny pretends to be a crime boss from Chicago named Frank Rizzo, and the two of them then pose as two of Rizzo's hoodlums when they go to meet members of the Queens mob in person! They soon find that not only are the local mafia after them, so are the police! Shortly after I began to watch this 1995 flop, I did find myself laughing or at least smiling at times, but not enough to make me think it was a actually a good comedy, and I didn't care for the part with Johnny and Kamal (as kids) watching a boy getting in trouble with his mother after they prank called her, and what the mother says she'll do to her son when they get inside. None of the gags in this movie are among the most revolting I've ever seen, but one fairly lame scene is the one with hot dogs made from human bodies! Most of the film is basically just mediocre, unfunny, and boring. The plot also isn't that interesting, with the two pranksters getting into more and more trouble. I certainly did laugh at times, such as the drive-thru scene and the part where the main characters (the Jerky Boys playing themselves) steal a cab and Kamal poses as the cab driver. These laughs definitely weren't always just small ones, either. Still, for the vast majority of the film, I kept a straight face, and cannot give it a high rating. This silly comedy was apparently panned by critics and seems to be fairly obscure, but it seems that some Jerky Boys fans like it. However, it also appears many of those who have seen it think it's atrocious, and I'm sure a number of the duo's fans have been disappointed by this movie of theirs. As someone who has never listened to any of their albums from start to finish but has heard enough of their recorded pranks individually to be convinced that they know how to be funny, I sure would have been disappointed if I had expected this film to be as good. Apart from occasional funny moments (some very funny and some mildly amusing) and a cameo appearance from Ozzy Osbourne as the Band Manager, there was hardly anything in 1995's \"The Jerky Boys\" (a.k.a. \"The Jerky Boys: The Movie\") that appealed to me. If you're not a Jerky Boys fan at all, I suggest you skip this film, and if you are a fan, I can't imagine how you could watch this without finding anything in it funny at all (though you never know), but don't be surprised if you find that it doesn't live up to the duo's audio recordings.",
         "I am a huge fan of these two. I know the majority of people hate these guy's, but I think they are brilliant. This movie was widely panned over by critics and movie goers, but it is just another great example of the genius that is the Jerky Boys. You have to know their prank phone call background to fully appreciate all the jokes in this movie. And to listen to their prank call CD's, you start to see how quick witted these two are, to come up with the calls they do is pure genius. Listen to the CD's and then watch this movie, you will laugh your butt off, I can almost guarantee it ! Just watch the 'drive through' scene in this movie to see one of the funniest bits on film ever !",
         "To be fair the title itself doesn't really get this film off to the best of starts and i was not really impressed by the DVD case or anything about it, however never judge a book by its cover, as i came to find out. The jerky boys main strength lies in the quality of 'Gangster accents'' portrayed by the lead characters. The whole idea of two 30 year old men sitting round making obscene and very funny phone calls all day would in principle sound like an unattractive watch. In saying this though the jerky boys has some hilarious moments which left me and my father in fits of laughter, (no exaggeration),. IN terms of a plot the jerky boys doesn't come off so well which is why all included i feel it overall deserves a 6. To conclude if your looking for a quick laugh, nothing special or something funny to watch with friends I highly recommend the jerky boys.",
         "I loved this movie and busted a gut laughing at the first 10 minutes. Basically, the first ten minutes of the movie is by far the peak of the film but there's still some laughs in between. I haven't seen this movie all the way through in at least 3 or 4 years and I would love to see it again. I just remember loaning my video of this to my Aunt and she never returned it because she loved it more than I did. The scene at the burger joint is hilarious and the one at the construction site is also one of the funnier parts of the movie. I hope they bring this movie to DVD one day. It's nearly impossible to find in video stores and it rarely ever comes on TV. It would be a great addition to my DVD collection next to 'Freddy Got Fingered'. 10/10"
