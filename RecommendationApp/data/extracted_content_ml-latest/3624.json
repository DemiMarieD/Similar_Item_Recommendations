      "synopsis": "Chon Wang is a Chinese imperial guard. After Princess Pei-Pei, for whom Wang has affection, is abducted and taken to the United States, the Emperor of China sends three of his guards to retrieve her. Wang is not among one of the three, but after he tells them that it was his fault the princess was kidnapped, he is merely sent in the hopes that the \"foreign devils\" would get rid of Wang. In Nevada, Roy O'Bannon is an outlaw who, with his gang, hijacks the train Wang is on. When Wallace, a member of Roy's gang, kills Wang's uncle, Wang chases the outlaws down. However, the gang is well-armed and Wang's only choice is to unhinge the cars and get away on the engine. In the process, Wallace takes over the gang from Roy, and they leave him buried up to his chin in the desert sand. Meanwhile, Pei-Pei, who was tricked into believing she was freely escaping her arranged marriage in China, finds out she has been kidnapped by an agent of Lo Fong, who ran away from the Forbidden City and was viewed as a traitor by the Chinese. When Wang finds Roy buried in the sand, he demands to know the direction to Carson City. Roy tells him that the city is on the other side of a mountain. Wang puts two chop sticks in Roy's mouth for him to dig himself out. When Wang comes out the other side of the mountain, he gets involved with a Sioux tribe by saving a boy chased by the Crow tribe and ends up reluctantly marrying the tribe chief's daughter, Falling Leaves. Wang finds Roy in a tavern and, in anger, starts a fight with him that turns into a barroom brawl. The two of them get sent to prison, and after Falling Leaves helps them escape, they become friends. Roy trains Wang in the ways of the cowboy. When they get to Carson City, Roy discovers that both he and Wang, now identified as the \"Shanghai Kid\" are wanted by Lo Fong's ally Marshal Nathan Van Cleef, and the two of them narrowly escape. They go to a bordello (which Roy describes as his \"hideout\"), but after a drunken encounter by Wang, the Marshal eventually catches and arrests them. They find out that Lo Fong is behind the kidnapping of the princess. As they are about to be hanged, Wang manages to break himself free and after Falling Leaves shoots Roy loose, they escape the execution site. Wang, upset over Roy previously telling one of the prostitutes at the bordello he was not Wang's friend, rides off alone to find the Princess. However, Roy follows him and the two reunite when Roy saves him from Fong. The next day, the two partners go to the ransom point, the Carson City Mission church. The three imperial guards arrive with the gold, and Lo Fong has the princess in hand. However, a simple exchange becomes complicated when Wang shows up and Roy points a gun towards Fong. Wang tells his fellow guards that he will not allow them to bring the princess back to China. As the Chinese and Lo Fong fight amongst themselves, Van Cleef arrives and engages Roy in a gunfight. After Roy is limited to one remaining bullet, Van Cleef simultaneous fires both of his guns but Roy shoots him in the heart. Wang fights the Imperial Guards whilst Lo Fong chases Pei-Pei through the rafters of the church. After Wang knocks all three Guards unconscious he fights Lo Fong to the bell tower. Wang ultimately kills Lo Fong by dismantling the bell causing it to hang Lo Fong. When they awaken, the Imperial Guards decide that they will let the princess stay. Wallace and his gang also come up to the church, and demand that Roy and Wang come out and fight. But when the two of them get outside the church to face Wallace, Natives from all around surround the gang. At a Chinese cultural celebration Roy thanks Falling Leaves for saving him and they engage in a passionate kiss. At the same time, Pei-Pei holds a smiling Wang's hand. Roy and Wang are shown as sheriffs and ride off to catch a new band of train robbers.",

         "Great fun! Jackie Chan brings his brand of physical comedy to Hollywood with another buddy movie. Similar to his \"Rush Hour\" series with Chris Tucker, Chan sets this one in the American old west and chooses Owen Wilson as his partner. I like these better than the Rush Hours. Tucker and Owen are both excellent playing opposite Chan in both series, but the Shanghai series seems to offer Jackie better venues for his elaborate fight sequences. Saloons, brothels and even wilderness settings are used with great success. And make no mistake, the fight sequences are what make (or break) a Jackie Chan movie. \"Fight sequence\" of course means something different in a Chan movie as opposed to normal action fare. Rather than true violence, Jackie's fight scenes are more Vaudeville than \"Pulp Fiction\". More Chaplin than Jet Li. Each fight is painstakingly choreographed to interact with the set surrounding it. Tables, chairs, vases, antlers, shrubbery... the list goes on. A successful Jackie Chan movie seems to contain a comedy-oriented story, a lightly delivered moral message, and lots of action. Shanghai Noon certainly delivers here. I spent the entire movie either chuckling to myself or laughing out loud, and had a very satisfied smile when the credits rolled. Highly recommended. 7 out of 10.",
         "It seems this film has been out longer than just six years but I remember it was one of the first modern-day humorous martial arts films to be seen in North America. It also introduced a much wider English- speaking audience to the charm and talents of Asian star Jackie Chan, who now is well-known everywhere, even if he is getting up in age. This is considered one of Chan's better films and the setting certainly is different than normal for him: the American Old West. Good action scenes, some solid humor, fun characters and nice cinematography are all the pluses. Chan speaks English so there is no need for dubbing, either. The only \"minus\" I found was the final action scene going on too long, but that's typical of films. All in all, this is a very entertaining movie. Owen Wlson and Lucy Liu also are two big reasons this film became so popular.",
         "Final Score: 8.9 (out of 10) Of all of the `east-meets-west' scenarios Hollywood has concocted to showcase the talents of international action star Jackie Chan, Shanghai Noon turns out to be the most fun and surprisingly fresh yet. His American partner this time is one blonde haired Owen Wilson in his first big lead role. Chan and Wilson have more chemistry and are more fun to watch then Chan and 'Rush Hour' co-star Chris Tucker ever were. Not to mention the high concept setting that successfully mixes the buddy comedy, a Hong Kong martial arts movie and an old American western (the deadest of generas). It is the 18th century. Chan is imperial guard Chon Wang who winds up alone in the old west searching for the Chinese royal family's kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu, thankfully with little screen time). Wilson is, and I remember it so well because it just sounds like a typical cowboy name, Roy O'Bannon - a hapless, 2-bit train robber with an even more incompetent team behind him. Wilson gets huge laughs with his motor mouth and that constantly befuddled look on his face. He looks like he'd rather be surfing. It isn't long before a series of events throws them together and send each into a little bout with culture shock. In typical buddy movie style they are at each others throats one minute and in a tub bonding over drinking games the next. There may be a cliché here and there but watching these two bounce off each other is so exuberant and entertaining it's hardly noticeable. 'Shanghai Noon' is helmed by first-time director Tom Dey who makes a remarkable debut. Dey lobs the gags at us, well timed and many times from the periphery of our vision (something noticeably lost when the movie is seen in a pan-and-scan version). O'Bannon's first stage coach robbery and a scene with a drunken Jackie Chan and his drunken horse are absolute riots. The movie also has put equal time into the action department. There are a lot of great fights and action set pieces in here allowing Chan to show off his magic. He makes use of ropes, trees, antlers and all sorts of props when improvising in some terrific - and even exciting - fight scenes. The cocktail premise of 'Shanghai Noon' is so original that it is only in those patented Chan moments where we are brought back into being aware that this is `a Jackie Chan vehicle'. At nearly 2 solid hours the movie threatens to drag, but have no fear. It has enough wit and creativity up it's sleeve to grab our interest and not let go. Many recent action movies are long for the sake of it, but Noon makes ample use of it's time to give us a fully realized and satisfying comedic adventure. And with Dey and two comic pros like Chan and Wilson driving the antics, Shanghai Noon is a hoot and a half.",
         "Pairing Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson together may seem the most unlikely thing to do since color televisions were first invented. But both of these actors are funny, in one way or another--Chan through his innocence, Wilson through his sarcastic, snide remarks. Wilson is as impressive an actor as he is a writer--he shares writing credits on such films as \"Rushmore\" and \"The Royal Tenenbaums.\" Chan, on the other hand, is a better martial arts master than Jet Li and a more likable character actor than Chow Yun Fat (whose disastrous film \"Bulletproof Monk\" made me want to split his head open to prevent him from ever making another American mainstream motion picture ever again). In \"Shanghai Noon,\" Chan plays Chon Wang, a 19th century Chinese martial arts master who ventures out to Nevada in order to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), whose name is misused by Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) on at last one occasion. After Chon Wang (mistakenly pronounced \"John Wayne\") meets up with Roy, the two decide to form an alliance and rescue the princess -- one for honor, the other for loads of money awaiting them upon her safe arrival back home in Imperial China's Forbidden City. Roy is a lousy wannabe cowboy who used to stage clumsy train robberies along with his band of thieves, who betrayed him and left him for dead. He offers his help to Wang, and tries to play it cool, but he can't -- after all, he's not a very convincing cowboy. But, as the smarmy wisecracking sidekicks always are, O'Bannon just wants money. But as his friendship with Chan grows stronger, he realizes that money isn't everything. Sounds routine, doesn't it? Well, it is, to a certain extent. But it succeeds due to a fine cast -- Chan and Wilson are extraordinarily good together; so good, in fact, that Chris Tucker is just a forgotten memory by the time that the film is over. It's a classic spin on the Old West formula; what \"The Princess Bride\" or \"Shrek\" did for fairy tales, \"Shanghai Noon\" does for Westerns. All the old cliches are poked fun at in a light way. And as great as Chan is, and as much as he carries most films he's in with his sweet charms and likable personas, Wilson comes across as equally likable as Chan. Chan's martial arts are usually the highlights of these films, but in this he proves he can do more than just kick -- he can be funny. Well, okay, he proved that in \"Rush Hour\" (1998), but I like this better. The jokes in \"Shanghai Noon\" aren't \"great,\" but I laughed a lot at this film. It's smarter than one might think, and is certainly one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in quite some time. Probably years. I wasn't expecting much (especially because I wasn't an enormous fan of the sequel--see below), but if fun could be rated on a scale of 1 - 10, this would be an 11. I give this film nothing more than four out of five stars because it's not a great film on all critical levels. But it's certainly fun--likely more fun than any film you'll see for quite some time--and for that it will soon be earning a place in my sacred DVD collection. I must say that I wasn't a huge fan of \"Shanghai Knights,\" the sequel to \"Shanghai Noon,\" which involved Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon venturing to England in order to save Wang's sister. But after seeing this film I'm thinking I might just have to pay a small revisit the sequel again. 4/5 stars. - John Ulmer",
         "When Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped and taken to American by Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), the honour guard of The Forbidden City is dispatched to deliver the ransom and bring her back. Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) accompanies the guards on their journey and finds himself entangled with Indians, cowboys and the greedy attentions of train robber Roy O'Brannon (Owen Wilson). This is essentially a mismatched buddy movie transferred to the American West and in that respect it is not exact an original plot, there aren't any great twists to grab you and a lot of the plot drivers are forced or predictable. However let's be honest - we're not hear for the plot! As with the Rush Hour movies, the plot is secondary to the comedy and the fight scenes. Here Owen Wilson provides the comedy as the laid back train robber while Jackie Chan provides the action and the comedy. The strength here is that this is a little unassuming film that will take you by surprise. The chemistry between Wilson and Chan is effortless and is as comfortable as the Chan/Tucker combo. Wilson's character is hilarious in a very easy way - he is clearly so out of place in the West and partially accepts it but also wants to be more than he is, as one of the bad guys put it \"you're terrible. How have it made it this long?\" Chan again shows that he is the closest we have to a modern day Chaplin, he is as good at interacting with Wilson as he is with the physical comedy that is his trademark. One complaint is that, as with Rush Hour, we could probably have done with a few more fight scenes. However the comedy more than fills any voids that are between fights. Other cast members are little more than excuses for the action. Roger Yuan and Xander Berkeley provide good baddies (Berkeley especially) but Lucy Liu is almost in her own little 'serious' movie and doesn't have much to do except be rescued (although she does show some of her \"Charlie's Angels\" potential in a fight scene towards the end). Overall a gentle enjoyable comedy that is made all the more enjoyable by the ease by which it succeeds at making you laugh. Chan's fights are a little less impressive than other films but he excels in the comedy stakes. One very good thing is the customary outtakes at the end - unlike Rush Hour 2 they are NOT funnier than the rest of the film.",
         "Jackie Chan does it again; this time with \"Shanghai Noon.\" Unlike his previous films, Jackie has finally found a sidekick that works well alongside him and is able to play off of his physical stunts. \"Shanghai Noon\" is unlike any other Jackie Chan movie I have seen. It is his best since \"Rush Hour\" and is among one of the best all-action movies that I've seen with an actual plot behind it. After watching previous Jackie Chan movies such as \"Rush Hour\" and \"Rumble In The Bronx, I was expecting to be dazzled with his comedic talent as well as action filled sequences. I was pleasantly surprised to learn it had every one of the components and requirements that I require for a good movie. Owen Wilson was comedic treat to this film as he added spark to an already great movie. Other than the cliché plot, \"Shanghai Noon\" brings a lot of excellent comedy, dialogue, action, thrills and even a little romance. I was expecting Owen Wilson to be similar to Chris Tucker, but in \"Shanghai Noon\" Wilson proved himself to be much better than other Jackie Chan sidekicks I've seen him teamed with. I was glad I rented this movie so I would be able to recommend it to everyone.",
         "Jackie Chan is a master martial artist and stuntman. Every film he stars in is an exercise in demonstrating his skill in different, creative ways. If you go to see this movie expecting anything different, you'll be sorely disappointed. However, if you're a Chan fan, prepare to be amazed once again. It's not the same spectacle one would find in previous works such as Rumble in the Bronx, but impressive nevertheless. Furthermore, the plot that ties these action sequences together is better than can be found in most films of the same genre. The clash between far east and wild west cultures and cinematographic stereotypes is amusing enough to keep the film entertaining throughout, and Chan's own tongue-in-cheek sense of humor makes the piece that much more delightful to watch. Don't look for this one at the next Academy Awards, but then that's not what Jackie Chan is all about, is it. If you want a couple of hours of mindless entertainment and spectacle, this is the one to see.",
         "'Shanghai Noon' is a western-comedy starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Chan is Chon Wang (sounds like John Wayne) and Wilson is Roy O'Bannon, a perfect name for the outlaw he is. Wang is in the USA because he has to save a princess, played by Lucy Liu. He and O'Bannon have to work together, why and how is not important at all. What is important is the fun they have together, and therefore the fun we have while watching that. We have the usual Jackie Chan martial art and this time it is combined with the very funny Owen Wilson talking. For some reason I like him in almost every movie and here he gets at least one laugh in every scene. Try not to think too much and you must be able to enjoy this movie as much as I did.",
         "Spoilers herein. Martial arts movies have a hard time in the US. There is a small core audience that likes to see fighting of any type, and a still smaller group interested in the ballet. So to make the numbers, producers wrap them in something else: racial commentary, cop buddy movies, the thriller, comedy. Jackie Chan was always a comedian, but in China, his comedy was in the actual fights. That won't work here, so he has been forced to search for a comedy form. And boy he's tried a lot of them and failed. I think this is his most successful. That's because of Owen Wilson. Owen is not the type of old fashioned actor who tries to adapt to each role. He's the John Wayne, Harrison Ford type who markets a personae that people can exploit if they wish. When Bruce Willis does this, his commodity is a smirk; he is winking at the audience in a layered conspiracy as if to say: `I'm acting this stupid role, so chuckle along with me at how stupid it is.' He didn't pioneer this attitude, but inherited it from Cary Grant, who adapted it from some of Clark Gable's winks. Willis has spawned a bunch of copies, some of whom Chan has tried on. Now along comes Owen Wilson. What Owen sells is a whole next generation of audience-winking. With him, the attitude is `You and I know this role is bogus, so lets trash it.' Its the attitude we all know from some guy in school who made trouble by going along. TeeVee opened a niche for this attitude in acting, and now Wilson is making a career of it. Stiller does this too, and that's why `Zoolander' was such a gas; it exploited just this sort of posing. I'm amazed at how many places Wilson has made this work. His ironic comedy of course. But `Minus Man' was made more chilling with him doing his thing, trashing his own locker. Garofalo is the queen to his king of selfdeprecation, and made `Minus' work. Now consider this film. What works is the completely goofy space Wilson creates. As an example, that speech to himself at the showdown with the sheriff: `I'm going to die! No, be the bullet, be the wind, you can do this. No, I'm going to die!' Interspersed with Chan crushing the posse with a horseshoe. Its rather clever engineering of mood, and the creative force behind this film needs to be congratulated. This is Wilson's best comedy, I think, because we aren't asked to laugh at him. He sets the tone for Chan to step into so we can laugh at him. Its more comfortable and less risky than laughing at ourselves. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",
         "Perhaps that statement is a bit of an exaggeration, but perhaps I'm on to something. The obvious natural and easy chemistry between Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson went a long way towards endearing this work into my collection. As a solid fan of Chan's work, I have a modest (in comparison to hard-core fans) collection of his works. In consideration, I have to say that...while this attempt, like his other American attempts, does not exhibit enough of that marvelous comedic fighting style we all know and love, Shanghai Noon is genuinely enchanting, action packed, earnest, and entertaining. Owen Wilson is a natural talent. He brings an honesty to his otherwise shifty personae in everything he does. Frankly, I'm surprised at some of the places he has succeeded in making this work for him. He is a true comedic force on the big screen. This work is a rival to other comedy/action teams, and bears a serious viewing, as I feel it is comparable to my second favorite comedy western, \"Cat Ballou.\" In case you're interested, \"Blazing Saddles\" is my first. If you enjoyed this, I highly recommend the following: Jackie Chan: Mr. Nice Guy, Rumble in the Bronx, and Around the World in 80 Days (2004) Owen Wilson: Anaconda, The Haunting (1999), and the Big Bounce. It rates an 8.2/10 from... the Fiend :."
