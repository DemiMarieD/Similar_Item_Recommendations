            "content": "Harry, he is still the law.\r\n \r\nMagnum Force is directed by Ted Post and collectively written by Harry and Rita Fink, John Milius and Michael Cimino. It stars Clint Eastwood, Hal Holbrook, Mitchell Ryan, David Soul, Felton Perry, Tim Matheson and Robert Urich. Music is by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by  Frank Stanley.\r\n \r\nThe second Dirty Harry movie finds Inspector Callahan on the trail of a vigilante group who are offing Frisco\u2019s villains.\r\n \r\nFollowing in the wake of Dirty Harry was never going to be easy, Don Siegel\u2019s film was very much a trail blazer of sorts, giving the movie lovers of the world a different cop than that which was accustomed. So what to do with Magnum Force then, the inevitable sequel given Dirty Harry\u2019s popularity? The makers come up with a great idea, have Harry confront a group of vigilantes who believe in his own kill crime ethics, only the take it to the extreme.\r\n \r\nSo begins a trail of blood for Harry to follow which leads him right where we the viewers pretty much knew he was going to end up. Post is no Siegel, and although the action and all round testosterone feel that so marked out the Dirty Harry films is exciting and evident respectively, there\u2019s periods where the film meanders. The instances that serve to add more complexity to Harry\u2019s make-up is welcome, but aside from a jumping bean turn from Holbrook, the director can\u2019t get much out of the rest of the cast, as shame since there\u2019s a lot of up and coming talent and stalwarts in the mix.\r\n \r\nStill, even with its evident problems it\u2019s a lively and entertaining sequel, one that doesn\u2019t shy away from pushing some buttons and baiting of critics who had disdain for the first film. The ending is a disappointment, though, but the journey is ultimately meaty and macho. 7/10",

      "synopsis": "The opening credits are played over a shot of a Smith & Wesson Model 29 revolver against a red background. When the credits finish playing, Harry Callahan's voice tells the audience, \"This the .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. And it could blow your head clean off. Do you feel lucky?\" The hand turns the revolver and fires at the camera. Labor racketeer and local mobster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) drives away from court after being acquitted on a technicality for the killing of a labor union leader and his family, much to the outrage of a mob of protesters outside the courthouse. A SFPD motorcycle cop with a photo on his dresser sees this on a TV broadcast and puts on his helmet and gear, then leaves his house. Ricca, his attorney Weinstein, a bodyguard, and his driver James \"Gino\" Cantina drive a limo south on I-280 towards Potrero Hill. A motorcycle policeman catches up to the car and gestures for the driver to pull over. The driver pulls off onto a side street at the next exit, and comes to a stop. The cop walks up to the car and asks the driver for his license, telling him that he illegally crossed a double-white line. At Ricca's attorney's urging, the driver reluctantly hands over his license. The cop goes back to his bike, supposedly to write down information in his ticket book. After a few minutes, he returns and asks the driver for his vehicle registration. The driver asks to get his license back. In response, the cop suddenly whips his revolver out and shoots the limo driver in the side of the face. He then shoots the bodyguard in the passenger's seat as he tries to draw a pistol. He then puts two bullets each into Ricca and his attorney in the backseat. With all four men dead, the cop holsters his smoking revolver, walks back to his motorcycle and rides away. Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) and his partner Earlington 'Early' Smith (Felton Perry) drive by the crime scene, but are asked to leave by Harry's newest adversary on the force, the hot-tempered Lt. Neil Briggs, who had Harry \"loaned\" from Homicide to Stakeout because he despises his methods. The loathing is mutual; Harry detests Briggs because of Briggs's hands-off, bleeding-heart law enforcement methods - Riggs proudly boasts that he's never unholstered his gun once in all his years of police work, which leads the unimpressed Harry to mock Briggs with the words, \"A man's got to know his limitations.\" Harry and Early leave the scene and head to San Francisco International Airport to take lunch at a snack shop run by Bill McKenzie, a former buddy of Harry's from the force. Early, a comparatively wet-behind-the-ears youngster on the force, is grossed out when McKenzie talks about the Ricca killing and a case he worked on involving a gruesome axe murder, all the while Harry chows down on his burger as though nothing is untoward. But a code signal for trouble comes, and Harry notices a group of concerned airport officials gathering around a small cul-de-sac. Harry investigates and finds that airport security is sweating out the hijacking of a jetliner; Harry flashes his badge and learns the hijackers want an overseas pilot, so Harry makes a suggestion. Dressed as a pilot, Harry gets aboard the plane and begins taxiing towards the runway for takeoff, but when the copilot asks if he knows how to fly, he admits that he never had a lesson... which shocks the gunmen in the cockpit long enough for Harry to disarm one and kill the other, and gives him opportunity to show up Lt. Briggs when he arrives at the scene. The dislike between Callahan and Briggs escalates; when the surprised Briggs arrives at the now-freed aircraft Harry mockingly asks him, \"What are you doing here, Lieutenant?\" and leaves while the lieutenant seethes at being shown up. Later Harry arrives at a target range near Oakland and encounters an old friend, traffic officer Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan). McCoy has recently left his wife Carol, though it is clear he still holds her close to his heart, and is bitter over how his life has changed. Harry, concerned, suggests Charlie retire, but Charlie vows never to do so and instead \"go out fighting\". In the target range Harry encounters four rookie traffic cops Philip Sweet (Tim Matheson), John Davis (David Soul), Donald \"Red\" Astrachan (Kip Niven), and Michael Grimes (Robert Urich), who practice incessantly and are inseparable buddies from their days as Army Rangers. Harry chats with them for a few minutes and even lets Phil Sweet try his .44; he is impressed by Sweet's dexterity with the heavy revolver and with the four young policemen overall. The next day, the mystery motorcycle cop drives out to Tiburon, and the hillside estate of a known gangster who is hosting a swimming party. After parking his bike, he walks up the hill, creeping through the bushes, equipped with a satchel charge and an M76 sub-machine gun. He tosses the satchel charge into the pool to get the attention of the party-goers, who stare up at him, at which point he opens fire - gunning down everyone in attendance. As the bodies lie dead around or even in the pool, the officer walks back to his motorcycle and rides away. Briggs appears later on a broadcast condemning the violence. Harry is watching the newscast at Carol McCoy's house, and she is glad that the ordeal of her divorce is now over; she then asks Harry why he's never hit on her, but her seduction is interrupted by the play of her rambunctious children, then by a phone call to Harry from Early, who is part of a stakeout at a general store where possible robbery suspects have arrived. Harry thus is forced to cut short his dinner date with Carol and drive to the back entrance of the Cost Plus World Market on Taylor Street, where through a two-way mirror in the manager's office, he and a uniformed officer monitor as Early and two checkout associates attend to customers. A man who is at the magazine rack leaves and then returns with three salty-looking dudes who promptly conjure shotguns and pistols. The group's leader punches the store's eldest associate, orders him to find the store safe, and then orders Early to his knees - a fatal mistake, for it gives Harry the opening to shoot him through the mirror. A gun battle erupts. Early shoots one of the robbers out front, the driver gets away, and the last man is shot dead by Harry. After the robbery is stopped, Harry and Early return to headquarters to finish the ensuing paperwork and they pass the four rookie cops, whom Early knows from their days at the police academy. Later that night, we see a prostitute cut in line at the Fairmont Hotel downtown to get a taxicab. When she is about to climb out of the cab at her destination, the pimp (Albert Popwell) she is coming to see suddenly appears out of nowhere and roughly shoves her back into the cab and orders the driver to take off. He finds that she has been holding money from him and warns her that she just had her last chance. Angered, he attacks her and attempts to rape her. The cab driver, seeing the struggle, stops the cab and runs off to call the police. Inside the cab, the pimp pours an entire bottle of drain cleaner into the girl's mouth. As she writhes and convulses, the pimp takes his hat and the emptied bottle with him as he leaves, and we see the prostitute's arm fall out, limp, and dead. The next morning, the pimp is driving across the Golden Gate Bridge when the vigilante motorcycle cop catches up to him and signals for him to pull over. The pimp takes the first exit, makes a left turn through the underpass, and stops on the service road underneath the north approach to the bridge. The pimp, as an extra precaution, hides a revolver under his crotch between his pant legs. The motorcycle cop dismounts his bike and walks up to the car, and claims to have caught the pimp speeding. He asks the pimp for his license and vehicle registration, and the pimp pulls out his wallet, flipping it to show his license, as well as a wad of $100 bills. He fails to notice the cop slowly raising his revolver. The pimp's eyes suddenly widen with horror just as the cop shoots him in the side of the neck. As the pimp writhes in the seat, the cop empties the rest of his bullets into his chest. The cop then re-holsters his revolver, walks back to his motorcycle, and rides off as the pimp bleeds to death. Harry returns home that night where a new neighbor, a young woman named Sunny, greets him; a long-time admirer of his heroism, Sunny offers Harry her own gratitude by asking to bed him. But they are interrupted when Lt. Briggs calls Harry to the city morgue to view the bodies of victims of the vigilante, all of them known criminals, which include the freshly deceased pimp. Harry is reassigned to Homicide by his and Briggs's superior, Captain Avery, but a clue is difficult to come by there are no witnesses to the murders though uniformed patrolmen keep finding the bodies, and ballistics checks of the bullets reveal uselessly generic information about the weapons used. The next day, Harry and Early examine a bullet recovered from the pimp's body that proves to be a .357 Magnum round. Harry and Early also examine the pimp's car at the crime lab, learning from the ballistics expert that the killer emptied an entire magazine into the pimp from point-blank range. When he notices that the pimp was holding out his driver's license and a $100 bill like he was trying to bribe a traffic cop, Harry begins to suspect that the killer of these criminals is someone they'd never suspect. He thus begins to clash with Briggs when Briggs suspects harbor side racketeer Frank Palancio, who had worked with Ricca in the past, may be behind the murders. Harry and Early tail Palancio and harass him as he is driven around the city. But elsewhere, the vigilante cop reaches the top of a penthouse in Pacific Heights, puts a silencer on his revolver, and guns down drug kingpin Lou Guzman and three of his associates (who are being monitored by Harry's friend Frank DiGiorgio and his partner from an office building a block away) with a suppressed Colt Python. As the killer makes his way to the basement, he runs into Charlie McCoy, exiting the utility room. McCoy seems to recognize the killer cop and thinks he is just another fellow officer... until the killer cop raises his revolver and shoots McCoy in the chest. McCoy falls, his helmet falling off, at which point the mystery cop shoots him again in the head, then leaves. Upon seeing DiGiorgio, the cop tells them of McCoy's shooting, then holds back bystander. The killer cop removes his helmet... revealing himself to be Davis. Lt. Briggs chews out Harry for harassing Palancio before revealing McCoy's death. Harry and Davis see Charlie's widow and her kids off for the funeral flight back east, and Harry thanks Davis for showing his support. But Harry harbors suspicions about Davis; when they stumble into a robbery attempt at a bowling alley they subdue the robbers before Davis furiously dresses down bystanders for letting such crimes take place. Later, Davis and Harry compete in a police shooting contest. To prove his suspicions right, Harry borrows Davis's revolver and deliberately misses one target. He recovers it and matches it to the bullets from Charlie McCoy's body. But Harry is reluctant to reveal all he knows when he shows Lt. Briggs a bullet under a forensic microscope, as he now trusts no one. His mistrust proves warranted when a police raid hits Palancio's harborside offices. Harry has asked for Davis and Sweet to back him up. Palancio and his men are having lunch in the office when they receive an anonymous phone call from an unseen person warning them that they will be attacked in two minutes by hit men disguised as cops. When Sweet knocks on the door, Palancio blasts him from behind the door with a shotgun, and a gun battle ensues. Harry takes out one thug wielding a sub-machine gun before backup arrives. After backup arrives, Davis manages to take out two thugs in the main office single-handedly. As Palancio attempts to flee, Harry clings onto the hood of his car, distracting Palancio, who dies when he takes a wrong turn and is skewered on a crane. When Briggs and Captain Avery try to blame Harry for the debacle, Harry fights back by noting Palancio's men fired first, indicating they were tipped off. Briggs refuses to believe it, vows to ruin Callahan's career, and has Harry hand over the bullet he showed earlier. But the bullet is a fake, as Harry still has the one he found earlier. He now reveals all to Early Smith as he gives him the bullet to give to Briggs if anything happens to Harry. Harry, however, is confronted by the three surviving vigilante cops in the garage of his apartment who make him an offer to join their organization of killing criminals. Harry responds: \"I'm afraid you've misjudged me\". The three vigilante cops then leave. Harry discovers and defuses a bomb in his mailbox apparently left by the vigilantes in case he refused their offer, but a second bomb kills Early. Briggs arrives and asks Callahan to drive to police headquarters with the bomb. But in the car Briggs draws his .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson Model 19 snubnose revolver and forces the inspector to disarm. Briggs reveals himself as the leader of the death squad, cites the traditions of frontier justice and summary executions, and says, \"You're a great cop, Harry... but you'd rather stick with the system.\" Callahan responds, \"I hate the goddamn system! But until someone comes along with some changes that make sense, I'll stick with it.\" Briggs then instructs Harry to get off at the next exit, and as Harry looks in the rear-view mirror he sees Grimes following them. Instantly Harry knows he's been set up. Harry overpowers Briggs and knocks him unconscious, then dumps Briggs out of the car at a shipyard. He then kills the pursuing Grimes by hitting him head-on with his car. He runs onto an old aircraft carrier as the remaining two vigilante cops arrive. The unarmed Harry evades his pursuers and beats Astrachan to death in one of the abandoned ship's hallways, then takes his motorcycle with Davis in pursuit. After a series of daring jumps on the carrier, the two cyclists run out of deck space; Harry is able to stop, but Davis is unable to stop in time, and rides straight off the carrier deck and into the water, where he drowns. Harry looks down at Davis's body floating in the water and contemptuously says, \"Briggs was right you guys don't have enough experience\". As Harry stumbles back to his damaged car, Briggs appears again, his .38 snubnose aimed squarely at Harry. The crooked Lieutenant menaces the inspector and threatens to prosecute Harry for killing fellow cops. Harry stealthily activates the timer on the mail bomb as Briggs gets into the car and drives off. The bomb explodes before Briggs has driven 100 feet, killing the corrupt Lieutenant. The final scene of the movie is a close-up of Harry's face as he again says the movie's famous tagline: \"A man's got to know his limitations\", before he walks away.",

         "I sometimes wonder if \"Magnum Force\" is a better movie than \"Dirty Harry.\" In the latter, Harry Calahan is up against a psycho causing panic, while in \"Magnum Force\" Harry opposes a number of enemies: enemies he would not have expected at first. Crime is still on the rise, there is too much corruption and too few 'real' cops, like him. When he meets some young, aspiring cops he is amazed by their qualities. Great acting by Clint Eastwood who is just perfect in playing the old-fashioned Harry Callahan. There is violence, but the strange thing is you support Callahan in 'cleaning' the city. One of the best in the Dirty Harry-series.",
         "A racketeer, Carmine Ricca, has been cleared of murder, due to the usual and frustrating court technicality... He leaves, a happy and free man... Not for long... A motorcycle cop pulls his car over, seemingly for a traffic violation and ruthlessly slaughters him and the other three occupants... Harry is soon on the scene, this time with a new black partner, Early Smith (Felton Perry). It transpires that Harry is no longer in the homicide squad, he's been demoted to a stake-out squad by Detective Briggs (Hal Holbrook) because of his previous unconventional methods... Nevertheless he soon demonstrates that he has lost none of his considerable skills... Enjoying a hamburger at San Francisco Airport he becomes involved in a hijack... Harry meets an old colleague Charlie McCoy (Mitch Ryan) who seems unnaturally upset about the ineffectiveness of the courts and Harry fears that he may be the killer cop... Later, in the police firing range, he meets four young traffic cops who are more than impressed by his former lethal methods... With a wave of underworld killings on the increase, Harry is eventually told to work with Briggs to solve them... He still suspects the murderer is McCoy until the latter is killed and, by setting a clever trap to check the bullets in the guns of the four young motorcycle cops, Harry finds that they are the guilty persons... \"Magnum .44\" is much bloodier than \"Dirty Harry.\" The lack of emotion emerges in Harry's character... He is a powerful and dominating figure who shoots first and asks questions later... Director Ted Post takes him from below to imprint his stature on the piece... Eastwood is solid enough but not as penetrating as it was in \"Dirty Harry.\" He even have sex... Inevitably, as is usual with his persona, the initiative has to come from the female, unsuccessfully from McCoy's widow and extremely directly from the pretty little Japanese girl who lives downstairs... She gazes up at Eastwood and says: \"What does a girl have to do to go to bed with you?\" He replies: \"Try knocking at the door.\" They've only known each other for about half a minute, making it one of the swiftest screen seductions on record, and it illustrates the fact that Eastwood's sex appeal is instant and uncomplicated... He is the conventional tough-guy par excellence \u0096 handsome, laconic, cynical, determined and independent; clearly a man to be idolized by other men and worshiped by women...",
         "This sequel to the entertaining \"Dirty Harry\" stands with few peers when it comes to successful follow-ups. Most don't stand on their own feet but Magnum Force does solidly. Changing the plot but not the style is good formula in movies, rather than playing out what was already done in the original, which is why so many sequels fail. \"Magnum Force\" is my second favorite film by Eastwood after \"High Plains Drifter\". Harry still likes to do things his way although rather than focusing his energy on the bad guys, he's focused on some crooked cops in his own department! Follows in the original's footsteps with lots of great views of San Francisco (My Birthplace!) I always feel at home when watching this movie. This is another film that is played a lot on TV because its so good on it's own. Felton Perry does a good job as Harry's partner, comparable to Reni Santoni in the original. Didn't like any of the sequels that followed this movie with the exception of Sudden Impact. Magnum Force is a film that rates highly as watchable again & again.",
         "After a known criminal, with clout over the city, manages to escape the punishment of the law, he and his partners are gunned down by a vigilante dressed as a cop and with a .44 Magnum. Drawn to the case Infamous San Francisco Detective \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan starts to investigate as the vigilante continues to take out criminals citywide. Soon there are suspicions that the criminals are getting their information from inside the police force. If there is one actor that can be plainly badass, macho, and tough in the most stereotypical way without making a fool of himself, it's Clint Eastwood. Never has an actor been so plain and stoic, yet so entertaining and funny at the same time. That's because Eastwood knows his limitations and, as a result, never becomes totally ridiculous. Whether he's dropping one liners, shooting his cannon of a revolver, or mysteriously seducing women with no effort whatsoever Clint Eastwood just plays it cool. Steve McQueen also managed the same with his classic \"Bullitt\" and Dirty Harry uses essentially the same formula, but it does it well with its own unique spin and style. Also Clint Eastwood has lived well past McQueen's early death so his films are more prevalent in the current movie mindset. The film isn't quite perfect and there is one sequence in particular - at the airport where Harry takes out two hijackers single handedly - that seems to be just there to show that Harry Callahan is a badass who makes his own rules and gets things done. Yet this scene does nothing to advance the plot. With the film clocking in at over two hours this could have easily been dropped. Along with a few trimmings here and there for a slightly brisker film. That said, the movie remains entertaining and a good part of Eastwood's action era. --- 8/10 Rated R for violence",
         "Ted Post directed and John Milius and Michael Cimino wrote this first sequel to Don Siegel's classic gritty police drama, Dirty Harry (1971). Magnum Force (1973) is not as near as effective or powerful as the first and original film, but this sequel is watchable and has its merits, too. Harry is now investigating strange killings of criminals, pimps, dirty politicians and others, so the killer is killing \"bad guys\" this time. Harry starts to investigate the cases, and he has his doubts about all this. Then the truth is revealed and also, unfortunately, spoilt in most of the reviews and comments I've read. Harry has again his usual opponents, mostly his colleagues and superiors who don't accept his tough style. Harry wants to do justice, but by using his own ways and moral. If talking doesn't help, then the magnum .44 will. I don't think this or the first film are fascist, but realistic and honest, and extremely bleak depictions of world and society which is more or less collapsing because of its inhabitants. This film manages still to tell something about that, but the next sequel, The Enforcer, is pretty lame in comparison. Magnum Force has pretty fat plot and many different characters and sub plots, without being too confusing. Towards the end, the film becomes perhaps too predictable and unbelievable, and I think the ending should have needed little tightening. Now it is little unnecessary shoot outs and nothing else. The film runs two hours, which is the longest running time in the \"series\", but still this manages to interest and even surprise, but if they had finished the film some 20 minutest earlier, this would be even more noteworthy film. Now it has nothing too important to offer during its finale, and so the finale becomes little unnecessary, in my opinion. As an action film, this is pretty exciting and shot with talent. The action scenes are often fast and full of gunpowder and fire, so director Post can surely direct with skill. The film is pretty brutal and violent at times, and this again shows the fact that films this gritty and violent are not made in Hollywood nowadays, at least not too often. Magnum Force is much more easier and \"positive\" film than its predecessor, and that's why it hasn't got so many things to offer and give. This is pure action film where the first film was also many other things, too, like social commentary and talking about things many would not want to talk about. Magnum Force gets 7/10, but fortunately still has its positive things and even little bit of the power that made Dirty Harry so immortal.",
         "Magnum Force turns up the heat a little more than Dirty Harry. There is a little more gunplay and more of the sizzling 70's soundtrack that helped Dirty Harry be so groovy. Clint returns of course as Dirty Harry Callahan, this time after a small group of rogue cops. All the Dirty Harry movies are great and this is the 2nd best in the series, after Dirty Harry. The streets of San Francisco provides a beautiful backdrop, and Hal Halbrook does a great job of playing the continually annoyed chief. Bottom Line: Magnum Force meets the bar set by Dirty Harry and does a fabulous job of continuing the series.",
         "If you were to ask film goer's which character or movie they would associate with Clint Eastwood it would probably be his portrayal of the no-nonsense crime buster inspector Harry Callahan. Of course Eastwood had done some very popular movies prior to this including his spaghetti westerns in the 1960's and even after the Harry Callahan run he has gone on to do some well acclaimed films in front of as well as behind the camera. It's worth mentioning this because despite being well into his seventies he's still in demand as actor and director which is a testament to his movie making abilities and longevity that spans fifty years! All in all an impressive achievement. Be that as it may, when you play the character of Harry Callahan five times over an 18 year period it's hard for fans not to associate him with the part. MAGNUM FORCE might actually be a tad better than DIRTY HARRY as well as being the best of the sequels. Not only do we learn a bit more about Inspector Callahan but also it's a more interesting and compelling story as well as having a better all round cast. Well, at least it seems that way as time has gone by, because the supporting cast of David Soul, Tim Matheson and Robert Urich who play the easy-going traffic cops would go on to be well known stars in their own right through the 70's, 80's, 90's and 2000's. In addition they are backed up by the brilliant Hal Holbrook playing the impatient and easily irritated lieutenant Briggs. Tough street wise cops were not a new thing to Hollywood, but because of the civil rights movements in the 1960's and 70's there were a lot of new rules that the police had to adhere to and their methods came under greater judicial scrutiny. If there was a whiff of wrong doing, the judge would instruct that critical testimony should be dismissed and vital evidence rendered inadmissible thus making the DA's prosecution impossible and an acquittal or a dismissal of a case a certainty. They had rights! As a consequence it seemed that the courts became a sanctuary or a get out of jail card for the criminals! Also, rather than having some dopey public defender the criminals gained access to the new breed of wise-guy smarmy lawyers who would use all forms of court room trickery to gain acquittals for their clients. Whether it was organized crime, pimps, murderers, rapists and muggers the system seemed to work in their favor. Also, politicians became sensitive to the minority communities complaints of police strong armed tactics leaned on local police forces to ease off. All this coincided with an explosion of violent crime in the early 1970's where the public particularly in the big cities became anxious and frustrated at this. Therefore movies such as DIRTY HARRY where Harry used his own methods to get his man and DEATH WISH which encouraged the public to fight back using the same methods as the hoods all captured the public imagination. In the follow up, MAGNUM FORCE explored the possibility of vigilante cops acting as judge, jury and executioner because the system seemed not to be working. Inspector Callahan is not impressed by these new methods and shrugs off pressure from above. The beginning of the movie sets the tone, from his indifference towards the gunned down thugs as well as the way he tackled the hijacked plane only demonstrated the way he wanted to do his job. When it appears that some one is trying to put the courts out of business as the body bags that are piling up in the cities morgue are San Francisco's dregs of the earth, Callahan has the unenviable task of finding out who is responsible for this? Harry at first thinks that it is some rouge cop acting out of impulse who might be the one responsible for these revenge killings but as things progress it appears that this is not just a random or a spur of the moment act. Callahan becomes suspicious towards a well disciplined team of rookie cops who he knows are expert marksman. It appears that they are a highly motivated and are a product of a well organized shadow police force who have support much higher up the chain of command. Although Callahan has no empathy towards the people who are being killed and to a large extent understands why somebody might carry out such a deed, he is much happier catching them in the act and blowing them away in a shoot out. He is uneasy at the blatant execution style of these killings and is way beyond what he thinks is right! As his investigation unfolds, he too becomes a target and when his partner gets rubbed out it seems that he may have crossed more than just the mayor and the chief of police! Now with nobody watching his back, can he get to the bottom of this before he becomes a victim, and more importantly who can he trust? There are obvious plot holes but it is more than compensated by great cinema photography with great shots of San Francisco, shoot outs, an easy going back ground score and and of course a very smooth Clint Eastwood to boot. The sparing between Briggs and Callahan is entertaining and produces some great dialog, it's well worth a watch and I'd highly recommend this to 70's movie buffs and Clint Eastwood fans!.",
         "It seems that between \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Magnum Force\" Inspector \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan,Clint Eastwood, had learned the value of the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution. Unlike in the first \"Dirty Harry\" movie where Harry was the sole judge jury and executioner of all those that he deemed were guilty of crimes against the people of the city of San Francisco. In \"Magnum Force\" Harry actually believes in letting the system do it's job and not take the law into your, or Harry's,own hands. A number of the top criminals in San Francisco from corrupt labor leaders to sadistic street pimps have been done away with by what seems to be a rouge element of the SF Police Department and Harry's boss lieut. Briggs, Hal Holbrook, wants to find out just who's responsible. Harry, between shooting plane hijackers and convenient store hold up men, is also interested in stopping these criminals in uniform since their breaking the law, like average criminals, and the very thought of them breaking the law just gets Harry's Irish up. Inspector Harry Callahan is assigned to take part in the bust of a mob hideout and when the police operation is put into full gear something goes wrong, the mobsters are tipped off, and a policeman and a number of mobsters, most of them by Harry, are killed in the shoot-out that follows. Harry realizes that there's someone in the police force that's behind all those vigilant killings and tipped off the gangsters in order to have them killed in the shoot-out! That instead of having them arrested and and brought to trial. It's decided there and then by \"Dirty Harry\" Callahan that not only is he going to put a stop to those killings but also to those who are doing them: Dirty Harry style! By far the best of the \"Dirty Harry\" movies with Clint Eastwood never better in his role as \"Dirty Harry\" Callahan in the most action-packed and exciting \"Dirty Harry\" film ever made. Eastwood is much freer and less constraint then he was in the first \"Dirty Harry\" film. Which makes the action go faster and also make it far more exciting with a great cast and a much better action director, Ted Post. Post keep things moving when it comes to keeping the tempo of the action in the movie up and the talking and explaining down, by Harry and his fellow police officers and friends, as to why Harry is called \"Dirty Harry\" every ten minutes in the film like in the first \"Dirty Harry\" movie. Great ending sequence at the San Francisco Navy Yard with Harry taking care of business by doing in the bad guys and making the city safe again until the next \"Dirty Harry\" film comes blazing along.",
         "'Dirty Harry' was a two-pronged success for Clint Eastwood, as the 1971 thriller broke new ground in police films and earned over $28 million at the box office. With this good fortune, however, came backlash from writers such as Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert who judged the movie as 'fascist' and an endorsement of police brutality. The first Dirty Harry sequel, 1973's 'Magnum Force,' was a direct response to these claims and hoped to build on Harry's already-solid marketing power. 'Magnum Force' opens at City Hall in San Francisco, where mobster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) has been acquitted of killing a union leader and his entire family. Ricca is free on a technicality and drawing protests from those already sick of loopholes in the American justice system. When returning home from the trial, Ricca and his legal team are pulled over by a sunglass-wearing motorcycle cop who shoots dead all four men. San Francisco's felons are dying in mysterious hits and the police have almost no clues. Inspector Harry Callahan (Eastwood), who has been transferred from the homicide division and worked recent months on stakeout, is ordered to investigate. The assignment comes unwillingly from Lieutenant Briggs (Hal Holbrook), a by-the-book administrator who is disgusted with Callahan's tactics. Callahan soon realizes that four motorcycle cops (David Soul, Tim Matheson, Kip Niven, and Robert Urich) are members of a sub-organization called Magnum Force that aims to wipe out crime in San Francisco, regardless of the cost to human life. Harry, who is seen as a prototype by Magnum Force, refuses to support it; he believes that any such group would endanger honest citizens rather than protect them. One can't expect 'Magnum Force' to rival its predecessor, but this follow-up is still a major disappointment. The writing, direction, and technical work of 'Magnum Force' simply don't compare to Don Siegel's original film. Magnum Force's screenplay (by John Milius and Michael Cimino) does not have the tight plotting or razor-sharp dialogue that makes 'Dirty Harry' special. The plot is littered with conveniences such as Callahan eating at an airport snack bar when a hijacking occurs and Harry not being able to start a motorbike, which allows David Soul to catch up with him and engage in a chase. Also featured are an unnecessary love interest (played by Adele Yoshioka) and one-dimensional characters who only exist to be tortured and knocked off (including Margaret Avery as a prostitute who swallows drain cleaner). 'Magnum Force' doesn't build on its premise, yet drifts on crude tangents and is much longer (124 minutes) than it needs to be. Don Siegel was replaced by Ted Post as director, whose experience is mainly in television. Post's direction is bland and without a clearly defined style; he frequently uses master shots rather than close-ups of actors and vehicles, which ruins the sinister, closed-in atmosphere that Magnum Force's death squad is supposed to generate. The action scenes are very basic in approach when their energy could have been heightened by some imaginative camera work. These sequences have a degree of excitement, but they rarely walk the levels of 'Dirty Harry,' whose action is quite limited. The cinematography by Frank Stanley is also a major jump down from that of Bruce Surtees in 'Dirty Harry.' 'Magnum Force' has a dreary appearance on lower-quality film stock; combined with the violence and trashy situations, 'Magnum Force' has an atmosphere similar to 'B' films by American International Pictures and Crown International. It's almost hard to believe that 'Magnum Force' was released by Warner Brothers and that Eastwood fills the starring role. Strong performances by Eastwood and Holbrook keep 'Magnum Force' from being a complete disaster. The two veterans play their roles intensely and make the film considerably more entertaining than its script allows for. Supporting roles with Soul, Matheson, Niven, and Urich are effectively played, although their lack of identity in the biker squad makes this whole greater than the sum of its parts. Actors from 'Dirty Harry' such as Albert Popwell and John Mitchum reappear; Felton Perry has a dull turn as Harry's ill-fated partner. Lalo Schifrin is back as composer, which gives the series a further degree of continuity. The brilliant theme song combines his sleek orchestration and wordless vocals. Interestingly, Schifrin's music during the film is mostly background color rather than holding a dominant place. Warner Brothers has released a snapper case version of its 'Magnum Force' DVD, improving the flimsy cardboard version previously sold. The DVD treats 'Magnum Force' with respect, but is weak on extras. 'Force' is presented in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 stereo enhancement; dubbing and subtitles are offered in five languages. Magnum Force's print is in fairly good condition, although grain is visible and colors look faded. Audio presentation is decent; while Schifrin's score comes across nicely, dialogue is sometimes muffled. DVD extras include a commentary track with screenwriter John Milius; 'A Moral Right,' WB's 24-minute program on the social implications of Dirty Harry; 'The Hero Cop,' a short program released during Magnum Force's production; and a gallery with all five trailers from the Dirty Harry series. As a person who doesn't especially like John Milius's work, I found his self-righteous commentary grating. To worsen matters, the new program is only a rehash of ideas from Warner's 'Dirty Harry' DVD; I would've rather seen a 'making of' program that examines 'Magnum Force' in depth. On the plus side, its trailer gallery is an excellent look at Dirty Harry's evolution from 1971 into the 1980s. Harry fans will certainly be entertained (as I was), but the film and DVD never live up to their potential. ** ½ out of 4 Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr",
         "Second outing for Clint Eastwood's anti-hero is an absorbing thriller, let down by some sloppy characterisation and the lack of a killer (no pun intended) scene or even iconic dialogue. It starts off poorly with the title credits lamely played over an almost static shot of the title weapon (very \"Sledge Hammer\") but once we get past the token scene reminding us of Harry's \"shoot first, ask questions later\" policing policy, the main plot strand about an internal police death-squad violently taking out known felons dominates the film. There are some humanising touches around Harry's character, although these stereotypically show him as irresistible to women, rebellious to authority and almost friendly and caring for his young black sidekick, so that nothing new is revealed about what makes him tick. There is something condescending about the treatment of these supporting characters, especially the portrayal of Callahan's young Oriental neighbour who despite hardly seeing him around, seems desperate to jump into bed with him. Better to stick with the action of which there is plenty. There's intrigue as Callahan's instincts lead him to find the true identities of the assassination bureau and a good twist as their ringleader emerges from the shadows. The acting is mostly fine, Eastwood naturally dominating in his typical laconic manner. Hal Holbrook is also excellent as his testy superior and David Soul shines in a pre-Hutch role. Ted Post directs with some flair with some blunt lapses while Lalo Schifrin contributes a typically gritty soundtrack. The film makes its main point about the dangers of vigilantism and cleverly uses Harry Callahan of all people as a counterpoint to its proponents. Some might argue as to whether all the violence was necessary and I felt the grisly death of a black prostitute bordered on the gratuitous but on the whole this was superior cop-fare and a good sequel to the trailblazing \"Dirty Harry\"."

         "After Harry Callahan put an end to the 'Scorpio' murderer, he finds himself taking on a different kind of criminal; the kind that carries a badge. When a man acquitted of murder on a legal technicality is found dead along with his lawyer, chauffeur, and bodyguard, Harry and his new partner 'Early' Smith start to investigate but are ordered off by Harry's boss, Lt. Neil Briggs - a man who Harry despises because of his bleeding-heart approach to law enforcement. Soon after, a mafia figure and several of his family & friends are gunned down at a pool party, and a drug dealer is also murdered. While this is going on, Harry & Early stop an aircraft hijacking and a liquor store robbery. After a well-known pimp is murdered - in circumstances that point to a traffic stop - Harry & Early are reassigned by Briggs to investigate the homicides. When Harry is tasked with arresting mob boss Frank Palancio, the result is a bloodbath in which both Palancio and a young police officer are killed. In addition, Harry's friend & fellow cop Charlie McCoy is savagely murdered - by another cop!

         "There is a quadruple murder in San Francisco that baffles the cops on the scene -- it happened in broad daylight on a crowded street with no sign of a struggle. Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan suspects something unusual. He goes to have burgers at the airport with his new partner, Inspector Early Smith. Dirty Harry shoots a couple of incompetent hijackers, and shortly thereafter, he stops a drugstore hold-up. After more killings follow the quadruple murder, City Hall is putting the pressure on the Police Department to put a stop to the killings. At first, Lieutenant Briggs is reluctant to assign Dirty Harry to the case because of Dirty Harry's attitude problem and penchant for pulling his gun, but when the bodies really start to pile up, Dirty Harry is assigned to the case. Whoever is doing the killing seems only to be selecting criminals, like mobsters, murderous pimps, and other felons. Dirty Harry suspects that they have a vigilante on their hands, quite possibly a cop. Discovering that all the killings have been committed by a .357 Magnum, Dirty Harry suspects that Officer Charlie McCoy is responsible. Many cops and the public, people who are fed up with the system, see the killer as a kind of hero. All is not what it seems after Charlie ends up murdered, and Dirty Harry becomes convinced that it's an inside job. As it turns out, a group of frustrated cops led by Officer John Davis have been killing mobsters, murderous pimps, and other people of that kind who are set free. Davis and his three partners Officer Phil Sweet, Officer Red Astrachan, and Officer Mike Grimes killed Charlie to throw off the police from suspecting a conspiracy. Now it's up to Dirty Harry to find Davis and his crew.",

Inspector Harry Callahan and his new partner Earlington \"Early\" Smith drive by but are asked to leave by Callahan's boss Lt. Neil Briggs, who had Harry and Early transferred out of Homicide to Stakeout because he despises Harry's methods. Another mob figure is gunned down in his pool with a large gathering of guests, but it not until the killing of a known pimp - and after Harry has foiled a plane hijacking and liquor store holdup - that Harry and Early are reassigned to Homicide to head the investigation of these killings. Harry soon clashes with Briggs over the police's primary suspect, Frank Palancio - a clash that becomes hotter when a Palancio associate and a uniformed traffic officer are shot to death, and a subsequent raid on Palancio explodes in a firefight - a raid that Harry finds was a setup by the real killers.",
