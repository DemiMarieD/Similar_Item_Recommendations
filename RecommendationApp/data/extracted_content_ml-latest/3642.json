         "content": "Sweet singing coyotes.\r\n\r\nTall and elegant pharmacist Tom Craig comes to Sacramento to open up his own drug store. On route he incurs the wrath of bully boy Britt Dawson, who doesn't take kindly to his Bostonian manners, however Dawson's girl Lacey Miller does, and along with newly acquired friend Kegs McKeever, Tom has the foundation to see his plans thru to fruition, but Dawson and his loose cannon younger brother are determined to get in the way.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those films that the John Wayne haters should seek out when they use the argument that he always played the same characters. Here he is far from macho, for sure he will be forced to branch out and defend what's right, but his Tom Craig here is gentile and full of grace, very much a gentleman thank you very much. Plot wise we are treated to standard fare, good guys and bad guys just don't get on, and you just know that some pretty dames are going to have a say in proceedings. Yet this piece really has much more going for it, it's sense of fun, courtesy mainly of Edgar Kennedy and Patsy Kelly's blossoming relationship, the advancement of drugs to cure the sick and it's back drop of the Sacremento gold rush, all of it comes together to totally satisfy come the final credits. 7.5/10",

         "In Old California is a fun, surprisingly complex John Wayne vehicle from more positive and principled days. It features a good good guy (gosh, even goes to church! feature that!), a couple of bad bad guys - and even a character that transforms from shady to admirable. It's a move that takes one's attention, keeps it, and sends one off feeling good. If that's your idea of a good movie experience, give it a go.",
         "Will begin by saying that I've been a major John Wayne fan all of my life and have seen many many of his movies, and have screened many of those dozens and scores of times. Recently I viewed this title for the first time. Personally, I feel the film was very well done, and in particular is a solid testament to the fact that the Duke had a much better ability to portray different characters than he has often been credited with. Granted, some Wayne movies are superior to others, but this one had tremendous entertainment value and certainly does not deserve the negative reviews I have read of it. The vast majority of John Wayne's movies rate an overall \"good\" at the very least, and certainly all of them are worth watching once. I highly recommend this one to even the most apathetic, luke-warm John Wayne fans, and even to his most critical detractors as it really was 88 minutes of good entertainment so make some popcorn, snuggle on the couch with your sweetheart and enjoy this unusual John Wayne film...",
         "In Old California finds John Wayne in the highly unusual casting of an eastern dude from Boston going west to California to seek fame and fortune as California becomes American territory due to the Mexican cession. He might be an easterner, but you wouldn't expect John Wayne to be any kind of cream puff. He'd better not be because he's starting to interest Binnie Barnes who is the gal pal of Albert Dekker, the local boss of Sacramento and the surrounding area. Wayne likes Barnes, but he's got his heart set on Helen Parrish who is the daughter of a local Spanish don. You wouldn't expect pharmacy to be such a rough business, but it sure turns out that way In Old California. Out of jealousy, Dekker conceives a plot to rid himself of his rival. Ultimately however it's Dekker who gets caught in the web of his on intrigue. Edgar Kennedy and Patsy Kelly make their one and only appearances in a John Wayne film and they make a real nice pair for the comic relief in the film. Also look for a good performance by Dick Purcell as Dekker's far slimier and deadlier brother. The California Gold Rush saves the Duke from one of Dekker's nefarious schemes. The Gold Rush also brings in the typhoid epidemic where Wayne's pharmaceutical knowledge and supplies are needed to fight the disease. The epidemic also brings on a blazing gun battle as well as the Duke leads a wagon train through to the gold camps. Binnie Barnes has a nice role herself as a wise cracking saloon girl with the proverbial golden heart. Their are plot elements here of other John Wayne films like The Spoilers and Reap the Wild Wind. In this one it's John Wayne who has the role Ray Milland had against him in Reap the Wild Wind. In Old California is one of Herbert J. Yates's better films featuring his meal ticket. Between loaning him out to the bigger studios and centering Republic's big budget features around the Duke, Yates and Wayne did a masterful job in making him a movie legend.",
         "This was a John Wayne film before he became a major star. If you remember this and that this was never meant to be a top-quality film with a big budget, then you will probably see that for what it is, it does very well. This western is a bit better than the average western because Wayne's acting is as good as ever and Albert Dekker is a great villain as well. Plus, the writing is very good for this type of film--with excellent dialog and the plot moves along very nicely as well. So, overall, all the necessary elements for a B-Western are here. Oh, and I almost forgot, it has a lady (Binnie Barnes) who is pretty much there as a plot device (after all, you NEED a woman to come between the men in this type of movie--or so it seems). The bottom line is this is fr from great, but very watchable for those who like the genre.",
         "John Wayne's Westerns in the mid 1930's for Lone Star Productions were typically formulaic, and they show the Duke developing the two fisted no nonsense style of hero he eventually achieved. Republic Pictures picked up the pacing and quality in this 1942 effort, in which John Wayne portrays a druggist on his way West and landing in Sacramento via San Francisco. Tom Craig's (Wayne) gimmick is bending coins, so his strength is not in question when it comes to facing down bad guys. In this case it's town boss Britt Dawson (Albert Dekker), who owns just about everything there is in Sacramento, and what he doesn't he manages to control through strength of will. Dawson's only weakness is his fiancée Lacey Miller (Binnie Barnes), and therein lies the thorn between two antagonists. Lacey has an eye for Craig, and is willing to back his play on opening a pharmacy in Sacramento. At first the deal is fashioned along financial considerations, but Lacey starts balancing her relationship between the two men until she can find an opening. Among Wayne's Westerns this one's unique; a second suitor comes along in the form of socialite Ellen Sanford (Helen Parrish). It's Ellen who catches Craig's eye, and that's fine as far as it goes, but Ellen doesn't love him, and it's never made clear why she's willing to marry him and promote his career into the political arena. The film's comic relief comes in the form of Edgar Kennedy, who we meet as he terrorizes a San Francisco bar with his entrance under the influence of a major toothache. When Craig eases Kegs McKeever's pain, he's earned a friend for life, as Kegs faithfully follows him to Sacramento. No mean feat there, as both find themselves in the river at the hands of boss Dawson's henchmen. Kegs winds up with his own share of problems as he winds up fending off an unusually horny aide to Lacey Miller, humorously portrayed by Patsy Kelley. Events seem to turn on a dime in the movie, and that may be one of it's weaknesses. For example, as Craig begins to earn the trust of Sacramento's citizens with his practice, charging fair prices and offering friendly advice, his fortunes turn abruptly when Dawson sabotages his medicines, and a town drunk dies consuming a large quantity of laudanum. Never mind that Whitey (Emmett Lynn) just barges in to the drug store and helps himself to whatever he thinks might give him a buzz. The town's citizens turn into a mob, and they're willing to hang Craig! Fortunately, they all have short attention spans, because they drop their cause as soon as a prospector hits town with news of a gold strike at Sutter's Creek. Just as quickly, they're all off to form mining camps in search of riches. The whole scene plays out so quickly that it defies credibility, but thankfully for Craig, he's alive to carry on. The turning point in the film in more ways than one is an outbreak of typhoid fever in the gold mining camps. Uncharacteristically, Lacey has a change of heart and heads for the camps to help nurse the ill. Craig's duty seems clear at this point, and that's when the hammer falls on his relationship with the selfish Ellen Sanford. When she sets down an ultimatum, it's no contest - Craig heads off to the mining camps. Boss Dawson meanwhile plans to hijack the medical supplies on their way to the camps in exchange for a share of the newly discovered gold. When he learns of his fiancée's presence there, he's ready to come to her rescue, but is gunned down by his own brother Joe (Dick Purcell), who's a bit more focused on the original mission. By now, the end is no longer in doubt. Following the trend of it's Lone Star predecessors, John Wayne winds up at the film's finish in a clinch with the bad girl turned good. But at least there was a story along the way; in virtually all of his Lone Star films John Wayne won the girl, but most of the time he wasn't even trying!",
         "The script of this Republic cheapo may be uneven (episodic and repetitious), and the casting too (Binnie Barnes looks every bit of her 40 years, and Edgar Kennedy is the very poor man's Walter Brennan), but it is always engaging, and frequently endearing. Wayne gets a chance to show his way with gentle humour as the soft-spoken, milk-drinking druggist who smiles at insults, then shows the nasty men a little trick--he can bend a coin in half--that makes them skedaddle. Though unfortunately matched with Kennedy, Patsy Kelly, the wisecracking New York comedian, shows a timing as neat as Wayne's with his trigger finger (as in all these sort of mild-hero Westerns, he is a dead shot). The comedy occasionally turns, none too smoothly, into serious, even grave, matters, with a death by poisoning, a typhoid epidemic among the gold, and the depiction of how the villains seek to profit not simply by shooting but by selling overpriced and tainted medicine. But if the film is not terribly compelling it is always enjoyable, and is not lacking in surprises, especially from the female players. All in all, though this movie suffers from the lack of money and quality control that a major studio would have provided, it also has an easygoing charm often missing from bigger and slicker films.",
         "***MILD SPOILERS*** John Wayne and Binnie Barnes light up the screen as Tom (nicknamed 'Boston') and Lacy the saloon singer in this film which is every bit as much of a romantic comedy as it is a western. They don't end up together until the end of the film, but sweet singing coyote, it's fun getting there! John Wayne has never been more dashing nor has he ever had a costar with better comic timing than Binnie Barnes. The opening scene involves a bath tub, a crowd of onlookers and a muddy street. 'Boston's' actions spark jealousy in Britt Dawson (Lacy's possessive paramour) and the fun begins. \"In Old California\" is full of witty banter and laugh out loud humor which moves it along at a brisk pace. 'Boston' picks up a sidekick named Kegs McKeever in a very funny scene involving a sore tooth. Hilarity ensues as Kegs attempts to help Boston open up a druggist shop along with fending off Helga, Lacy's housekeeper (marvelously played by Patsy Kelly) in a delightful comic turn. The main obstacle is Britt Dawson and his gang who have a stranglehold on the town of Sacramento where Boston hopes to open his shop. Add in Ellen (there's not enough sun out to warm a rattlesnake, fainting Ellen) who Boston falls in love with, crushing Lacy who does not give up easily. Let the female plotting and competition begin! The laughs are nonstop for most of the film until things take a serious turn near the end when Boston is framed for poisoning Whitey, the town drunk. The townspeople turn against Boston and want to lynch him. Boston gets out of it at the last minute, but things continue in a serious vein as gold is discovered and a plague breaks out...but never fear, \"In Old California\" has an ending worthy of a great romantic comedy. Needless to say at this point, I enjoyed this film. It is like finding a diamond in a pile of rocks. \"In Old California\" is a vastly underrated John Wayne Film from 1942. The humor in this film transcends the era of the 1800's it was made about and the era of the 1940's when it was made, and I believe this will appeal to a wide modern audience. In other words, it has aged extremely well! My hat's off to director William McGann, screenwriters Gertrude Purcell and Frances Hyland, John Wayne, Binnie Barnes, Albert Dekker, Patsy Kelly, and Edgar Kennedy for turning what could have been just another \"B\" movie into something special. I give it a 9/10 and it's one of my favorite John Wayne Movies. I hope you'll discover this little gem of a movie!",
         "One of the many gradually improving westerns Republic created for their biggest star in the early forties, \"In Old California\" was still very much in the 'B'-picture mold, but was a very entertaining tale of young Boston druggist Wayne relocating to Sacramento (echoing his real-life father's journey from Iowa to California, as a pharmacist), where his modern ideas and integrity (and the attentions from saloon girl Binnie Barnes) puts him at odds with 'town boss' Albert Dekker. While fundamentally a pacifist (Wayne diffuses potential confrontations with an ability to bend coins in his fingers!), Dekker, seeing him as a threat, decides to eliminate him by switching medicine with poison, discrediting him...but Wayne would soon have an opportunity to redeem himself... The film benefits from the comic talents of two of Hollywood's best comedians, Edgar Kennedy (master of the 'Slow Burn') and Patsy Kelly (an old pro at sarcastic wisecracks), the teasing byplay between Wayne and Barnes, and his confrontations with Dekker (one of the 1940s' best 'villains', and a perfect foil for the young 'straight-arrow' leading man). One of Wayne's more 'offbeat' oaters, but still a popular entry, during one of Wayne's busiest years!",
         "Tall and elegant pharmacist Tom Craig comes to Sacramento to open up his own drug store. On route he incurs the wrath of bully boy Britt Dawson, who doesn't take kindly to his Bostonian manners, however Dawson's girl Lacey Miller does, and along with newly acquired friend Kegs McKeever, Tom has the foundation to see his plans thru to fruition, but Dawson and his loose cannon younger brother are determined to get in the way. This is one of those films that the John Wayne haters should seek out when they use the argument that he always played the same characters. Here he is far from macho, for sure he will be forced to branch out and defend what's right, but his Tom Craig here is gentile and full of grace, very much a gentleman thank you very much. Plot wise we are treated to standard fare, good guys and bad guys just don't get on, and you just know that some pretty dames are going to have a say in proceedings. Yet this piece really has much more going for it, it's sense of fun, courtesy mainly of Edgar Kennedy and Patsy Kelly's blossoming relationship, the advancement of drugs to cure the sick and it's back drop of the Sacremento gold rush, all of it comes together to totally satisfy come the final credits. 7.5/10",
         "Boston druggist John Wayne travels to Sacramento to open a drug store. On the way he angers big-shot Albert Dekker, who attempts to blackball Wayne, only to find him partner up with his girlfriend, leading to the inevitable love-triangle, skulduggery, and showdown. One of the minor Wayne westerns cranked out by Republic Pictures in the nineteen-forties, this mild programmer is pleasant enough entertainment, though nothing really to write home about. It could have been a little better. The Duke is a bit softer than usual, in a role that's a lot different than you're used to seeing, that of an educated, suit-wearing gentleman."
