      "synopsis": "Frank White (Christopher Walken), a wealthy and powerful drug lord, is released from Sing Sing prison on parole after serving time for drug dealing charges. He is picked up by a private limousine where his two female bodyguards/mistresses are inside. They are a petite young black woman named Raye (Theresa Randle) and a tall blond former model named Melanie (Carrie Nygren). Together, they ride into Manhattan over the Queensboro Bridge. Frank insists that they first drive through his old neighborhood where he grew up in the Lower East Side and he notes just how dilapidated and depressing it now looks. Meanwhile, Emilio El Zapa (Freddy Howard), a Colombian drug dealer, enters a telephone booth outside his fancy row house to make a call, where he is almost immediately gunned-down by three black assailants. As the hit men leave, one of them drops a newspaper headline onto Zapa's lap which announces Frank White's release. Across town in a hotel near the JFK International Airport, Zapa's partner, King Tito (Ernest Abuba), sits in a room with Jimmy Jump (Laurence Fishburne) and Test Tube (Steve Buscemi), a pair of gangsters who are negotiating the purchase of several kilograms of cocaine. Finally, the two agree to pay Tito $100,000 up front, plus 10% of the street value (which includes transportation costs, Tito quips). When Tito opens the suitcase ostensibly containing the money, however, he discovers that it is full of.... tampons. When he exclaims if this is a joke, Jimmy says that it isn't and replies; \"they're for the bullet holes, bitch!\". Jimmy and Test Tube then draw pistols, shoot Tito and all his bodyguards to death, and then steal the cocaine. A few hours later, in the presidential suite at the Plaza Hotel, Frank steps out of the shower to discover that Jimmy Jump, Test Tube, and the three phone booth killers are waiting for him. They are revealed to be the core members of his gang, and they welcome him home with a gift of champagne and Zapa's briefcase full of money. After an exchange of pleasantries, Frank leaves with Raye and Melanie to meet with two of his many lawyers, Joey Dalesio (Paul Calderon) and Jennifer (Janet Julian), for dinner at a fancy local restaurant. After the dinner, during which Frank proclaims himself \"reformed\", and expresses his desire to be elected mayor, he asks Dalesio to set up a meeting with Mafia boss Arty Clay (Frank Gio). Frank and Jennifer leave to take a ride on the subway, where it is revealed that she is another one of his many mistresses. Upon being confronted by three muggers on the subway train (led by Harold Perrineau), Frank first brandishes his gun, then gives them a wad of money, telling them to ask for him at the Plaza Hotel if they want work. In Little Italy, Dalesio arrives and attempts to set up Frank's meeting with Arty Clay, but the crime lord refuses to accept. Referring to Frank as a \"nigger-lover\", Clay proceeds to urinate on Dalesio's shoes, and tells him that it's a message for his boss. Upon hearing of this, Frank, Jump, and several other members of the gang arrive at Clay's social club the following evening, where Frank tells Clay that he wants a percentage of all Clay's profits. When Clay refuses and insults him to his face, Frank draws his gun and empties it into the racist mafioso. As he makes his way out, Frank announces to Clay's henchmen that if they don't want to be continually mistreated as they currently are, they can all find employment at the Plaza. Moments later, a few of Clay's goons (including Robert LaSardo) follow Frank out of the door. The next night, after watching an avant-garde play, Frank confronts a city councilman about the city's failure to continue the funding of a hospital in a poverty-stricken area of the South Bronx. When the councilman explains that there wasn't enough money in the budget, Frank vows to fund the facility himself. Moments later, he is confronted by Detective Roy Bishop (Victor Argo) and his right-hand men, Dennis Gilley (David Caruso) and Thomas Flanigan (Wesley Snipes), three members of the NYPD's narcotics squad, who tell him that they are taking him to police headquarters for questioning. Instead, the three drive him to an abandoned lot, where they show him the dead body of Emilio El Zapa in the trunk of their car. When Frank refuses to confess to the crime, Gilley and Flanigan beat him up. The cops then drive off, leaving Frank to find his own way home. Apparently unfazed by Bishop's warnings, Frank sends Dalesio to Chinatown to make contact with Larry Wong (Joey Chin), a local Triad gang leader who possesses 100 kilograms of cocaine worth over $15 million on the street. Larry, however, is leery of dealing with Frank, especially after the killing of Arty Clay. He demands that Frank meet him alone on neutral ground to discuss the deal. As the meeting is being scheduled, however, Jimmy Jump and several of Frank's top lieutenants are arrested by Gilley and Flanigan, who reveal that one of King Tito's bodyguards is still alive and willing to testify against them. Meeting at the very hospital he is intent on saving, Frank attempts to hammer out a deal with Larry. Larry and his Triad henchmen demand $3 million up front and another $500,000 after the drugs are sold. But Frank counters that with a counter-offer. He explains that since the drugs are worth over five times that amount on the street, Frank suggests that the two team up, with Larry providing the drugs and Frank providing the dealers, and then split the profits evenly. When Frank insists that part of the profits be directed into funding the hospital, Larry turns him down and demands that Frank decide immediately whether he want to buy the drugs for $3.5 million or not at all. Frank declines and the two part ways. Returning to the Plaza Hotel, Frank learns of Jimmy Jump's arrest and orders his lawyers to arrange their release, a process that eventually entails paying $1 million in bail for each man. Frank sends his limousine to the police station to pick up Jimmy and his men, and they head directly to Chinatown, where they massacre Larry Wong and his entire gang in a quick shootout. They then find the stockpiles of Larry Wong's cocaine in large barrels marked for MSG in a basement storage. With the money gained from selling the Triad's cocaine, Frank sets up a fundraiser, hosted by singer Freddie Jackson, to raise even more money for the hospital. Witnessing this latest outrage on the TV of a nearby bar, Gilley, Flanigan, and several like-minded officers resolve to use extrajudicial means to get rid of Frank, despite Bishop's objections. Posing as drug dealers, they bribe Joey Dalesio into leading them to a small nightclub in nearby Brooklyn where Frank and most of his men are partying (among them are the three subway muggers). Catching the criminals unaware, the hit squad bursts in with guns blazing. In a huge gun battle, the dirty cops succeed in slaying both of Frank's girlfriends Raye and Melanie, as well as most of his gang. Enraged when he sees the masked assailants killing his fellow gang members while some are laying wounded on the floor, Jimmy Jump is the only one who puts up a fight, gunning down a few of the masked assailants before running out the back door where he subdues one of them and recognizes him as a cop. Fleeing in their limousine in a long car chase over the Queensboro Bridge, Frank and Jimmy trade shots with the police, killing all of them except for Gilley and Flanigan. After momentarily giving their pursuers the slip when their limo crashes into an off-ramp off the bridge, Frank and Jimmy split up, with the nearly-maniacal Jimmy staying behind to deal with the two pursing cops. Sneaking up on Flanigan, Jimmy shoots him five times in the chest, puncturing his ballistic vest with armor-piercing bullets. Seeing this, Gilley shoots Jimmy several times in the chest and, after pausing to attempt CPR on his ill-fated partner, kills his assailant with a single shot to the head. Reeling from the unexpected assault and the loss of his friend and most of his gang, Frank responds with an all-out narcoterrorism against the police. A few days after the murders, as Gilley is leaving Flanigan's funeral, Frank kills him personally with a single shotgun blast to the head in a drive-by shooting. That night, after watching his surviving henchmen kill Dalesio for ratting out to the cops, Frank shows up at Roy Bishop's apartment, telling him that he has placed a $250,000 bounty on every detective involved on the case, including Bishop. Still holding Bishop at gunpoint, Frank explains that he killed Tito, Larry, Arty Clay, Zapa and their affiliates simply because he disapproved of their business practices, which included the exploitation of immigrants and child prostitution. When Bishop asks: \"Did you really think you could get away with killing all these people?\" Frank replies with the most often-quoted line of the film: \"I never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.\" His business seemingly concluded, Frank forces Bishop to handcuff himself to a chair before taking his leave with nothing more to prove. As Frank escapes down to the subway, Bishop uses a gun from a nearby drawer to free himself and gives chase. Following Frank into a subway car, Bishop corners him, causing Frank to take a woman hostage. During the ensuing standoff, Frank fires on Bishop, killing him, but not before the policeman is able to fire off one last shot himself. Escaping from the train car and into a nearby taxi in Times Square, Frank looks down to see that he has been hit. As police officers surround the car, Frank closes his eyes and dies. The last image of the film is his gun falling limply to his side, while the police, unaware of his death, continue to keep the taxi cab surrounded, and warily begin to move in.",

         "Do you like Christopher Walken movies? The good, the deep psychological studies, the creepy pseudo-underworld /misfit characters that have unfortunately typecast one of America's greatest and multi-talented contemporary actors? Do you like Abel Ferrara movies? The down in the muck, inner-city examinations of the seedier motivations and lifestyles-the side of life many of us would like to ignore, but are intrigued by nonetheless? Low budget and a lot of conjones are trademarks of Ferrara's films (Fear City, The Addiction, The Funeral) and this is no exception, but the term stylish is defined here..You see, you hear, you FEEL the environment-the nasty low morality hustlers of the five burroughs\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085.Much congrats to Alex Tovoularis' production design. King of New York may not be as famous as Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant in the world of the cinema-geek, but maybe it should be. Joe Delia's haunting soundtrack is a perfect compliment to Bojan Bazelli's moody visuals-Walken's confrontation scene of the old-style Mafiosos is as classic as it is intense. Man, do I love this movie.",
         "King of New York (1990) was Abel Ferrara's return to the his favorite style of film making (the urban street drama). Over the past fifteen years, this movie has achieved a cult status that one would have never imagined. During it's initial release on video, this film was a word-of-mouth hit. I remembered watching this in high school. Although the movie was never a major box office hit, film found an audience when it was released on tape. But the movie's popularity grew even more when rappers made numerous of references to it in music and song. Christopher Walken stars as a crime lord who has done a stint in prison. Upon his release he begins to rebuild his fledging empire through violence and strong arming. Whilst he rotted in prison, his rivals became strong as they gobbled up his business. With time on his side, Frank launches a plan that'll make him KING OF NEW YORK. Can Frank do it by himself? How will the local authorities re-act to his new found activities? Will his soldiers remain loyal? What will his rivals do? To find out you'll just have to watch it!! I found this movie to be very good. Abel Ferrara has found his niche audience and he should cater to it. He has a style that a director like Martin Scorese once had. Highly recommended.",
         "\"From now on nothing goes down unless I'm involved. No blackjack, no dope deals, no nothing. A nickel bag gets sold in the park I want in!\" And so it goes. Walken gives the performance of his career as Frank White, The King of New York. Walken is both captivating and convincing as the drug lord with a conscience and the ice cold killer who will stop at nothing to redeem himself. Released from prison, he is now \"reformed\" and ready to once again ascend to the very top of the drug pyramid with the help of his very loyal black street crew. Hit after hit of top mob bosses in the city brings him closer to his goal of building a new hospital but unfortunately draws the attention of a demented police squad determined to put Frank outta business...permanently. To just call these cops \"dirty\" would be a disservice to dirty cops. They are also crazy and not afraid to implement their own brand of justice. The cops are p***ed off that Frank is taking over and they can't do anything about it. So the detectives plan to take Frank out themselves. They are headed by a detective who cannot control them yet wants to see Frank go so badly that he doesn't have the heart to stop them. This leads to a showdown between Frank's dangerous black Mafia and the corrupt coppers. Frank responds to their attempts to foil him by putting out contracts on the police. I heard that when this was shown at the Sundance Film Festival critics expected to see something nice and cheery about New York based on the title alone. When they saw this movie they were shocked and never invited director Abel Ferrara back. This tells me two things that (1)this is very funny and I wish I had been there to see their reactions myself and (2)most critics have absolutely NO IDEA what cinema is all about and the same goes for viewers who expect all movies to have redeeming social values, teach a moral lesson, and give them that warm fuzzy feeling inside. King of New York had a great supporting cast, skillful direction, and a solid script. And watch for Frank Gio as mob boss Arty Clay he was awesome! It is a gangster classic that never waivers in its intentions and I will be highly anticipating the long awaited prequel to this film.",
         "The ruthless underbelly of the New York criminal world is examined somewhat graphically in `King of New York,' directed by Abel Ferrara, and starring Christopher Walken. Upon release from prison, New York crime boss Frank White (Walken), determines to become a major player in the city's underworld and wastes no time in putting the wheels of his plan in motion. Among the major obstacles he encounters are King Tito (Ernest Abuba) and Larry Wong (Joey Chin), both kingpins of their respective organizations, veteran detective Roy Bishop (Victor Argo), and Dennis Gilley (David Caruso), a young, hot-headed Irish cop who seemingly single-handedly wants to take back the city from the riffraff who control it and seem somehow impervious to prosecution. None of which matters to White, who is adamant in his quest to become the King of New York. Though hard-hitting and excessively violent, Ferrara's film lacks the grittiness of say, Scorsese's `Mean Streets,' or `Taxi Driver,' but nevertheless makes an impact, due mainly to the unfettered violence, as well as the subtle, understated menace Walken brings to the role of Frank White. There's an edginess that permeates the film and the characters who bring it all to life, with the exception of White, who-- as played by Walken-- is the picture of restraint, the eye in the center of the storm. And it's that cold, soulless, almost haunted look of his that makes him so disconcerting. It's the contrast between his calm demeanor (which threatens to explode at any moment) and the overt violence with which he is surrounded, that gives him that sense of power, and it's also one of the strengths of the film. There is definitely something unsettling about Walken's presence in a role like this (and indeed with many of the characters he's portrayed in his many films); he has a natural ability and the looks-- which he uses so well to his advantage-- to convey the very essence of evil in all it's myriad forms. If they is any doubt, check him out in `Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead,' and `Sleepy Hollow,' just to mention a couple. He has the tools to make you believe his characters, and with adroit skill he uses them all, as he does here with his creation of White; and his performance is one of the highlights of the movie. Walken doesn't have the floor to himself in that regard, however, as Laurence Fishburne (billed here as `Larry') gives a memorable, high-powered performance as well, as Jump, White's main man who provides the muscle for his organization. Fishburne pulls out all the stops and laces Jump with high voltage energy that never runs out, while taking a page from the John Woo Book by brandishing pistols in both hands at once, which serves to enhance his lethal potential. And his over-the-top, in-your-face attitude is the perfect antithesis to Walken's calm, and is in it's own way just as disturbing in the aloof disregard of-- and lack of respect for-- life. I guarantee this is one pair of hoodlums you will not soon forget. The supporting cast includes Wesley Snipes (Thomas), Janet Julian (Jennifer), Giancarlo Esposito (Lance), Paul Calderon (Joey) and Steve Buscemi (Test Tube). Ferrara's film is fast paced and relentless, and he adds a nice touch to the ending that contrasts well with all that precedes it, and yet `King of New York,' even with the outstanding performances of Walken and Fishburne, never quite captures that elusive something that would've taken it above and beyond the average crime action/drama. It does have it's moments, however, and the aforementioned performances alone are worth the price of admission. Just don't come to this one expecting anything extraordinary; it's a good movie, but the Oscars will have to wait for another day. I rate this one 6/10.",
         "This is a strange movie. The IMDb trivia notes for the movie state that the director and writer spent five years working on the script, yet the story is disjointed and doesn't have a strong plot. The story basically follows the life of drug kingpin Frank White (Christopher Walken) after he is released from prison and re-enters the criminal world to reclaim his drug empire. However, there's not much character development and many of the characters are one dimensional. And the movie could be called over-stylized. Yet, somehow it all works and this movie, while not a classic, could be considered a cult classic for its great cinematography, superb acting performances, tense action sequences, its cinematic risk taking and its outright coolness. For a movie shot in the late 80's (released in 1990) its ahead of its time. Christopher Walken gives a great performance as Frank White. Many viewers who may only know Walken from his more recent appearances as \"the weird but cool guy\" will be surprised by the multifaceted performance he gives here. The late Victor Argo's performance as White's nemesis on the police force, Roy Bishop, should also be noted. Argo gives a note perfect, yet nuanced portrayal, of a weary, \"seen it all\" cop who is determined to get his man. Wesley Snipes and Laurence Fishburne were still early in their film careers while appearing in this movie, but you can clearly see the qualities that would make them stars. Both bring depth and realism to their otherwise stock characters. David Caruso also does a great job with his character. One of the shortcomings of the movie is that there's no strong female lead... Frank White has a relationship with one of his attorney's, Jennifer (Janet Julian), but the script leaves out a lot of details (e.g., why they are together in the first place). In fact, all the women in this movie look like models which only adds to the stylized unreality the movie creates. Finally, I have to mention the oldschool rap soundtrack which fits the proceedings to a \"t\". If you are a fan of crime/action movies, \"King of New York\" comes recommended, but fair warning, its not your typical gangsta flick.",
         "Abel Ferrara tries but unfortunately fails to create competition to a genre which is dominated by 'Scarface'. King of New York had the potential to be something great but in the end it only manages to frustrate you. The whole plot in itself is amazingly simple. I mean, where's the originality? A guy called Frank White (Cristopher Walken) gets out of prison, kills everybody just like that (I guess it's that easy, huh) and then he rules New York. Then some cops get angry with Frank because he's a criminal (that's the most deepest part in this movie, cops are supposed to be \"complex\" individuals...) and they decide to kill him. Then there's some shooting and more shooting and finally everybody's dead. A plot could actually be that simple if there was something extra in it - something interesting to spice things up - a great character, interesting details or ultimately anything to separate this film from the masses. Unfortunately King of New York doesn't have anything to offer in that area. They have obviously tried to deepen Walken's character but they fail miserably. In fact that's the case with all the other characters too. Walken's supposed to be this guy who cares about the poor but this is shown in what, two scenes? Same thing with the police, when they all get killed I don't feel anything because I haven't related to them. Furthermore the dialog is mediocre at best and you can't really call it original. The biggest problem of this movie is that it's not coherent at all. The scenes are in many occasions completely unattached to each other and the whole movie ends up being like a mess. The atmosphere in the film is good - Ferrara is able to depict the brutality and the overall mood well but otherwise the directing is just average. For example the opening scene is way too long. I'd understand it if the movie was an epic or a masterpiece but now it just seems completely irrelevant and tiring to spend at least five minutes following a guy who gets out of prison without dialog. Same thing with the final scene - it drags too long. I guess if you enjoyed the movie the final scene could work but for me after a messy 1,5 hours it just works as an icing in the cake what comes to frustration. I guess the main point I'm trying to say is that this movie had potential but it never delivered. The characters are paper thin thanks to awful cutting and the plot is just oversimplified. In the end this movie offers you nothing but frustration and gore.",
         "Abel Ferrara as a director has his ups and downs. In his entire career, the only masterpiece he made was \"Bad Lieutenant\". However, the rest of his films are always interesting if never completely successful. \"King of New York\" is a very offbeat crime film and will not appeal to those seeking another \"Goodfellas\". However, the film eventually won me over because of its dreamlike atmosphere. This is one of the more surreal mob films I've seen. Most of the characters are a bit one-note, but Ferrara's direction is intriguing and Walken is great as usual. The film is slowly paced which, along with the bizarreness, makes it very inaccessible. Walken turns in his most Walken performance. I'll leave that up to you as being a good thing or not, but personally I love the man. He is strange as all hell and unnerving at moments but is memorable all the same. I'm not sure if the humor was intentional, but there's something hilarious about watching Walken dancing to Schooly D surrounded by marijuana smoke. The supporting cast is one of the most bizarre ever assembled and is truly once in a lifetime. Laurence Fishburne's character is a blaxploitation throwback stereotype but easily steals the show. Victor Argo, David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, Janet Julian, and Paul Calderon are all good in their roles. \"King of New York\" is definitely not for everyone, but those interested in more offbeat and dreamlike films will enjoy it. Its more of an art film than an action film. (7/10)",
         "Abel Ferrara created a monster here and Christopher Walken grabbed it by the neck and made it one of the best gangster movies ever made. A truly faultless performance by Walken. The scene where his crew first see him after his release from prison is superb, he may try to act as one of the boys but his unnerving manner is there for all to see. Considering this film was released in 1989, the cinematography is highly impressive. The shots of Walken as he looks cold-eyed into the night are tremendous, as are many of the New York shots. This movie has a very dark feel and edge to it and I thought the score complemented this superbly. Larry Fishburne also does an excellent job as a drug-fuelled punk and the drug deal scene is one of the films many highlights. What impressed me most about this film is that not one scene is wasted. It is short, sharp, action packed and to the point and it is one of those rare gems that actually has a fantastic ending. Well done Ferrara, this movie is one of the greats.",
         "King of New York(1990) is an excellent movie that is Abel Ferrara's most stylish film. As years go by, King of New York is a film that will be more respected and seen as an example of Ferrara's best work. It was the second best gangster film in 1990 next to Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. The direction is surpurb and the characters are filled with colorful traits. King of New York(1990) is a modern reworking of the Robin Hood legend. Its basically about a former drug lord who wants to use drug money to help poor and unfortunate people. Christopher Walken gives one of his five top best performances in the role of Frank. The feature is a neo noir because there are no people except for a couple that are likable. The violence in this film is very brutal and done with plenty of flair. Frank's plans do not work out as everyone is out to get him(espically the police). Frank is a person who's alive on the outside but dead on the inside. King of New York has been compared to Scarface(1983) but I believe that this movie is closer in spirit to Ringo Lam's City on Fire(1987) and the two Chow Yun Fat/Andy Lau films of Rich & Famous(1986) and Tragic Hero(1987). Laurence Fishburne gives a very good performance as Frank's loyal right hand man. In fact, all of the action sequences involving him makes the actor the Hollywood B-movie eqevulent of Chow Yun Fat with his two gun act. Steve Buscemi has a bit part as a rival drug dealer. I only wished that the idea of putting a contract on the police was expanded on with a few scenes of many police officers being assassinated by Frank's men. One scene that is terrific is the scene where the police dressed up as drug dealers who raid and try to terminate Frank and his gang. Another excellent scene is the funeral sequence. The ending is unusually low key for a mafia flick. I would like to see a director's cut of this film released on video because I feel that something's missing from the R-rated version.",
         "Now here's a film with a mean edge....very mean....almost too mean. If I didn't like Christopher Walken (and who doesn't?) I wouldn't have watched this low- life trash. But Walken makes the trash fashionable somehow. Plus, I always like looking at great nighttime shots of New York City. A nice job of restoration was done on this latest two-disc DVD. The film finally looks good. This is stylishly filmed, too. Story-wise, as mentioned, it's very rough, lots of f-words, and a simple story of a crime boss who is released from jail and is trying to reclaim his hold on the city's mob scene. It's an interesting cast. Besides Walken is a trio of actors who wound up becoming stars: David Caruso (a TV star), Lawrence Fishburne and Wesley Snipes. All of them are nasty, too. Sometimes they make Walken look good in comparison. Unfortunately, two of those guys are cops and filmmakers love to make the cops into unlikable bad guys. They certainly are here. So, if you're feeling ornery and want to take out some hostility without hurting anyone or anything, just flip this disc in your DVD and it should be what the doctor ordered. If you can relate to any of these people in this movie, call a minister, priest, rabbi or psychiatrist. You need help."
