         "By the way this started I thought it was gonna be better than 2...maybe not better than 1 but better than 2. From the opening scene, however, it goes way downhill. Very disappointing since some of TOxie's greatest, goriest, and funniest kills are shown in the opening scene. Theat scene is seriously the ONLY gore scene in the film, except a little at the end. The rest is turned into some type of \"family\" comedy. Not for the family, but a regular comedy. Some of the jokes are funny, when Toxie is talking like a tennis player...cracks me up. But most of the jokes fall flat. It is, however, still fun to see Toxie kill the bad guys. We just want it with more gore. This film barely even has any nudity! Troma without nudity is like Easter without eggs! Come on Troma is known for their gore and nudity. Basically needed in most Troma films with some exceptions...like Kabukiman. However the other Toxic Avengers had it and it is missing. There is a n homage to the original in this one though, about his Mother-In-Law. Classic. Overall, not horrible but not great. Seen a lot of better Toxic films. Worth a watch if you are a Troma fan.",
         "I'm probably the only person that likes this installment. Even Kaufman himself doesnt care for it but I like this one. I can't really compare it to part II becuase c'mon..it's pretty much the same movie just a 2nd half. Toxie III is the 2nd half of an overlong movie that was split down the middle. It opens with an awesome scene a video store with Troma posters covering the place , some bonehead criminals pop in to cause trouble attacking the role Troma plays on consumer favorites like anything released by Warner Bros and MGM. It's also an attack on how mainstream chain video stores like Movie Gallery and Blockbuster are driving independent mom n pop video stores out which always have an awesome variety of movies..especially low budget horror on their shelves. Toxie bust in as a symbol of Troma's stance on cleaning up these corporations with some grissly death scenes..ahh how funny jump roping with intestines is. After this Toxie isnt having as much fun as he used to , he's resorted to stopping old ladies from cheating at cards..to getting kids to eat their lima beans. That annoying girlfriend Claire can get her eyes corrected with an operation..all Toxie needs is money. He signs a deal with Apoclypse Inc the corporation he ran out in Part II and gets her the operation.. And so Toxie becomes the most horrible thing of all..a yuppie. Clearly taking a stab at the Reagan era spoiled brats Toxie III has the least action in the series..in fact the entire middle is pretty lifeless until the chairman (again Rick Collins) reveals himself to be none other than the Devil himself and challenges Toxie to the Levels Of Doom. In the end..you'll just have to see it. Definitly not the best in the series..but hey..it's got it's moments see it anyway...but probably only really worth it in the Unrated Directors Cut since the R version omits most of the gore in the first half.",
         "The third TOXIC AVENGER film (aka LAST TEMPTATION OF TOXIE, 1989) by Herz/Kaufman pair is not too interesting anymore because it seems to rely more and more on the inept \"humor\" that would be found in the many other Troma films, too, but which was much more intelligent and critical in the frist TOXIC. Still the third part includes even Satan and an internal moral fight of the protagonist mutant which are welcome additions to the dramatic structure of the monster story! There are some nice and even clever camera tricks and angles (like the school bus terror) and naturally lots of ridiculous sexual situations and (some) ultra gore, but when compared to the originality and great dialogue of the first movie and the ultra wild and still pretty fresh feel of the second part, this third movie seems more and more just a money taker and not so great a (trash) movie anymore. Usually if a sequel has many segments or scenes from a previous film (usually from part one), that tells something about the obvious lack of new ideas and in addition to this sequel in question, that can also be found among others in an awful Sonny Chiba sequel to his Japanese karate flick THE STREET FIGHTER (1974), THE RETURN OF THE STREET FIGHTER (1975). These films don't have anything else in common for sure but both sequels tell the same thing.",
         "As somebody who for the first time just got to watch all of the Toxic Avenger films back to back, it is all too obvious that splitting the original 2nd film into two films was a rather big mistake. While this film does have some of the best moments in the Toxic Avenger series, the film feels flat due to the major lack of action in the film overall. There are several very good moments in the film however worth seeing. The opening videostore heist, containing what has got to be the weirdest (and funniest) cardboard cutout joke I've ever seen in my life, along with a obvious kick in the shins to what would later be known as the \"Media Cartel\" courtesy of Lloyd Kaufman. Another classic is obviously the end fight between Troma's rendition of the Ultimate Evil and Toxie. Overall, for fans of Toxie and Troma this is a mandatory viewing. However, I have to agree with Stan Lee's opening narration of Citizen Toxie when parts 2 and 3 were disowned.",
         "Toxic Avenger, part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie (1989) is basically the left overs from Toxic Avenger II. The film-makers at Troma took what was left from the first sequel and patched them together to make another film. As a quilt work film, the results are pretty satisfying. It's not horrible but on the other hand, it's no great shakes either. The film is essentially the second half of a three hour movie. If you're a huge Toxic Avenger fan, then this film's for you. Others need not apply. Lloyd Kaufman and company decided to make a couple of extra bucks when they released this movie. He should go back and edit the two together a make an epic version of this movie instead of having a movie that's basically 75 percent filler. Recommended for Troma film fans only",
         "Despite what people will say this is another great Toxic Avenger movie. Part 2 & 3 were made as one so this movie takes place right after the first. Putting Toxie in a yuppie nightmare was a very smart and funny thing to do. I loved the fact that they turned toxie back into a 90 pound weakling(although i wish they would have used Mark Torgle). The beginning was a really good! If you haven't seen this movie you might be afraid by some of the other comments on this movie but don't be. It's a great movie about the temptations of Toxie. Satan is the main bad guy!! How can you not like this movie? A toxic avenger movie with Satan as the main bad guy, what's not to like? Anyways if you haven't seen this movie please go buy it, not rent it, buy it. GO BUY The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie!",
         "TA 1 was a great movie. TA 2 and TA 3 were bad, even for fans of the Troma genre. Not enough stupid gory action and too many bad jokes and unfunny idiocy. From now on, I'm only watching TA 1 ever again. A serious let down by Troma. We need more gore, more action, more nudity, and less intentional comedy. TA 2 and TA 3 prove that it's not exactly easy to make a movie so bad it's good. Troma was trying too hard on 2 & 3 and they're just not the same as the excellent TA 1. Troma should attempt to make a serious horror movie. Their attempted comedy just isn't working. If they attempt something serious, I'm sure it will be entertaining and hilarious. Better luck to the great Troma studio. Only for hardcore Troma fans and even most of them don't like it. 3/10",
         "After a recap of the last two Toxic Avenger movies, the cartoon violence starts in a local video rental outlet, where the goons of the evil cooperation are out to take over the small mom and pop business, but Toxie puts an end to that. After much cartoon bloodshed, we flash back to when Toxie is going out of his mind because all the evil is gone from Tromaville. He has to resort to stopping old ladies from cheating at cards and making naughty kids eat their Lima beans. To compound this his girlfriend needs an operation to restore her sight. A financially strapped Toxie has to swallow his pride and go to work as an IRS man, video store worker, muffler salesman, and eventually as a spokesman for the evil Apocalypse Inc. This film manages to be worse than even Part 2, by having less action. The dumbing down of the franchise was complete. TRUE fans of Toxie would have to wait till \"Citizen Toxie\" for a good B-movie as the didn't find it with the first two sequels. My Grade: D- DVD Extras: Intro and Commentary by director Lloyd Kaufman; Second commentary by CineSchlocker, Joe Fleishaker; Interviews with Rick Collins, Ron Fazio, Gay Terry, Tracey Mann, and Joe Fleishaker; The stars of Toxic Avenger 3 on the set of Citizen Toxie; Anthology film Achrive screening footage; Naked Dance of the Damned Fat (a 2 and a halm minute putrid short); the same damn Radiation March that's on EVERY Troma DVD; a fake Troma shopping network skit; A look back at Tromadance 2000; Poster and art gallery; 'Where in the World is Toxie?' click various sites on a world map for footage from Troma's many festival visits; Theatrical trail; and trailers for \"The Toxic Avenger\", \"The Toxic Avenger 2\", \"Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV\" & \"Terror Firmer\" Easter Egg: In the 'where in the world is Toxie?' menu there's a hidden X below the Indian Ocean, click on it to find out where Lloyd Kaufman is",
         "What an unusual task it is to split a movie into two sequels. Recently this was done in adapting the final 'Harry Potter' book to film. But what if when you make a film, there's too much footage for just one? When Troma made 'The Toxic Avenger part II,' they ended up with around 4 hours of footage. To solve this dilemma, they decided to use some of it as a start for part III. Both were released the same year, but the end result was quite mixed. While II upped the ante in outrageousness, III mostly unfortunately lacks what makes it's predecessors such fun. Pros: Cast gives it their all. Exciting score. Quite good special effects. Some really amusing bits and dialogue. Still enough goods for camp lovers. Strong opening and closing. Cons: Virtually plot less. Pace drags a lot of the time. Too talky. Hasn't aged well. Could have used another trip to the editing room. Story is perhaps too straight forward this time. Final thoughts: After the zany fun of part II, this is quite a letdown. Even Lloyd Kaufman was disappointed in how it turned out. Still recommended for those who enjoyed the first two, but don't go in with high expectations. Experimental filmmaking can be a wonderful thing, but in this case it didn't really work out. Too bad. My rating: 2/5",
         "The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie begins with the revelation that Tromaville is now an almost perfect place to live & the Toxic Avenger (Ron Fazio & John Altamura splitting shifts in the rubber suit) has effectively become useless & surplus to requirements. The Toxic Avenger suffers from feelings of inadequacy, & rightly so as unemployed hideously deformed superheros don't make much money so when a letter informs his blind girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere) that an operation is available to make her see again the Toxic Avenger becomes even more depressed when he discovers the operation will cost $357,000. Determined to earn the money so Phoebe can see again the Toxic Avenger sets out to get a job, it just so happens that the evil chairman (Rick Collins) of Apocalypse Inc. wants to regain control of Tromaville & tricks the Toxic Avenger into working for him. With the Toxic Avenger on the payroll & only interested in Phoebe's operation the good citizens of Tromaville are defenceless against the might of the evil Apocalypse Inc., will the Toxic Avenger see the error of his ways in time... Produced & directed by Troma's head duo Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz this film is crap, it's as simple & straight forward as that as far as I'm concerned. I have to say straight away that I actually think the original The Toxic Avenger (1985) is one of Tromas best films & has a good blend of tastelessness, over-the-top gore, exploitation & a pretty fun story. Damn, even the not very good The Toxic Avenger, Part II (1989) is better than this, at least that had some outrageous gore & tried to be funny. The script by Kaufman & Gay Partington Terry is slow, boring, has no significant action or gore & the bad taste gags & exploitation are disappointingly kept to an absolute minimum, not that their funny anyway but it would have been nice if they had tried a little harder. The dialogue is crap, the character's are crap, the stories crap & as a whole The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie is a complete total & utter waste of 100 odd minutes of mine, your & anybody else's life who was stupid enough to watch it. I'm sorry, I just can't say anything positive about the piece of crap apart form a couple of the scenes when the Toxic Avenger becomes a yuppie are mildly amusing. I know Troma films have fans & they like them for what they are & that's absolutely fine with me, if you want to watch something like this & convince yourself that it was good because a certain studio made it then go for it, it's no skin of my nose. For anyone with any cinematic taste or judgement than I ask, no I beg you not to rent, watch or buy The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie, what if I say please as well? Directors Herz & Kaufman show their usual incompetence, they don't seem overly bothered by continuity or production values. This is as grotty & cheap as any other Troma film you care to name, in fact according to the 'Trivia' section on the IMDb this film is made up from half the footage shot (outakes maybe?) for The Toxic Avenger, Part II which quite frankly I have no problem in believing whatsoever. Some of the special effects are reasonable, there's a cool scene when the Toxic Avenger melts & one in a video shop when a thug has his hand shoved into a video player & the cogs inside crush & chop it up. There's a bit when someone has a mop handle shoved through their head & then have it twisted off, someone has some of their intestines pulled out & played with but apart from that the trademark Troma amateurish & excessive gore is sadly lacking. The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie is apparently a spoof of Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) but the title is as clever & funny as it gets. The film isn't anything to look at with rock bottom production values, a rubbishy looking devil whose 'horns' wobble & atrocious acting from all involved, yep this is definitely a Troma film. The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie is rubbish & I don't quite know how I managed to get through it, the things I put myself through so you don't have too. This is an absolute must for Troma & Toxic Avenger fans, however fans of good cinema should give this one a wide berth."
