         "This definitive version of the story of Martin Guerre (remade in English with Richard Gere and Jodie Foster as 'Sommersby'; and musicalised in a misguided version by Boublil and Schoenberg) is amongst French actor Gérard Depardieu's greatest roles. As the bluff, romantic, sensitive soldier who returns to the village after years away (or does he?) he manages to provoke all sorts of reactions from his other on-screen characters as well as the film's audience. As Bernadette de Rols, the wife seeking love and companionship, Nathalie Baye is superb; while a large and talented cast give flesh to the remaining characters. I defy anyone to see this adaptation and not be moved by it; try and see in the cinema, where it undoubtedly has more power than on a small screen; and avoid the version dubbed into English. 'Le Retour de Martin Guerre' need to survive with its language and poetry intact.",
         "After about thirteen or fourteen years I finally was able to see this film again, this time in French with subtitles, not dubbed into German. There was nothing wrong with the German version, the film certainly didn't fail to impress me so much, that I declared this film to be the best Gérard Depardieu has ever done. I think I still have the same opinion, although meanwhile it ties with Les Misérables. Now today I watched it again. I couldn't remember anything really, just parts of scenes and what happened at the end, of course. But then everything came back. The music suddenly seemed familiar, the village, the faces. I still was surprised to see Tcheky Karyo's name in the credits at the end, because I missed him completely, while I recognized Dominique Pinon at once, much younger of course. Again I stood in awe of the costumes and the village scenery. Everything was so convincing and realistic. As if someone had done a time travel and brought back a video. After The Name of the Rose this is the best period film till now. In the art department. But also certainly in acting, writing and directing. Gérard Depardieu and Nathalie Baye deliver performances which are outstanding. Every acting student should watch them, they are masters of their profession. They show emotions which are almost palpable, you feel with them, certainly towards the end, but also during the rest of the time. The script offered them \"only\" great parts and they created lives out of the printed words. Every gesture, every movement, every look fits and connects the viewer with the story. As if you're in the story, not watching it. There is no doubt whatsoever that this story is real. Even if history should have been a bit different (which I don't know), the story in the film feels real. And I just want to add that everyone who calls M. Depardieu ugly or anything like it, is not only extremely rude but obviously not receptive to any kind of charisma and aura. With actors (as with people in general, right?) looks are not important. Whoever thinks that, should switch from watching films to watching models. There he can get empty beauty. My recommendation is: watch this film. You can hardly spend an evening in a better way. 10 out of 10.",
         "This isn't a comment on the actual quality of the movie itself, but rather a response to the number of postings which have suggested this movie is not an original concept. I have some shocking news for you, but there really was a Martin Guerre. His court case in the mid-16th century is well documented in primary sources and this movie attempts to retell this story. In 1983, historian Natalie Zemon Davis, who incidentally was originally involved with the film as an historical consultant, wrote a well received micro-history on the court case and it's outcome. (The Return of Martin Guerre - published by Harvard University Press, 1983) This case was thought of as unusual even during the 16th century. So much so, that it became part of French folklore. Earlier Hollywood movies likely tapped into this folklore, when they penned similar stories. So this film, rather than simply being another in a long line of similar movies, is the first to tackle the \"original story\". That being said, the movie is not perfect and strays from the facts a great deal. Natalie Zemon Davis, herself, states in her introduction to her book that she was troubled by the film's creative license with history. Nevertheless, I recommend anyone to see this film yourself and make up your own mind. Better yet, read the book!",
         "I always enjoy watching French movies, and this one's no exception. In my opinion, this is a very beautiful movie. I love the romance, and the great performances enhance it to the maximum effect. This drama is very well made that you feel emotionally helpless on the mercy of the director. You get involved up to the point that you expect (want) things to work out like you want them to be but you really can't predict what's going to happen next. The film tells about a true 16th century story about a man Martin Guerre who comes back to his village and family after an eight-years leave to a war. Everybody's really happy that he's come back that nobody questions the changes or differences after that long eight years; until someday a vagabond says that he's not Martin Guerre. The villagers start to think the possibility that he may not be the man he claims to be. For me the film is about our judgment, our perception, our interpretation, our motive. It's about adding a human value to the rules, ethics, customs, and law that hold our society together. Sometimes what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right. In other words, sometimes we're looking for a 'humane' solution. You'll understand what I mean after you watch this movie. The casting is wonderful, especially the casting of Nathalie Baye as Martin's wife. Something in her eyes perfectly reflects her character's sad life. She's beautiful. I imagine it's going to be very hard not to sympathize with her. Just watch this movie. I hope you'll be touched and enjoy it as much as I did.",
         "One of my favorite movies, even if the ending is a heartbreaker. Every Depardieu fan should have a copy - in French, not dubbed. You can't help but like the returning Martin, as played by Depardieu. His talent at facial expression is wonderful. The courtroom scene is his best - check out the look he gives the wife as she steps forward to select the correct Martin.",
         "SPOILER!! Of course, being french makes it easier for me to understand the film. But nevertheless I'm surprised by some comments here. No, there is nothing about amnesia in this movie. On the contrary; Gerard Depardieu's memories are quite accurate, and that's the problem... Nothing in common then with The Majestic or other movies about amnesia. And no, Depardieu is not charged with the murder of the \"real\" Martin Guerre. He is charged for identity usurpation. And the \"real\" Martin Guerre shows up before the execution... Oh... I forgot... really good movie...",
         "Set in early renaissance Arriege, this movie is truly as masterpiece. Don't be put off by subtitles, just enjoy. Depardieu is superb, one of his best performances...Truly amazing! The story: Bertrande de Rolls's husband, Martin Guerre disappeared sometime ago. She remained faithful, until Arnaud du Tilh, appears and pretends to be the returning Martin Guerre. If, like me, you like both, movies and history, you must watch that masterpiece. The costumes, the settings, the decors, peasant life... all made to recreate a corner of french renaissance countryside. The story is based on facts, on real events. It's a true story, slightly changed and without the catholic-protestant antagonism. What a brilliant movie!!! Like to know more? Read Natalie Zemon Davis'\"The return of Martin Guerre\"",
         "This story is supposedly based on a true story, though the story is so fantastic it's hard to imagine that it actually occurred. The story, in brief, is that a man named Martin Guerre went off to war and was not seen for nearly a decade. When he returned, he seemed to be a nicer person--and in particular, a more attentive and less impotent husband. No one really questioned any of this until a disagreement arose between Martin and his uncle. At that point, the possibility that this was NOT Martin arose and much of the movie consists of the court trials attempting to get at the truth. Exactly what occurs I'll leave to the viewer so as not to spoil it. The acting is wonderful--particularly Gerard Depardieu. The costumes are also very good and fit the era well. And, the movie is a lot more interesting that the American remake (Sommersby) in every way. The story is awfully complex and interesting as well, but it does, at times, drag a bit--so some with shorter attention-spans and little interest in period dramas would certainly be put off by this. I loved it, but given that I am a history teacher, this isn't so surprising. An interesting tiny and unimportant mistake that my wife noticed was that the inside of the church in the film shows very very faded painting on the walls. However, when the film was to have occurred, they probably would have really been fresher--and a lot brighter. I never noticed this but she was right.",
         "OK. This is not a remake of \"carrefour\", as many may think. This is the actual story, on which carrefour was based, from 16th century France, it just happens to have been transferred to film after the other adaptation. Go read the book if you're at all interested, it's by Janet Lewis and is called \"The Wife of Martin Guerre\". The story is based on court documents among other things, and the character names in this film are those of the actual people. Don't get confused- carrefour may have been made before this film, but this is the closer adaptation and, thus, should not be labeled a remake.",
         "Brings to life intriguing and complex drama from middle ages. Brilliant acting, musical score (original instruments--well-researched), and costumes. Possibly one of the best Gerard Deperdieu films."
