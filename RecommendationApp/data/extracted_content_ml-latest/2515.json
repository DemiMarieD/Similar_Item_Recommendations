         "This movie doesn't quite have the awesome start the first one did \u0096 but I'll take a few decomposing Gatlin residents over nothing. It's the aftermath of the downfall of the creepy munchkin Isaac, the Ginger Ninja Malachi, and He Who Walks Behind the Rows. And reporters and residents from Hemingford the neighbouring town have descended upon Gatlin, with the surviving Gatlin kids being farmed off to new families so the carnage can start again. Coming to join the corn party is a teenage boy with a horrible haircut, Danny, his daddy issues and his daddy. They stay with 'attractive hostess with no real story' who has taken in a Gatlin kid called Micah, who also has daddy issues, so of course a friendship springs up between Danny and Micah that eventually leads to sacrificing people, as is the natural course of things. Nothing much really happens after that. The Gatlin kids shuffle around town in a group staring at stuff. I've decided that Micah is the best starer \u0096 he really tries at it. And blah blah blah \u0096 people start dying. I'm bored already. My favourite death (so few times you get to start a sentence that way) would be the old lady under the house, with all her howling and honking and crappy acting I was hoping one of the five year olds would just run up and start kicking her in the stomach \u0096 alas not to be, but she was crushed and the kids stood in their group and stared. Followed closely by the man who just started haemorrhaging blood all over the church. (Micah did some of his best staring in this scene \u0096 watch out for it) During this time, Danny has found love with a pretty young girl called Needy McNeederson. His daddy starts making sweet sweet love to 'attractive hostess with no real story' and there's some weird back story stuff thrown in about the corn and poisons and old Indian legends etched into rocks. None of it really makes any sense \u0096 doesn't fit in with the story in any way but it is told by a wise old American Indian man \u0096 so that lends some serious weight to what is being said. It all ends where it should \u0096 in the corn. Attempted sacrifices are abound, professions of love and apologies are made. Micah's yelling all over the place and doesn't seem to be staring as much which makes me sad. He Who Walks Behind the Rows turns up briefly and does his thing. It's just another day with the Children of the Corn. All in all, a pretty crappy sequel \u0096 but if you watch one, you gotta watch em all. Next up; Children of the Corn 3 \u0096Gangsta Corn.",
         "Although I am a horror fan I didn't enjoy the first Children of the Corn film much, so my view might be a little biased. Although having said that the movie did have its good points, the children were good actors/actresses, the violence was realistic and in moments semi chilling. Unfortunately this sequel shares none of these traits. *spoilers* The first death scene is quite surprising, I mean the guys are killed by corn, well that is dodgy. In the Stephen King short story the corn was there to serve as the vector for the children's pagan blood lust. They were killing to make it grow, though it is fantasy/horror it makes more sense than killer corn leaves that can smash through glass by simply being blown in a gust of wind believe me. Not only that but this scene reminds me so much of The Omen it's unbelievable, and what's with the Friday the 13th sound effects and Predator visuals? Hell this monster in the corn even has Return of the Jedi force powers! And what's with the old woman's demise, crushed to death by her own house? Now that is quite original, and when I was first told of this by my Cousin I pictured it vividly. Someone slowly being crushed under their own house, nobody finds the body, nobody even knows she's dead, until finally the smell of muddy hair, rotted flesh and mushed bones greet the next visitor on that hot summers morning. Maybe I was putting too much thought into this segment because yet again this is a scene ruined by cheesy references to other films. The lady goes under her house after her precious cat. When she is directly in the centre the children surround it, take the cat out and release the device raising it from the ground. The house slowly starts to come down on her and she wiggles backwards trying to escape. The children just stand there trying to look creepy, she almost gets out, why aren't they kicking her to force her to crawl back under? In the original at least the kids were violent; in this they just try to be mysterious. Well luckily for them she is too old to escape certain death and the house reaches the ground level crushing her lifeless\u0085 and leaving her legs poking out from underneath. But even that isn't enough for the cheesily poor script writers, who wrote in that her last words should be \"oh what a world!\"? seriously they need to be slapped. All realism is thrown out the window at this point, that is if you hadn't done so already what with the Journalist mentioning in a almost tribute manner \"Jones Town\" just to be controversial (or maybe its just that all American news reporters are inconsiderate slimeballs) and the \"killer predator in the corn\" bull. And how many times is the word \"corn\" used in this film anyway? Every time uttered its like a needle being drilled into my brain. Just stop already we get it. The Dr who was being nice to the children earlier on in the film gets the worst death ever, and I mean worst, luckily he gets a lolly straight after. I wish I could tell you more but unfortunately I fell asleep, well it was 5am so it could have been that, but let's put it this way I'm an insomniac. This film does have its good scenes, mainly when Danny is arguing with his dad, the teenage wit and angry demanding parent though stereotypical is realistic and at least gives the movie some sense of reality before it generates into the monomania of your average American teen horrorfest. If you're a fan of the original maybe you should ignore my small analyses, it's possible you might like this. I mean the Freddy films became a bit silly, humorous, comic book and people still enjoyed them (I know I'm one of them) But the fact of the matter is, if your looking for a serious, creepy, dark horror film then your best bet is to stay away from this horrid sequel.",
         "After the disappointing King horror film about a weird cult who worship crops comes the sequel. This has all the makings of a lame duck in classic 1990's style. The same cult that destroyed the lives of adults in the first film are \"rescued\" and adopted by a modern American housing estate town. What this means is, plenty of adults die and He Who Walks Behind The Rows is mentioned approximately once every one minute thirty seconds and frustration ensues. Surely any god is going to be embarrassed at such a crap name, but these Amish kids are not only stupid but ugly as well. Finding laughs with this film is like shooting fish in a barrel, albeit unintentional. Surely finding death amusing shows an unhealthy mind, but the victims in this must surely deserve death for their stupidity. A prime example being an elderly woman who's house is somehow propelled by a lift, who just happened to be misfortunate enough to become crushed by her own house rescuing her moggy. Or how about the wheelchair-bound granny that conveniently crashes through the window of a bingo hall at the shout of full house. The drinks are on him! Oh, how this movie has something against the pensioners. There's also some great acting by the church vicar who manages to patronise even the cult who worship the thing named He Who Walks Behind The Rows. So as you can guess COTC2 doesn't really require much intelligence to watch. It's basically a rehash of COTC, with elderly people being picked off in their dozens and lots of kids reciting Shakespeare incorrectly. 2/5",
         "The second film in the monotonous maize-based horror series takes place soon after the events of the first film, with reporter Terence Knox trying to discover what happened in the now empty town. Oddly, although every adult in sight and several children are dead, the cops disappear after a few minutes, leaving Knox free to discover bodies all over the place. It's the same mixture as before - various characters are killed by a group of spooky kids and their cornfield - with the addition of perfunctory romances and boring troubles between father and son. The film is repetitious beyond belief, seems twice as long as it really is, and as the plot revolves around Knox piecing together what we already know it's also entirely redundant.",
         "This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad script, bad acting...everything in this movie is bad. In this sequel to 1984's Children of the corn, the authorities find the bodies in Gatlin and the murderous kids responsible. The kids are all adopted by foster parents in the neighbor town next to Gatlin. But soon a boy named Micah is taken over by the evil corn deity named he who walks behind the rows. Micah gets the kids to go back to their murderous habits and soon the adults begin to die...again. I don't understand why the 1984 movie needed a sequel or sequelS I should say since there are seven of these movies. You know the original movie made 14 million dollars at the box office, so if it didn't do good why make a sequel (this movie made 6 million, a box office disaster). The only 2 good scenes were when the character Micah is possessed, he gets zapped and then he's falling through a strange shaft, gets his body dismantled, he who walks behind the rows enters his blood, and he gets pieced to together and falls out into the cornfield. And 2nd is the nosebleed scene. Take my word for it, don't see this movie.",
         "This has to be one of the worsted children of the corn movies but i have only seen number 1,2,3 and 7. Of course this film is corny because it is all about corn Thought that there were only one or two good scenes for example micah (bollman) is in Church and has a wooden doll and knife there is someone sitting across from him then micah starts putting the knife up the doll's nose and the guy across from him nose starts to bleed then micah keeps on doing it until the guy dies and the other good part is when micah dies. See They weren't that good but the were the best scenes. I would like to say Ryan Bollman is one of the worst actors so was practically everyone that was in the movie, He shouted like microphones weren't invented. This movie should not be seen",
         "I loved the first film. It's a cult classic. But like me, if anyone else loved the original film, it may take you a while to realise how absolutely dreadful this pointless sequel is. It has a nonsensical plot, no characters, dreadful acting, dreadful music, dreadful script, no scary moments. It is an abomination. The film involves the town of Gatlin being discovered, the children rescued and fostered by the adults of neighbouring town Hemingford. Then somehow, He Who Walks Behind The Rows possesses Micah \u0096 this sequel's terminally constipated-looking excuse for Isaac \u0096 and the children begin their cult again. COTC II is just plain offensive. The plot shares less in common with Stephen King than it does with a particularly violent episode of Home and Away. Lead actor Terence Knox doesn't seem to be concentrating on his acting skills, and seems to be directing every ounce of his attention to not moving a single facial muscle in his skull. Paul Scherrer on the other hand simply looks like he's on a special day out. Where the first film brilliantly explores the isolation of the victims from the rest of the world, its first sequel offers nothing more than a clueless slasher movie, with the soap opera moments hastily strung together by too-stupid-to-be-funny death sequences involving ridiculous characters that deserve everything they get. One can easily understand why Stephen King does everything in his power nowadays to disassociate himself with the Children of the Corn franchise. If this first offering is anything to go by, God only knows the stream of grime that followed in the other five sequels. You can actually simulate watching this film at no expense by sitting in front of a blank TV screen and repeatedly poking a finger in each eye for an hour and a half.",
         "The movie begins in Gatlin where it's revealed to police and the media that adults in the town are all dead at the hands of children. This film was made eight years after the first, but we are led to believe it takes place mere days after Linda Hamilton survived the vicious attack. So with all the parents dead, there are a lot of kids without anyone to look after them. To help out the kids that didn't participate in the murders, the neighbouring town of Hemingford offers to foster some of them. We are then introduced to a tabloid reporter John Garrett and his son Danny who do not get along. John is travelling to Hemingford to get a scoop on the story of the murders. They end up staying at a bed and breakfast run by who has taken in a child of Gatlin, Micah. Micah eventually becomes the leader of the resurrected corn cult and he along with a group of kids under the influence of \"he who walks behind the rows\" go onto kill adults. The gore in this sequel is piled on compared to the first. We gets slashed throats, a man who bleeds out of his nose and ears until he dies. Some pretty decent special effects for a lower budgeted horror movie. The acting is pretty good as well. Terence Knox and Paul Scherrer as father and son are good, a young Christie Clark of Days of Our Lives fame plays the heroine Lacey perfectly. And although Ryan Bollman (Micah) is no Isaac from the first film, he does a nice job as the evil cult leader. Can Micah be stopped or will he enlist Danny into his cult of adult hating young people? These Children of the Corn movies get a bad rap; but as a fan of the first one, I thought Children of the Corn II was a pretty good entry to the franchise. The plot is obviously not believable and has many holes in it, but for these kind of films I try to take reality out of the equation. The one problem I have with it is that at the end of the first one, the main characters destroyed the demon in the corn and at the start of this one, there's no explanation as to how it came to be again. We also get an interesting opinion from a few characters in this that suggest the kids are killers because the watch \"too many horror movies\". I thought that was a nice little touch. Overall a decent sequel. 6/10",
         "Although the demon was supposed to be killed in an inferno, it's back using children to slaughter adults. This film is really the only entry from the series I care for. The acting may've not been Oscar-worthy, but the characters were way more believable. Ryan Bollman did a great job of preaching warped beliefs to the kids while John Franklin made you want to laugh. The deaths were too comedic at times but the special effects were equivalent to any big-budget film. Of course, we knew from the start that John and his son would escape. Still, the film maintained some suspense and tension. Plus, we get an explanation as to why the demon harbors hatred towards adults. If you ever want to watch a Children of the Corn film, choose this one.",
         "It's been almost 10 years since Isaac and a group of kids killed there parents. Police have found out, kind of strange 10 years and no one has noticed that 50 kids have taken over a small town. One mistake. Now the kids have been shipped to Hemingford, a town 20 miles away from Gatlin, and now they have a new leader, Micah. He was almost as freaky as Isaac, all he needed was that raspy voice and him and Isaac would've been a dead tie for freaky leaders. A reporter and his rebelling son go to Hemingford to cover the story. The young son discovers the secret of the children. And it's up to him to stop them. i give Children of the Corn ** out of ****"
