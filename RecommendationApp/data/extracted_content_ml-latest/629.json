      "reviews": ["6 out of 10 Rude opens with an intense flurry of images and a near pornographic narrative that may scare away many of the films viewers. However for those brave souls who dare to stick around and look past the graphic content, they will be privaleged to a deep symbolic film. Set in Region park in toronto the film follows 3 seperate stories over the course of easter weekend. The 3 stories unfold and are connected through a underground female DJ named Rude who is broadcasting pirated radio. The film is far from flawless. Other then a few standout performances, most of the acting is unbelievable and very predictable. The storylines are not overly orginal but some important issues such as black homosexuality and the struggle to escape the ghetto are explored in a unique manner. The film can be frusterating to watch because at certain moments, it's true potential starts to shine through, however before being critical it's important to remember that this film was created on an extremely limited budget. It stands as being the first black Candian film. Overall the film has many flaws, but represents hope for the future of Canadian Cinema."],
