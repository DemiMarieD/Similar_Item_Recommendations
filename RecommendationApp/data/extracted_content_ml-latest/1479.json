         "content": "This is not really a \u201cThe Saint\u201d movie as far as I am concerned. It has very little resemblance to the Simon Templar that we got to know in the TV-series starring Roger Moore in the lead role. I have not read the books so I do not know how well the movie actually relates to the books but I have to say that I was a little disappointed to see a Simon Templar that was not really\u2026him.\r\n\r\nI have never really been a huge fan of Val Kilmer and I do not really think he is the best match for the role. But then, as I wrote, I really do not see this as a Simon Templar movie anyway so. Elisabeth Shue is totally unbelievable as a scientist. I know they had to pick someone reasonably good-looking to satisfy the script but still, she just doesn\u2019t cut it as a scientist. The Russians are giving a much better performance. I quite liked both the Tretiak characters.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say that this is a bad movie though. You just have to forget about the references to The Saint and Simon Templar. The latter is not very difficult since he really do not call himself Simon Templar in most of the movie anyway. What this movie is though is a fairly decent light entertainment about a skilled high stakes thief with a troubled childhood. I say light entertainment because the plot is really not much more than you would expect from a TV-series pilot. There are some fun action, some fun infiltration, disguises, a bit of high-tech etc. Just a mixture of some \u201cfun stuff\u201d making you go \u201cokay that was not too bad\u201d at the end of the movie.\r\n\r\nOh, one more thing, I know that Simon Templar used to drive a Volvo P1800 but quite frankly, that was the only cool car that Volvo have ever made. Since the movie was so far from what I consider to be Simon Templar it is a real bummer that they had to choose that modern Volvo crap for him to drive.",

         "I love this movie. As a movie buff, I must admit, objectively, this is a bad movie. The writing is ridiculous, the plot is convoluted, and Val Kilmer's accents are bizarre. But I love this movie. It is that wonderful combination of danger and romance that makes for great fantasy. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue holds this movie together. It is a delight to watch them realize that their skin deep attraction goes much deeper. If you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride, the Saint is a fun movie. Despite its flaws, the Saint is a guilty pleasure to indulge in when your own life is lacking in explosions, gun fights, and sudden, passionate romances.",
         "I liked this movie. Not as \"The Saint\" but as an elaborate action movie with a twist. Val Kilmer bears nothing in him that even gets close to Roger Moore's character - but if you look away from that and try to see it as an ordinary film, it's really good. First of all, Val Kilmer performs fairly well, despite his weird accents. I really liked his artist type guy who seduces Emma Russell, he was great fun. As for the story, well...I didn't bother to check for anomalies, I knew I'd find plenty. I only have two more things to say: 1. Elisabeth Shue is absolutely stunningly beautiful in this film. 2. The cool car that we only get to see a few seconds is a Volvo C70, a worthy replacement for the Volvo P1800 that Moore's Saint drove around in.",
         "The Saint starring Val Kilmer is one of my all time favourites I can watch it again and again and again! The Saint is hired by Russian gangsters to get a secret cold fusion formula from a brilliant, beautiful and young scientist played by Elisabeth Shue. Anyway he falls in love and has to outwit the dangerous gangsters. Val Kilmer plays the eccentric master thief the Saint who has a dark past and an impressive talent for disguise. All the different characters the Saint disguises himself as are memorable. I personally like heroes with a dark past who aren't perfect and have suffered to become who they are today. The chemistry on screen between Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue is excellent - and well Elisabeth Shue is beautiful! This is such a fun feel good film (although it does have dark elements to it) that gets better every time I watch it and personally I do find some characters touching especially the Saint himself who Val Kilmer plays perfectly. This film has a bit of everything - romance, comedy, drama, suspense and action and is definitely worth renting and is definitely in my collection!",
         "I thoroughly enjoyed this film and not just because of Val Kilmer's accomplishment at successfully being eye-candy, but also because of the amazing personality transformations his character goes through in front of the mirror. The story line itself is pretty impressive and I loved that although it keeps you guessing, you don't end up wondering, \"What the hell is going on?' The science side is played down enough for the audience to know it's there but not to get distracted by its details. I don't know if the theory actually works, but after watching the film I don't really care - that isn't the point of the movie. The thing that surprised me the most though was the leading female scientist, played by Elisabeth Shue. It's obvious from the start that she's going to be the 'love interest' but her characters personality always puts a question to the question, will they actually end up together. She's shy and nervous of people, but is incredibly open, honest and warmly lovable - an almost perfect contrast to Kilmer's über-suave, identity-confused, international thief-for-hire/spy. But that's the very thing that makes them ideal for each other, they might just be able to help each other with their character flaws and so you root for them both on a rather grand scale. I was vaguely baffled by the inclusion of random, suffering Russian civilians towards the latter half of the film, but considering that they were a film device to make the baddie look bad, the goodie look good and the 'common people trapped in the middle' look down right fantastic, they do their job rather well (apart from one woman who rats out our hero). All in all, they makes sure the audience are still caring if the common people are helped by the good guy, and hoping that the bad guy will eventually get his comeuppance. However, back to my original point. I still think that the film's main achievement is putting Val Kilmer in an interesting role that shows off just how good he can be; he's observant, yet unobservable; seductive, yet not a cad; confident but riddled with insecurities. Moreover, in the early stages of the film, British students are no longer misrepresented as drunken, whoring lay-abouts, but as attentive learners who actually show up for lectures. Impressive stuff. Yours Sincerely, A Proud British Student.",
         "Reading the average vote for THE SAINT disappointed me. 5.8, come on! It should at least be a 7 if not an 8! Many were disappointed because it didn't live up to the TV series. I have never seen the series so I can't really compare. Val Kilmer was just perfect for Simon Templar, and um a lot of saints. Elisabeth Shue was great for Emma Russell, as was Rade Serbedzija for Tretiak. I thought the rest of the actors were good too. I loved the plot and everything about the movie. Its a great espionage type thriller. Its a combo of Bond and Mission: Impossible. Bond gadgets, Mission: Impossible type plot. If you like those types of movies, see THE SAINT. 8/10",
         "Maybe my expectations were too low going in after reading a slue of terrible reviews, but I thought it was a good solid movie and very entertaining. Val Kilmer was great in his disguises and rolls. Elisabeth Shue was attractive as ever and played her part well. The movie kept on a continual pace, and kept the action and suspense throughout. There were a few things I thought were lame and it got a little unrealistic at times, but all in all it was a good solid movie. Maybe even a good action / romance date movie. If you haven't seen it (as I hadn't until today), give it a try. It has action, suspense, romance, and a little comedy thrown in for good measure. It runs in at just about 2 hours long, so long enough to get a good plot, some twists & turns and yet not bore you. There will always be people that pick plot holes in movies and just love proving that it's road kill. If you're one of those people, maybe you should stay away, but if you want a good entertaining popcorn movie it's worth a watch.",
         "This film upon first viewing might not bowl you over as I thought it only o.k however after watching it many times I began to see just how good a movie it really was. Firstly you have fantastic locations which I must admit generally don't draw the out the movie going public out in huge droves but do help the movie in my eyes, then you have the cast, Val kilmer makes a fantastic Simon Templer although I was'nt the biggest fan of the tv series upon which the movie is based so have no basis for comparison, which is probably a good thing as comparing actors again'st other actors who once filled the role can make the viewers decide its going to be awful before even giving it a chance.... to cut a long story short I'll say this..... good plot, great cast especially Val Kilmer pulling off the cool, dark and secretive character he portrays and last of all excellent locations all I can say is view it as a new movie and not a modern remake and see what you think.",
         "Back in the sixties Roger Moore don the persona of Simon Templar, known to his fans as The Saint. From the small tube to the Silver Screen, our hero has arisen to a modern audience. With the superb talents of Val Kilmer, the saint is out to accomplish two goals. First he attempts to secure his life-long ambition of amassing $1 billion dollars, and second to perform three miracles. In the process, he encounters both friends and life threatening villains. In this episode, the Saint attempts to save the crumbling Soviet Empire' energy supply, by revamping the scientific and long sought-after formula of Cold Fusion. In this story, he helps brainy, Dr. Lev Botvin, (Henry Goodman) perfect the celebrated formula of Physist Emma Russell, (Elisabeth Shue). The re-energized formula will replenish Russia's dwindling energy and save the Premiere of Russia from the anti-government villains played adroitly by (Rade Serbedzija), Ivan Tretiak, (Valeri Nikolayev) and Vereshagin (Michael Byrne), the archenemies of Templar. Alun Armstrong is believable as Inspector Teal. The film is fast paced and action oriented with plenty of drama, guns, explosions and international intrigue. Kilmer is fantastic and I believe this will become a classic among all the great films of his career. ****",
         "This is one of those movies that is strictly for the eye. The soundtrack by Graeme Revell was brilliant, Elizabeth Shue is absolutely stunning. In the apartment scene her eyes shine in diamond hazel colors. It was just a simply movie, decent acting, but there was something about it. It captured an essence, I can't actually describe it, it was actually corny and beautiful at the same time.",
         "The Saint starring Val Kilmer is one of the best Movies ever, and my Favorite Val Kilmer one. Also my Favorite of all time. The Film starts off with a young boy who witnesses his love die. He runs away and becomes a Thief. On a Mission to rob a rich Man, he is found out and is hired to steal from a Woman, named Emma Russell. He has to steal notes on Cold Fusion and it turns out that he gets involved with her romantically. He is forced to steal them when her life was threatened. She later find him and that is where the real adventure begins. The Saint is a great movie, for almost the entire Family. Please, take time to enjoy this Film. It's one of the best, and especially one of Val Kilmer's best."
