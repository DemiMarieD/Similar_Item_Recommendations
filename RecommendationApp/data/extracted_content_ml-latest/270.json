         "The movie started as a usual affair movie. Yet it went along straight in the middle and peaking up after it. One thing to be noted is the affection made by the music. It dominate the movie and swing our mood back and forth. And the tune Katherine Hepburn 'played' on piano really works well, with an additional song 'I Will' from the Beatles which turns out to be the movie secondary theme. The original movie has been remade before this, and many other movie uses the original 'Love Affair' as an additional magnet to it. It isn't too hard to guess where the storyline went. But the ending still caught us in deep emotion. We strongly feel love in it. Recommended for Saturday evening movie with your spouse alone.",
         "Beautiful film with great actors. Very moving, emotional and touching! Shows that everyone can change. Apparently, Beatty's life changed meeting Annette - in the film too. Katherine Hepburn is fantastic, a great actress and a great woman. Love Affair is not just about a love affair, it is a love story, a great love that changes your life, an unconditional unselfish love that puts the other first. It truly is a wonderful love story that has the moves, the light, the emotion, the music... \"I love watching you move\" - just one of the great lines that don't go away and become part of our own lines! I have watched it over and over and every single time I feel the same emotions. The scenery is also wonderful from the beautiful island shoots to central park in autumn. 10/10 easily...",
         "The 1932 \"Love Affair\" is one of the most beautiful, charming and brokenhearted love stories of the cinema industry. Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer have the perfect chemistry and it is impossible not fall in love for her. The 1957 \"An Affair to Remember\" is a remake frame by frame of the original movie and also more famous. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr also have perfect chemistry and had been my favorite romance after \"Casablanca\" until the day I saw the 1932 \"Love Affair\". I was curious to see the 1994 version of \"Love Affair\" and I found it a weak remake maybe to satisfy the ego of Warren Beatty. The introduction is awful with annoying music score and edition. Mike Gambril is a detestable character and I do not see any reason for Terry falling in love with him. It is only good to see Ms. Katharine Hepburn in her last feature. My vote is five. Title (Brazil): \"Segredos do Coração\" (\"Secrets of the Heart\")",
         "If you haven't seen the Beatty/Bening remake of An Affair to Remember - don't! This review is for readers who have seen the original and know the basic premise. I was drawn to the movie because of Bening - I enjoy her other films, but this one is a mockery of her talent! The on-screen chemistry between her and Warren just isn't there. The taboo of engaged couples \"cheating\" on one another is stale and the premise that Bening selflessly gets on with her life after her accident is implausible in today's world. The chance that Beatty would have a little auntie (even if that auntie is Katherine Hepburn) living on a tropical island that just happens to be close to where the plane he was flying in makes an emergency landing, is too much of a coincidence even for a fairy tale. This movie is beyond real! The jazz vocal narrative is annoying and out of place. As for the tear jerker ending, Warren can't even come close to replicating the look on Cary Grant's face when he realizes the devastating truth about Deborah Kerr. Oh what I'd give for a really good love story!",
         "It was very difficult to decide how to rate this movie. I'd not seen the Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr version (except for the little snippets that appear in \"Sleepless in Seattle\"), so my opinion was not colored by the inevitable comparisons... It's just that the first half of the movie struck me as being incredibly *bad* : it was poorly written in particular. Once Katherine Hepburn appeared on the scene, the film began to improve quite noticeably, and the last half was considerably better, with superb performances, especially from the two principals. I've never been a big Warren Beatty fan, but Annette Bening is WONDERFUL! (I think I've fallen in love!!!) -- To sum up, the first half of the movie rates a 3 in my book, the second half an 8 -- hence my overall grade of 5.",
         "Why did Beatty and Bening decide to do a remake of one of the most romantic films of all time? They should have left it alone. There is little chemistry between them (despite the fact they are married in real life). No dramatic tension, no nothing. Katherine Hepburn, in a brief appearance, is the only bright spark in the whole thing.",
         "Without her this movie would be maybe something to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon when there's not much on cable. But K Hepburn takes this film from \"ok\" to \"something worth spending spending time watching.\" Even at her age the strength of her character and acting ability brought the few sparks there were into this film. But I've always considered Warren & Annette a perfect match...bland...bland...and more bland. Do they have a personality?? I truly don't understand how they got to where they are today, but I could say the very same thing about some of our re-electeds. If you want to watch a much better version of the story with an entirely different sphere of acting check out the 1957 version \"An Affair to Remember\" with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Some scenes are a little outdated, but the acting and chemistry between these two make it timeless. They've made their characters seem so real, they almost jump out of the screen. Then it all comes to a head in this heartbreakingly emotional ending, a story of selfless love, I cry every time. Annette & Warren simply don't have the acting ability or charisma to give these characters that certain kind of trueness in which you would feel any great emotional investment. They strike me as very into themselves sort of selfish people anyway, could they truly characterize selflessness?",
         "People that know the 2 movies \"An Affair To Remember\" and the re-make before this one also called \"Love Affair\",pretty much know what the movie is about and what to expect. After viewing it all, I can honestly say that this re-make was not really necessary. I'm not saying it suffers the same fate of Striesand's remake of \"A Star Is Born\" (also a third go-round) but for all intentional purposes,it's just okay and a bit bland. I know Beatty is a good actor and so is Annette but there's not a whole lot of dramatic feeling in their parts for my taste. Even after her character is hurt and can't walk,you just don't feel that sense of urgency about these two. Which makes it very hard to care what happens to them. I was far more moved by Aunt Ginny's passing than anything else. Speaking of her : Like many have stated here though,Katharine Hepburn's brief appearance more than makes up for it. Her part really should have been written so she could at least have been in the film for an hour. I also wish she hadn't been made to use a certain 4 letter word also,totally unnecessary and cheap low brow humor. In all,it's okay to watch if you've nothing better in your collection or to rent, It is worth it for Hepburn,as is almost anything Hepburn ever made. Six stars,for simply a watchable enough film and of course,because it was Kate's last theatrical movie-screen appearance. She was always the bright spot in any film,good or bad. (END)",
         "I've often heard how so many people, mostly women love the movie \"An Affair To Remember,\" and yet, I never cared much for it. I like the actors, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, but the storyline and the idea of \"an affair\" didn't really appeal to me. I also didn't realize that it was a remake of \"Love Affair\" from 1939 starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. I happened to see piece of it on a cruise ship and my husband and I recognized some of the dialog. And we both remember the reference to the movie in \"Sleepless In Seattle.\" It was interesting to see this and I decided to borrow it from the library to watch and after watching it, I still didn't find \"An Affair To Remember\" very appealing. At the same time, I noticed the movie \"Love Affair\" with Warren Beatty and Annette Benning. I'm not really fans of either, but, for some reason, this movie caught my attention. It's possible it has appeal because here is an actor who was once known as a lifetime bachelor who has now married to an actress and raised four children and the chemistry with the woman he chose to spend his life with shows through. The music throughout the movie is beautiful and the main storyline follows its predecessor, but the dialog is fresh. I was glad to see that the \"sensationalism\" promoted by paparazzi is quelled by the quick wit of Mike Gambril paying a crew member to present a telegram to the photographer to send him on a wild chase preventing the \"scandal\" as in \"An Affair To Remember.\" This movie gave me reason to like the story. I find that, even if I am not a fan of particular actors, I can enjoy a movie if they put their heart and souls into the project and not worry about impressing the viewers.",
         "Whenever I want to watch a film in which Warren Beatty's name appears,I know that there must be a damn good reason that has made him contribute to this film. He doesn't have that many films,and there is hardly a film of his that doesn't have a strong statement to make. When I sat down to watch \"Love Affair\",I didn't know that it was a re-make of the 1939's \"Love Affair\" and 1957's \"An Affair to Remember\". I was so marveled with the boyish charm of Warren Beatty when he was trying to hook up the main female character of the film,his real life wife,Annette Bening as Terry McKay,and it was after Mike(Warren's character)and Terry's visit to his aunt,superbly portrayed by Katharine Hepburn,that I noticed the similarities. By the sheer appearance of Hepburn as Mike's aunt on the scene,even before she had noticed the arrival of her nephew,when she was chatting with the docks,she established her presence so rapidly and strongly that made me forget about the other characters. However strong was Hepburn's performance,how much it overshadowed the performance of Beatty and Bening,it was justified.One could sense their admiration towards her, not only as the characters of the film,but as co-workers as well. And that's exactly what gives truthfulness to the point of documentary,to this scene. When Beatty was listening and watching the two women perform the song ,it was obvious that it was not just Mike looking at his aunt,but also Warren Beatty,stoned in awe of the sensitivity and artistry of a Legend. The same goes for Annette Benning.In her conversations with the aunt, and while she was accompanying her by humming,while she was playing the piano,it was again Annette Bening dazzled by her aura. At that point, both us,the viewers,and Beatty and Bening became one,we all were viewers. They were all swans,both the couple dressed in white and in total peace and harmony with themselves and the nature,and the old and wise aunt,Katharine Hepburn,making her unforgettable performance as her swan song. If there is a reason for this film to exist, is that scene. The scenes following their arrival in New York do not have the saying and drive of the first half of the film. Even the scene with Ray Charles which is the living proof of the victory of love and dedication over any misfortune,is not able to prevent the spectator from feeling sorry for the lovers,instead of celebrating their re-union. The scene with the aunt was so honest, so profound,that I was expecting something new,something breathtaking as that scene itself.And I kept telling to myself that this is a Warren Beatty film,it is eventually going to take another turn, unravel another aspect of the story,it isn't going to end like that.But to my surprise it did. The \"Love Affair\" which began in the sky ended on a not strong enough land. But it made us the witnesses of one of cinema's most cherishable moments,the getting together of the guru and her apostles."

         "Not a particular fan of \"date movies\" but this is a gem. It's a slightly modified version of two priors both very good for this genre. The plot has already been outlined, we know they meet and agree to meet later but only one shows up. The quirks that keep these two from reuniting tugs at all of us viewers who just know they are made for each other but somehow cannot seem to re-connect. It's a dramatic finish to be sure. Grab some paper towels and enjoy one of the better romantic movies of all time."
