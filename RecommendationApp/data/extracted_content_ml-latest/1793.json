         "I saw \"Welcome to Woop Woop\" a couple of weeks ago on HBO, on the recommendation of my American neighbour. He loved it! And he's right. I watched this film grinning from ear to ear, and if it were not for my neighbour's enjoying it so much, I'd have thought that only Australians would get the drift of this film. \"Welcome to Woop Woop\" is resplendent with Australian iconography, and if you don't know the space you may have a hard time understanding the references. As an Australian, I can tell you those references are spot on! The language, being out in the bush, the actors Rod Taylor and Barry Humphries (Dame Edna) and so many others, the stereotypical Aborigine. Cockatoos, dunnies(outhouses), the VW van, the backyard tip (dump), the brand of beer (it's real), Rogers and Hammerstein films, kangaroos as Aboriginal spirits, kangaroos as dog meat (true, not good, but true), even the main character's dog ( a Blue Heeler, Australian Cattle Dog), and the reference to the beach. They have nailed this film. 10 stars!",
         "This is a film classic, in the mode of 'There's something about Mary'. Rod Taylor gives the performance of a lifetime. The ethereal counterpoint provided by the Rogers and Hammerstein scores is strange and wonderful at the same time. It's a comedy, a very dark comedy. It's a love story ... F#*($K me blue, F*@#(K me raw, to the strains of The Sound of Music. It's great entertainment. It's Deliverance meets Rogers and Hammerstein. It's Sex and Drugs, and Broadway show tunes in the Australian outback. A combination your not likely to have sampled before, but one you will wish there was a sequel for. If TV sitcoms are your thing, you just won't get this film. It's bizarre, shocking (if you shock easily), wildly funny, and atmospheric. Is there something about this film that is uniquely Australian? Probably not, this had to have been a bizarre and disturbing dream, or a psychotic episode scripted. It's great entertainment, and certainly an escape from reality. It's a 10",
         "Welcome to Woop Woop amounts to a farce with a very unique (and appalling) storyline. The town Woop Woop is literally 'off the map' and its inhabitants interact in a surreal and disturbing fashion. Fleeing from danger in New York, the lead character (Johnathon Schaech) makes it to Australia, only to walk into a much bleaker situation \u0096 a kind of time-warp - where Daddy-O is the law, the judge, and the executioner. Rule number one: no-one escapes from Woop Woop. Unfairly criticized as vulgar and offensive, many have missed what this film is all about. Properly understood, however, this makes for highly entertaining (if somewhat foreboding) viewing. Great stuff!",
         "How can you give a bad rating to this film? This movie rocks. It is so unique and different. Just imagine that you are a grifter that a mobster is trying to kill. Oh yeah, you catch and sell cocateaus (I think that is how you spell it). So you decide to run off to Australia (you can catch some of those birds there). However, while you are in Australia you end up having sex with a lovely lady, who drugs you and marries you while you are passed out. Then she takes you to live on a compound deep in the outback that is run by her charismatic and psychotic father. Played incredibly by Rod Taylor. OK that is enough, you have to watch the rest and you will be happy that you did. This movie is eye and ear candy!",
         "I just saw the movie (between 1.40 and 3.10 a.m.) as it was broad casted on Dutch television (SBS6). Weird, entertaining, funny and quite philosophic; especially at this hour of the night ;-). I was very surprised to find only really BAD reviews of Woop Woop at the internet. It seems my choice in movies/books etc is not the mass-opinion. This Monday I'm buying it, it's at least number 6 in my 'all time favourites' list :-) 'The usual suspects' & 'Lost boys' are some other examples of great movies (I think) and those are (in average) really well reviewed, so it's not that I only like weird ones. Go see Woop Woop! It's fun ;-)",
         "Director Stephan Elliott had a big hit with \"Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" back in 1994. This is his 1997 followup which was a huge bomb. I like it, but it's easy to see why it failed. A con man (Jonathan Schaech) travels to Australia to kidnap some rare exotic birds (don't ask). He is unexpectedly sexually attacked by a VERY aggressive young woman, and she knocks him out, drugs him and takes him to her hometown, Woop Woop, and proclaims he's her husband. Woop Woop is in the middle of nowhere, has a population of 50 and is definetely a strange place--Rodgers + Hammerstein songs are blasting from speakers all day (!!!), they kill kangaroos and make them into dog food and no one is ever allowed to leave the town. Schaech wants out...but can he make it? To say this movie is bizarre is an understatement--it's VERY weird! Everyone overacts to the extreme (especially Schaech) and wear very weird, colorful costumes (I mean that in a good way). The script goes rambling all over the place, most lines make no sense and then there's the non-stop R&H songs! Still, it is very funny (if a little sick at times) and you can't take your eyes away from it. The acting is, as I said, over the top but great. Schaech gets right in the mood of things from the beginning--he's very lighthearted, grinning continuously and gives his all to his lines. He's also handsome and hunky and has a few nude scenes. Also Rod Taylor chews the scenery again, and again, and again, and AGAIN as Daddy-O--the leader of the town. It does lag a little at the end and it's definetely not for all tastes but totally off-beat and fun--particularly the opening in NYC and the last scene with...well, you'll know! A must-see for R&H fans.",
         "I tell you folks, that was THE FUNNIEST line of irreverent dialogue I've ever heard! Seriously, I can somewhat understand why Aussies who have reviewed this very smart, funny and VERY whacky film are besides themselves over the stereotypes and how some of their brethren are depicted here. Now, yet another group of people understands and feels what minorities everywhere feel when the same type of satire is done to them, but to an extreme! But, hey! Loosen up a bit-just let that \"Breezer\" rip! It's all good! I exchange emails with several Aussie folks Down There regularly, and they seem to talk and act very much as I do. So I can watch this film knowing that what I see is \"over the top\" in it's characterization, and NOT indicative of all Australians. Every ethnic group has it's \"lower elements\" for sure. But, I'm sorry, this was some hilarious stuff! All these characters were two sandwiches shy of a picnic! I've always been a Rod Taylor fan, and he steals this flick wholeheartedly. That guy is still one of the finest actors still working, and I know he's up there in age now. These folks live in a world far removed from reality. The remarks (\"beef curtains\", etc) are fresh (most of us here in the US have NEVER heard these expressions) and the whole town gathering nightly for 'Rogers & Hammerstein' movies (and a LOT of beer guzzeling) as the high point of another dreary day reminded me of the Wizard Of Oz's munchkins singing. Yup, sure enough, the plot had some holes for sure, but otherwise, the performances were great, from Johnathan Saaech on down. I flat out loved this film. It was quite a pleasant surprise and yes, I agree it has cult status written ALL over it! See it for a monster laugh! I'll be willing to bet it caused quite an uproar when released!",
         "This film is hard to describe. It starts in New York City and then finds itself in the Australian Outback. This guy who sells illegal exotic birds is on the run. He heads to Australia to hide and get more birds. He is then lured by a vixen into a community of Aussie dog-food makers that live alone in the outback. They watch old musicals and are as dirty as garbage. Oh yeah, nobody is allowed to leave the community, known as Woop Woop. To be honest, this is one of the freshest and most enjoyable movies I can ever remember seeing. Loved it! And yes, that is Rod Taylor!! *** out of ****.",
         "This movie isn't for everybody. But as weird as it is, it is fun, and acted with gusto, especially by Susie Porter.",
         "This is a fun little peculiar film! A dime-store hood named Teddy (Johnathon Schaech) from NYC, flees the mob and a psychotic, gun-toting, stripper girlfriend for Austrailia; while crossing the Outback, he meets and seduced by Angie, who knocks him out, drugs him, and brings him to her Outback hometown (\"Woop-Woop\") of 50 strange friends and relatives. Woop-Woop is a town filled with crazies, hippies, and grandparents (folks long forgotten by society when their asbestos mine is closed). The locals never leave: they package dog-food made from Kangaroos for a living, and entertain themselves with Rodgers & Hammerstein soundtracks, and a nightly viewings of classic Hollywood musicals. The \"King\" of Woop-Woop is Angie's Dad (Rod Taylor... Yes, THAT Rod Taylor). Teddy isn't ready to settle down in Woop-Woop, and quickly begins to challenge Daddio (Rod Taylor). It's a peculiar film, full of colorful characters, full of subtle detail. I've seen this film over and over and always find something new with each viewing. Three special bonuses: (1) a cameo by TV's Tina Louise, (2) ultra-handsome Johnathon Schaech in various stages of dress & undress (!!), and (3) an innocent film-clip and line of dialogue from the classic film, The Sound Of Music, that will never sound innocent to you again... It isn't really dirty, but when a Nun says it, I promise you'll giggle like a 4th grader!! You'll never look at Julie Andrews the same way again! Welcome to Woop-Woop... You'll be glad you came!"
