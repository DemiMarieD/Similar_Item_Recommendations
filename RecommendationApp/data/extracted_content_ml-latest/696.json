It's bad luck for the women at the cash desk not to be Judith, because Eunice is eccentric, angry and extreme dangerous. One day she meets Miriam, hard of hearing and a little ingenuous, who feels sympathy for Eunice and takes her home. Miriam is very impressed by Eunice's fierceness and willfulness and follows her on the search for Judith. Shocked by Eunice's cruelty she tries to make her a better person, but she looses ground herself.",

         "What prompted me to write this was reading another viewer review that claimed this film was terrible. Now, I am not going to attack that reviewer; everyone is entitled to their own opinion and all that, but I am going to tell you why I disagree with what that person wrote. Eunice and Miriam are the central characters. Known to each other as Eu and Mi, (You and Me). Eunice feels God has forgotten her, so makes has to punish herself or her sins and crimes. Miriam is a sweet, sensitive girl, a complete opposite to Eu. At opposite ends of whatever the scale might have been, Eu and Mi cross the country so Eu can find the only person she has ever loved... It is a shocking tale. It is disturbing, depressing. It is, for me more of a tragedy that Hamlet and Macbeth put together and multiplied a hundred times. Love and Redemption. Love. Love. Love. That's what it's all about. The final scene of any film should be something. I have never cried so hard in a film as I have in this one. Everybody who considers themself a fan of the 'non-Hollywood' style film with heart and guts, then see this incredible film! 10/10",
         "If you generally don't like murder films you'll hate this movie, never mind the fact that it's actually very good. Very little heed (if any) is paid to the numerous victims, their bodies falling to the side of the storyline as the obsessed female lovers move on, taking the plot with them. Butterfly Kiss introduces two startlingly distinctive, unique women, opposites drawn together by loneliness and a need for balance. Eunice is a dispairing, tortured soul who searches the bland, grey motorways of England for the ever-absent Judith (does this abstract individual really exist or is she another figment of Eunice's amazingly complex and unstable psyche?). People who turn out not to be Judith tend to end up the victim of Eu's homocidal wrath (note though that Judiths importance to Eu was going to end up in mortal sacrifice also). Eunice has no inhibitions, no scruples; her behaviour is repulsive, obnoxious, sexually promiscuous, extravagantly moody. She acts purely on impulse and instinct, rarely using her devastated mind, for Eunice actually wants to be caught, and wants to be punished. In fact, she consistantly pushes her luck in aggravating people, beleiving God (and I guess the rest of the world) has forgotten her. Consequently she is forced to punish herself, wrapping her scrawny body in chains that hurt and bruise her. It is quite possible that a lot of her other actions throughout the film, which are illogical and cruel up front, are more attempts by Eu at self-punishment though that is left for the audience to mull over. Miriam, by contrast, is water to Eu's fire, a metaphor even she explains in her black and white interveiws dotted throughout the film, as she tells their story to a camera. Miriam at first looks to be dim, naive, childish and ineloquent in her speech. Reading between the lines this version of Mi fails to convince, instead giving the image of perceptive, open-minded in the extreme, generous and angelicly kind. Whether this was supposed to be Mi or was Saskia Reeves' true intelligence mistakenly worming its way to the surface is unknown, and it doesnt really matter -the character was nontheless, adorable. As lonely and love-starved as Eunice, their similarities end there. Mi is totally honest and forthcoming; her love for Eunice is complete and unconditional. Along with being painfully direct, Eunice is also implicitly dishonest. When Miriam discovers Eu's homocidal nature she is already in love. She disposes of the body without encouragment from Eu and sets out to support Eu and make her a better person. Rather she becomes a murderer herself, though through more subtle indications she retains all the original beauty and kindness of her placid personality. People who may dislike this movie are being subjectively incorrect in saying that it isn't good. Truly it is not a pleasant film to watch but it is still a worthwhile peice of artistry riddled with talent.",
         "Amanda Plummer ravages through this film like a wounded hyena starving for what may be it's last meal come flood or high water. She may be Hollywoods best actress, but does she give a crap. I thinks not. Hollywood gives Oscars for cute models who show a talent for walking talking and chewing gum all at he same time. And if she can make herself ugly for a role, Hollywood seems astounded at her courage. Plummer can not only chew these little girls into so many wads of Jamaican licorice stick, but in this role as Eunice, she makes Robert DeNiro look like a neutered cub scout. This is as powerful a performance as you'll see. And on top of that her English accent is superb. There aren't any other actresses in Hollywood that could play this role. Maybe Renee Zellweger could come close. But I doubt she'd have the guts to do it. This is a very disturbing film. But a performance like this would make even the great Kim Stanley cringe.",
         "I found \"Butterfly Kiss\" to be mesmerizing, horribly sad, and strangely energizing. Twisted is the right word for it, but there was more to it than two crazies running around killing people. The bond between Mi and Eu that was cemented so quickly after them having met each other is the most fascinating facet of the whole story. What Mi gives up for Eu is heartbreaking and amazing.",
         "Spoilers herein. I think a lot of Winterbottom, though he makes me work hard at it. Superficially, his films are simple arcs inhabited by his tone and the actors' spontaneity. In this case, we have what is almost a genre. Whenever I see \"character study\" I cringe. And this has that veneer: something between \"Fun\" and \"Invisible Man.\" But just a simple scratch deeper gives something more worthwhile. \"You\" (Eunice) and \"Mi\" (Miriam) are the same person, recounted by \"healed\" Miriam, who takes a completely different actor's stance in the narration sections. Eunice: promiscuous, chained, selfabusive, mercurial. Miriam: deaf, virginal, meek. The situations are dreamlike: lots of repetition with the entry into the petrol store. Always the same first lines. Dreamlike consequences: no matter where they go or what they do, the world swirls around them like a disengaged movie. The butterfly is two wings on a single body. Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",
         "One of the most memorable movies I've ever had the fortunate experience of picking up at a video rental store. It exposed me to one of the best actresses of the 20th., and now 21st. Century: Amanda Plummer. My praise of this film does not finish with Ms.Plummer's believable portrayal of this intense, psychotic young woman. Being an ex-patriot (as they say), I could even smell the petrol (gasoline) fumes. I felt as though I were 'Up North'. It's not a pretty picture! It's certainly not one to be missed by any serious film (noir) lover. You might also check out 'Heavenly Creatures' 1994.",
         "You can say what ever you want on this movie, but amanda plummer stays the best actress on the planet. If you would meet her in the street she could make you believe that she has been like that all her life, because she lives in a role like i have seen nobody else do. By the way this isn't an easy role to play. Further it must be said that micheal winterbottom isn't one of the worst directors around either, as far as i know i haven't seen anything of him less than excellent. This movie was so good that i cried at the end",
         "WHAT CAN I WRITE NOW ABOUT THIS PERFECT FILM? CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CREATORS FIRST OF ALL! Really i wonder if any person that saw this film could possibly say that he didn't like it! it's an amazing film, full of love, despair, tenderness and finally salvation. the end of the film is the most \"strong\" ,affecting, redemptory, gorgeous ending of all times! a great movie!!!! with great music also!.......... there's no need to argue anymore.......",
         "Amanda Plummer continues her tradition of oddball and perfectly drawn characters in Butterfly Kiss. In fact, her extended cameo in Pulp Fiction comes across as somewhat well balanced in contrast to her portrayal of this dented and damaged road weary dominatrix in search of a soulmate on one of Britain's anonymous northern roads. Thelma and Louise? Well, yes, I suppose, but Butterfly Kiss has more in common with John Huston's little known masterpiece Wise Blood than with Ridley Scott's dust-borne epic of the great American Southwest. There are two women in both movies--but Little Women is not Thelma and Louise cubed. There are some beautiful loose ends in this one. Why is Plummer's character the way she is? Where's she been? How did this come about? Adding to that is the fact that the accents are thick as steel padlocks and what you should have is a confusing mess. Instead, Plummer pulls this off with such aplomb that you don't care about any of that. What's she going to do next? That's the real question in Butterfly Kiss, and you'll hang on just to find out. I loved this. Rent it for a couple of days because you'll want to see it a couple of times before you're done with it.",
         "The thing that first struck me was seeing Amanda Plummer playing in an English movie. A nice surprise. She really has some great acting skills. After seeing Pulp Fiction I automatically assumed she was an American actress. Looking at BK however, gave me the strong idea that she had to be British, speaking with such an explicit Northern English accent.... IMDB learned me that she is American after all. Tops!! Of course her role is a very bizarre one: a man-hating lesbian who seems to kill others at random. She takes Saskia Reeves with her in a negative downstream which finally results in an ending that can't give a good feeling to anyone seeing the movie. In spite of that (after having some doubt) I found that I truly liked this movie. Thanks to those two fabulous playing actresses (I'd never seen Saskia Reeves before but I liked her right away. Not thanks to the story: I never found out what the rue reason was behind all the killings. 7 out of 10."
