Eckstrom crews the ship with his brilliant proteg√© Dr. Lisa Van Horn (Osa Massen), Astronomer Harry Chamberlain (Hugh O'Brien), and engineer Major William Corrigan (Noah Beery Jr.) under pilot Captain Floyd Graham (Lloyd Bridges). After a succesful launch, the mission goes awry, as the crew are hurled across space and past the moon by a rocket malfunction, to land instead on the planet Mars. Encouraged to explore by Eckstrom, they find the remains of a human civilization destroyed by nuclear warfare. They are soon attacked by a band of savage, mutated humans, and Corrigan and Eckstrom are killed. The survivors escape back into space, but Dr. Van Horn discovers that not enough fuel remains for a safe landing. She and Graham contact Fleming to pass on what they have learned, and share their first and last few tender moments together, before their ship crashes to Earth. Grief-stricken, and stung by suggestions that the mission was a failure, a sombre Fleming proudly announces the imminent construction of RX-M2...",

         "This is one I've carried in my memory for years. Without the Technicolor budget of George Pal and Robert Heinlein's \"Destination Moon,\" \"Rocketship X-M\" succeeds in becoming a far more meaningful and memorable pre-\"2001\" science fiction film. \"Destination Moon\" attempts a \"scientific\" preview of man's first lunar visit. Of course, this effort seriously dates the movie (I also smile at the rather whimsical, seat-of-the-pants, \"outsider\" endeavors of our heros as they manfully put forth, launching their rocket one-step ahead of the narrow-minded \"authorities.\" Okay, so much for that!). Rocketship X-M had to vie with \"D.M.\" for entertainment bucks at the box office. X-M's b&w budget (with special effects courtesy of White Sands V-2 stock footage and model-making of the string and cardboard variety) didn't allow the producers to throw a lot of \"science\" at us, however. What they did have going for them, however, were a few excellent character actors doing star-turns for a change of career-pace, a script by Dalton Trumbo, music by Ferde Grofe, and excellent -- and evocative -- sound and camera work...etc. Granted: The film's overall messages are a bit simplistic -- nuclear war is bad and should be avoided and the human spirit for exploration and discovery cannot be put down by failure and difficulty (I guess they never considered budget shortfalls as a \"failure of spirit\"). These ideas are, at least, given voice here during what was, after all, a dangerous era in American politics. Remember, Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted! The science? Okay, it sucks. Who cares!? Science fiction, to my liking, is less about science and numbers than it is about people and life. This has all of that and carries it forward with distinction and class. When I first saw this movie as a kid, I remember being truly frightened by the bleak view of a post-apocalyptic Mars and shivered in disbelief then terror at the onrushing tragedy of the about-to-crash rocket bearing the two doomed lovers and their sole-surviving crew-mate (a young Hugh O'Brien) to a fiery demise over the Ural Mountains. The producers did a terrific job with what they had and they deserve a great deal of credit.",
         "Rocketship X-M should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons: 1) It is one the first -- and the few -- movies not to have a happy ending. Doubtless the effect was more profound in post-World War II America than it would be today, but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film's message. 2) It is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion, using space as a valid setting for drama. The lack of scientific background notwithstanding, the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare. It's not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space. 3) The anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers, men, or animal. The effect of Martian society from nuclear devastation is starkly and frankly presented. The fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on Mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending. Sterno says take a ride on Rocketship X-M.",
         "I recently picked up the DVD of this film for a look. I originally saw it in 1951 when it got to my town on the bottom of a double bill with the western of the day. At that young age, the screaming cave-girl was my most vivid memory, but I liked it. Also saw it maybe 20 years ago on VHS. Still pretty good. Lloyd Bridges was cool, underplayed the whole part. On this last viewing, it's still a good sci-fi flick but from a vastly different point of view. The science as since provided by the real rockets that have been put into space was fairly on the money, especially the two-stage rocket explanation. Since special effects are practically nil, the look is O.K. The fiction, on the other hand was way, way out there. Please note, that all instruments were manual and mechanical and calculations were done with pencil and paper. Not a digital instrument or computer in sight. The idea of doing the Mars locations in Sepia-tone was as brilliant as it was cheap, as well. Lloyd Bridges and Morris Ankrum were head and shoulders the most talented actors in the cast of otherwise good players. Ankrum especially ,always under-rated, could read a grocery list and make it sound important. It also didn't hurt that Kurt Neuman put the whole thing together, either. This film probably inspired in it's own way a lot of young people to explore science and space exploration for real.",
         "Some films are blessed (though the producers would argue) by having less money with which to work. \"Rocketship X-M\" (the initials represent \"eXpedition Moon\") relies therefore upon, ahem, a real Story, with Acting, rather than flash and effects. That's why a half-century later, the well-remembered \"RX-M\" has held up so well. (An analogy could be drawn with the co-incidental 1949-1955 television series \"Captain Video and His Video Rangers\", where the bulk of budget also went towards quality writers and cast.) John Emery is - surprise!- a good guy here. Osa Massen, one of the screen's most photogenic stars ever, is radiant. The whole cast carries through the forgivable inconsistencies with style. Ferde Grof√©'s music takes us from exultant triumph to eerie mystery and, finally, into bitter realization of what the RX-M crew discovers, the utter waste of an entire civilization. (Remember the real-life \"face\" on Mars?) Grof√© well-illustrates the withering madness in the crew's panicked escape and return attempt. And the final moments aboard the doomed RX-M are of the stuff that makes for great film. I saw this in theatrical release, and you, too, will find \"Rocketship X-M\" one of your most memorable. Highly recommended to all.",
         "Despite what we would now consider laughable scientific goofs, this science-fiction film carried itself well as a dramatic film. The actors were all solid professionals. The Martian settings were believable. The sentiments, while a bit pretentious, were sincere and laudable. It was an early attempt at mature science-fiction and succeeded better than many more polished, but cynical efforts that came later on.",
         "Rocketship X-M is a solid film, and is a darker, less optimistic effort than 1951's \"Flight to Mars\". The 50th anniversary DVD edition is amazing, and the \"Sepiacolor\" scenes on the martian surface are quite effective. Buffs will notice that the very brief (5 second) image of the ship on the surface is a different image than in the original. The use of Death Valley for the Martian surface (at dusk) is much more effective that in scenes from Flight to Mars, which were probably all shot in a studio. Lloyd Bridges is in love with himself even more than he is with the German girl scientist on board - which is kind of nauseating - but overall, the film is a favorite. Classical music lovers will take note of the music score by Ferde Grofe, better know for his Grand Canyon Suite and other orchestral works.",
         "Writer-Producer-Director Kurt Neumann put together an excellent ensemble cast, and accomplished having Lippert Pictures finance this $96,000 venture in 1950. This is a simple picture that works due to fine direction, players and technical staff. Karl Struss, one of Hollywood's most admired photographers, lensed the picture. One of the best known American composers, Ferde Grofe, wrote the musical score, and one reviewer found it more original than John Williams' STAR WARS score. Although the technical knowledge that exists today dates the picture somewhat, this picture is not campy because it has a serious tone to it, and most audiences key in on that. The original soundtrack recording of the score received an LP release on the Starlog label during the 70's. There are now moves underfoot to re-record the entire score for a CD release, possibly in 2001. ROCKETSHIP XM received some updates in the 70s, when some new special effects scenes were shot and released on VHS. This version is currently available from video sources.",
         "Hot on the heels of George Pal's publicity blitz for \"Destination Moon\" producer Lippert punched this quickie out in an attempt to cash-in at the box office. Pal threatened to sue if Lippert took his rocket to the moon at Pal's advertising expense;Lippert decided to avoid the court and 'knocked' his rocket off course-hence a trip to Mars ensues. Or so the legend goes! what remains is a tight sci-fi soap opera featuring a great supporting cast, and an ominous prediction for our future. By today's standards it is better than \"Destination\", and made for a fraction of the cost.",
         "Rocketship X-M was released about the same time as Destination Moon at the cinemas and was one of the first movies that started the 50's sci fi craze. A rocket blasts off to the Moon, but because of a malfunction, they end up on Mars instead. When on Mars, they explore and discover a ruined city of a past civilization and are attacked by some cavemen type creatures. These are the survivors from that civilization. After exploring, the crew head back to the rocket to return to Earth but it crashlands after running out of fuel, killing all on board. The movie is tinted red for the Mars sequences and the special effects are quite good considering the low budget. The movie stars Lloyd Bridges (Sea Hunt, Around the World under the Sea), Osa Massen as his love interest, Morris Ankrum (Invaders From Mars, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers), John Emery (Kronos), Noah Beery Jr and Hugh O'Brian. I found this movie rather enjoyable and is worth checking out. Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.",
         "Got to remembering this old flick lately and decided to try to find a copy. Imagine my suprise when I found it in a dual pack which included \"Destination Moon\" (1950). Bought them both in a heartbeat! Although both are \"primitively\" produced I personally think they did a good job for what they had to work with. I would be a gas to see a remake of both using todays technology."
