         "Siddhartha done as a Rock and Roll Comedy Western by two of the members of the Firesign Theatre - What's there not to love. Even if you don't recognize the themes of self discovery based on Herman Hesse's classic story of the Buddha's early journey, this is still a fun movie featuring the classic American western outlaw story done as a send-up. It's like a light hearted version of El Topo only it made me laugh where the other made me squirm - in a good way. This is not to say that the story is the same as either. It merely shares the same themes. Particularly amusing are the scenes with Country Joe and the Fish as the bungling highwaymen. Louisiana Man Doug Kershaw as the lone fiddler in black and the James Gang's opening scene are breathtaking and funny at the same time. It reminds me of Hesse's line in Steppenwolf when Mozart laughs at the hero in his dream because he can't hear the music through the static on the radio. This music celebrates the joy of life that epitomized the counterculture rebellion against the darkness of the times. Max Frisch, the Swiss author, defended an attack on the silence of the Swiss writers during the horrors of Nazi Germany by saying he wanted to set up against that all the other things that still can be called life. This movie was part of that movement -- forget superficial commercial ventures like Hair or JC Superstar or the Tommy movie -- this was the musical of the rock and roll generation as much as Rocky Horror was the musical of the Glam Rock generation. Only back then young people were just grateful to be alive and have any dreams at all. It's no wonder that the votes on this one has old farts like me rating it much higher than anyone else. I guess you had to be there back when these musicians couldn't even get radio airplay. I haven't seen this in nearly twenty years when it last played at one of the revival houses but it's one of the few movies whose scenes I can replay in my mind an laugh out loud. This is how we celebrated all those other things that we still called life. Although I would no longer condone such practices, this film appears to have been made to also be enjoyable under the influence of the popular psychoactive alkaloids of the era.",
         "Oh, how I love late 60s/early 70s Hollywood! When the studios figured to capture the turned on youth market, but had NO CLUE what was really going on! Great era when almost anything could be passed off as psychedelic, and weirdos like the Firesign Theatre could co-write a movie and GET IT MADE. Grooovy! 'Zachariah' is a unique, rock'n'roll western, which is so lame brained and misguided it turns out to be one of the most entertaining movies of the period. Just check out the cast! Pretty boy Don Johnson, TVs John Rubenstein, Country Joe and The Fish, and DICK VAN PATTEN! Add to that a Who-inspired James Gang (with a young, clean shaven Joe Walsh) and Coltrane's legendary drummer Elvin Jones, and you've got a truly, er, UNIQUE proposition! Make a great double-bill with 'Tommy'!",
         "Still dont remember why I bought this DVD, or why it sat for 3 years before watching it. Anyway, this movie is a real hoot. From Don Johnson's premiere as an 18 yr old Prom Queen lookalike with a sidearm to Country Joe's surreal insertion into an old west shoot-em-up saloon. The whole thing is just twisted as hell, and fun. A recommended rental with a 6 pack. 7 tokes.",
         "Firesign Theatre has distanced themselves from the film, having spoken of a script they wrote for a comic western \"that was never made.\" But this is a quirky little coming-of-age tale some years BEFORE \"Blazing Saddles\" that has a lot of fun trying to cram rock and roll, dope and westerns into the same screen. Uneven, certainly, but with a number of rewards. Sort of like a Firesign Theatre album.",
         "I saw this movie when it first came out, and I must say that it never tried to appeal to everybody's taste, perhaps not even mine. However, one thing that has stuck with me for more than a third of a century is that someone in the group of about a dozen people that I was with suggested that this was in large part a remake of Siddhartha, just transposed into an off-beat western. Ultimately, the whole group concurred in this assessment, including myself (I had just finished reading the work by Hess -- the year being 1971). I got the feeling it was an effort to concoct a cult classic that just didn't hit the mark. Still, the cast is very representative of a group that would make such an effort, while not taking itself too seriously. Not great art, but a great page from the scrapbook of a counterculture.",
         "I saw this movie when it first came out and occasionally think about it. It was called the 'first electric western', if I remember right. It was fun and funny and I'd like to see it again. I remember little after over thirty years, but I believe it was low budget with mostly outdoor scenes, desert at that. The 'outlaw' gang, 'The Crackers', had their own theme song, which they sang. I think Zacharia and his friend were marijuana farmers in the desert. I believe it was even called a 'cult' film, or something similar. It's hard to remember, after so many years, but I recommend this movie and I'm looking forward to seeing it again myself.",
         "If you have a chance, watch this movie on DVD with an open mind. Know that it is unique in all filmdom, a musical, and every music scene is memorable, especially if you like drums. I saw it in 1972 in a double feature midnight show when everyone else was there for Billy Jack. There's so many ways to praise this movie, especially the cinematography, clever set-design. I always thought Rubenstein was going to be a big star, who knew it would be Sonny Crocket. Here is something a friend recently emailed, for the true connoisseur. \"I engineered the sound track for the James Gang and some others. Went down to effin calinete, south of El Centro.... for the shoot. People were fainting from the heat and we lived on a very watered diet... soups, salads, soups, fruits, and water. Wow... very hot and liquid. If you watch the film, notice the refractions off the acrylic guitars and the liquid backdrop landscape of the heat, coming up from the ground. We had problems with way off background... a truck in the distance that they did not want in the frames... The mountains seemed to be within walking distance but they were miles away. Many people got very sick from the heat. Good film... I was only there for a small portion of the shoot... George Englund (married at that time to Cloris Leachman) having an affair with a woman named Sydney. Marlon Brando was living at George's house because he was involved with someone (?)... Sad to see the poverty there and within the hotel compound, $$$$....\"",
         "I saw this movie in it's first run with a date. She was totally confused, I was excited to see anything with the music I knew, and two Firesign Theater members involved. I was most impressed with Doug Kershaw's music. The James Gang also had one song that rocks more than just about anything else they ever did. I recently found it on Itunes, but was never able to find the music Kershaw played in the film. I wish the soundtrack were available, I'd buy it in a minute. I did buy the LP right after I saw the film and still play it. The rock version of the William Tell Overture is also a riot. Once you hear it, you'll never listen to the classical version the same. The DVD was released a few years ago, and I have it. It's a strange film, but there's certainly nothing remotely like it. A classic.",
         "I've never seen this movie, but I had to jump in to the defense of the Firesign Theatre, and the popular misconception that they wrote this movie. In reading interviews with various members of the comedy team, the Firesign Theatre wrote *the first draft* of this movie which was meant to be a comedic adaptation of Sidhartha, set in the old west. Then what seems to have happened was that the studio executives assigned another writer to do a re-write (and probably tinkered a bit with the script themselves) and the final product bore only a passing similarity to the original script. I do not think that the Firesign Theatre are in any way proud of this movie and don't mention it on their web-site.",
         "When I first saw this film in 1971 I was blown away by the cast, the dialogue (which is almost embarrasing, but fun to listen to now), and the music. Don Johnson and John Rubenstein did an incredible job as wannabe gunslingers and comic moments from the likes of Country Joe were classic. Musically, performances by The James Gang, Elvin Bishop, The New York Rock n Roll Ensemble, etc..., rounded off this film nicely. The plot was predictable, as most are, but the ride was a memorable one. I throw this in the VHS player every once in a while and I'm never sorry I did..."
