         "There are too many reviews of Risky Business for mine to have any relevance as a movie review. However, this movie is for me a time capsule of the era I saw it in, and a photograph of the future to come in American culture. I saw this movie when I was 22 in a tiny college theater with a date. I remember several disconnected things about it: The movie was much more interesting than my date was, the music by Tangerine Dream was hypnotic and fit the tone of the film, which struck me as being more depressing in places than funny (although there are some funny moments in it), and it gave me a glimpse into a world that I thought was fictional. It turned out I hadn't experienced the world it was presenting yet. When Cruise asks his friends what they plan to do with their lives, one's answer is very simple and focused: \"Make money\". Another friend adds: \"Make a LOT of money\". It turns out the movie was precognizant of the next ten to twenty years of American culture; the absolute obsession with making money through any means necessary, legally or illegally, regardless of consequences to yourself or others. Then taking that money and buying the things that will make you happy: a porsche, a big house, and most importantly, a hot babe in your bed, that will only be there as long as the money is. Internally discovered happiness? A quaint notion created by the poor who can't afford the toys that validate your existence. I am sure that the filmmaker would be the first to say that the movie parodies the hollowness of the \"American Dream\" of acquiring wealth to buy creature comforts, but too much of the time it feels like it celebrates them. At the end, the hooker stays Cruise's girlfriend only as long as he continues to make her money; she even says \"I'll be your girlfriend...for a while\". Real loyalty there. But then, she is a hooker, and is being honest. She in fact is presented as the only person in the film that is not a hypocrite. She has no illusions that money & sex make the American world go 'round, and doesn't pretend herself to be otherwise; unlike Cruise and the rest of his friends. In the end however, she is still hollow, the values the kids pursue are hollow (they are even after only sex, not love), and the movie feels as deep and solid as a magazine ad for a lexus. Even over the obsession of greed, however, the film illustrates the complete alienation of the modern American teenage male: alone, isolated, judged by his peers with the kind of car his dad lets him drive, his clothes, and whether he can get laid or not. The emphasis is on sex, not relationship. There is no rite of passage into adulthood, no guidance from parents who more often than not are as distant from their children as the cardboard cutout parents in this film. In short, as depressing as this film is when you step back from it, it paints a frighteningly accurate portrait of how superficial and narrow a world, yet directionless (except for accumulating superficial wealth) a young boy's world can be. There are no values taught in this film, because there are none available as examples. And that is the environment too many kids are subject to. That is what was so disturbing to me about the film at the time I saw it, yet it took 20 years to understand why (as I was, like most kids my age, in the same vacuous and bankrupt culture this kid was in at the time). There are 300% more suicides committed by 14 year old boys in America than any other age group or category. This movie explains why. Seven stars, not for humor, but for photographing the beginning of an era that lasts until this day. The message from Enron, WorldCom, Martha Stewart and others for American kids will be: Don't get caught. A message which is slowly becoming the only \"moral direction\" left in American culture.",
         "RISKY BUSINESS is the smart and sexy 1983 teen comedy that brought intelligence to the genre and made a bonafide movie star out of Tom Cruise. Cruise is utterly winning as Joel Goodson, a high school senior excited about the prospect of having the house to himself when his parents go out of town for a few days; but things go from bad to worse when Joel crosses paths with a nubile prostitute (Rebecca DeMornay). This surprise hit brought an element of sophistication that was absent from a lot of the teen comedies that were populating the screen in the 1980's. This movie boasts a smart screenplay, imaginative direction, a memorable musical score, and on-target performances from Cruise, DeMornay, Curtis Armstrong, Joe Pantoliano (memorable as a slimy pimp), Bronson Pinchot, and Janet Carroll. Tom's sexy underwear dance to \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" has become Hollywood folklore. An instant classic upon release that still holds up over 20 years later.",
         "When this film was released, it was during the time of the \"teen sex comedy\" craze. Films like Class and Porky's were all about seeing scores of horny teens in the most raunchy escapades possible. However, this film and Fast Times at Ridgemont High can be seen as more being a little more serious than the others. Risky Business is definitely a commentary on how greed can corrupt an individual and what the consequences can be. Also, the acting in this film, as well as Fast Times, is light years away from Porky's and all films like it and it will always be a classic parable.",
         "Rebecca De Mornay at 21 is fabulous as the savvy call girl for any teen boy to die for -- or for that matter any red blooded male of any age. She enters the film gliding silently into the back yard entrance of his parent's off-the-lake Chicago house, and after speaking only a few words, something like \"are you ready for me Joel\", artistically slips off her demure little slip of a dress, back arched to him, one leg kneeled in the window seat, presses her bottom into him, silently invites him to take her, and then turns, melts into him, kissing him in apparent yielding passion. This is immediately followed by cut scenes to multiple positions in multiple locations around the house. It's a perfect male fantasy of what paid for wild but romantic sex might be like (however unrealistic). It's also undoubtedly Joel's (Cruse's) first time. What an initiation. The movie never gets that hot again (although the scene enacting Lana's \"thing about trains\" gets close). But it does become increasingly interesting as a first rate coming of age flick. Actually, it's a bit more than that. It explores the tension between the self disciplined deferred gratification he and has friends have all been taught they need for upper middle class success, versus the let loose sexual and other risk taking he knows is out there, some other people are doing, and wishes he could get away with. How far can a nice upper middle class boy go without throwing it all away? That risky business is what the film is all about. Tom Cruz is perfect as the dutiful but less than gifted \"future enterpriser\" high school senior who's always had to work a little harder and stick more to the straight and narrow to try to live up to his parents' expectations -- without quite getting there. Although he was about the same age as De Mornay when they made the film, Cruz looks and acts a thoroughly convincing boyish 16 or 17. De Mornay's Lana is an iconic bad girl hooker of the naturally toney and perhaps feeling variety -- although about the last we're never entirely sure. She remains ultimately an enigma, beyond Cruz's and our full grasp, but not beyond his connecting with. Sadly, her first major role was probably her best -- although certainly not her only good one. Cruz may be \"on the right track\", but it's De Mornay's Lana who knows everything about sex, life, taking risks, and living on the edge. She seduces Cruz into turning his parents' home into a bordello, to tap the money to be made by mingling his kind of friends with her kind of friends for a night, while she is hiding out from her \"manager\", and he has been left to \"act responsibly\" while his parents are away on a business trip. The scene where the Princeton alumnus interviewer, whom his dad has contacted to try to help finesse his \"not quite Ivy League transcript\", comes to the house to interview Cruz on the night the bordello party is in full swing, is deliciously funny and at the same time full of nervous tension. Cruz's character is on the brink of disaster, and then in fact clearly has thrown away a good part of his future opportunities -- or has he? It's a delicious movie -- especially for males raised in seriously high academic achievement oriented families. Every good boy would love to call a Lana sometime -- and get away with it.",
         "Risky Business is a film people unfortunately seem to forget about when they're listing off great teen movies. Tom Cruise, in his first major role, is wonderful as Joel Goodson. He's a boy-next-door type whose life spirals wildly out of control when his parents leave him alone for a few days. Joel is a decent student looking to spend his time wisely during his senior year of high school and hopefully get into a good college. He finds out the hard way that a few bad decisions can lead to all kinds of problems and possibly ruin your future at that age. The film has the intelligence of a John Hughes film combined with the sexual content of a Porky's film. Risky Business is the best of both worlds, if you look at it that way. Tom Cruise's Joel Goodson seems to have a lot going for him. He is the only child living in a nice house in suburban Chicago with his loving parents. You get the sense that he's never been left alone for any extended period of time the way they fawn over him before they leave. After leaving him a decent wad of money and a few instructions about what to do and what not to do around the house, his parents split, and Joel is left all alone. Things go downhill fairly quickly. His best friend (that scene stealing Curtis Armstrong)orders him a prostitute that will show up right at his front door. Needless to say, the person who shows up is not what Joel is looking for. In a fit of sexual frustration, Joels orders the services of the gorgeous, but high-priced Rebecca De Mornay. After a wild night of sex, she informs him he owes her $300. That is substantially more money than his parents left him. Before his dilemma is solved, Joel crashes his father's Porshe in Lake Michigan, gets suspended from school, has a crazed pimp on his tail, and winds up turning his home into a brothel for one night to pay for all the damages he's caused. This plot could have been crafted into an awful movie. Director Paul Brickman knows what he's doing, though. He gives each of his main characters enough dimension that we as the audience actually care what happens to them. We feel Joel's agony as his future seems in doubt during the film's final half hour. Rebecca De Morany is given considerably more depth that you'd think, but we are never allowed to get close enough to truly trust her. Joe Pantoliano is terrific as her pimp, also. Is this film believable? Heavens no. It's plays more like a young man's sexual fantasy run amok. The first scene of the movie mirrors this theme. We see Joel dreaming about having sex with a hot young woman in the shower, then finding himself three hours late for his college entrance exam. We walk such a fine line between pleasure and big trouble at that age..... 9 of 10 stars The Hound.",
         "Most funny comedies aren't very smart. They're funny because of individual jokes that play by themselves, without relying on the overall plot. Risky Business is an exception and the reason why it works so well, is because it tells a simple story that could really happen and would also be a lot of fun. Youre a high school kid, your parents go on vacation for a week, leaving you the whole house to yourself. That's the setup. A friend calls up a call girl, she shows up, and the entertainment begins. This movie is smart enough to know what kids think about at that age, sex, and it holds nothing back. It is very clever at times and has a strong character in Joel, played by a young, energetic Tom Cruise. Another thing that this movie understands is mood and tempo. Everything hits the right beat. Smart and funny is an ideal combination and this movie achieves it.",
         "Risky Business tells the story of Joel Goodsen, portrayed by Tom Cruise, a young teenager who fantasizes about the usual stuff, girls,sex,money,having fun and has the usual concerns,please his parents,getting into college,secure a future.Joel's parents go on a trip and Joel has the house to himself.One of his friends convinces him to answer a sex ad.This is how Joel meets Lana, a beautiful young call-girl to whom he feels immediately attracted to.But Joel is innocent and naive and Lana,knowing this, takes advantage of him, staying in his house longer then she was suppose to stay and involving him in risky situations.The all thing gets quickly out of control which results in a series of accidents such as Joel's furniture being stolen and his father's car falling into a river. Now with his parents returning soon Joel has to juggle between solving the situation and make sure everything looks like the same it did before his parents left. Although it has some funny moments that may cause a few laughs, I wouldn't call Risky Business a comedy.The movie has quite a few dramatic and tense moments.The soundtrack is great and Tom Cruise did a great job as Joel Goodsen.Risky Business is a nice movie that in a way mocks the American dream.With his black wayfarers Cruise oozes style and charisma,no wonder why this movie has become such a classic and is seen as a defining point in Cruise's career. 7.5/10",
         "Tom Cruise stars in this 80's teen flick that was popular for its time and still has a good message to this very day. Tom playing the innocent Joel Goodson, a kid that is on his way to making it big and getting into a good college until he meets up with the call girl Lana(Rebecca De Mornay). This movie just goes to show you how certain decisions can have different impacts on how the overall picture turns out, and Joel sees and realizes just that. The show was cast perfectly and the music adds to spice the movie up. This is a Warner Bros. classic and I think anyone in their right mind should see it.",
         "Your parents are going out of town for a week. You are graduating college and haven't even been laid. Your friends have a future that is secure, but you seem to be going nowhere fast. Maybe, just maybe, while your parents are gone this weekend, you should say, \"What the F*ck???\" (sic, quote from movie) and live a little bit more .... This is a brilliant movie, about life's choices, about living a little, taking chances, with a very positive message for people willing to risk living \"outside the box\". Starring a 17-year old kid who's been thoroughly screwed up by his overly strict parents .... A lot of people miss the point of this movie. Joel takes chances, and pays DEARLY and REPEATEDLY for the chances he takes. He goes at least $1000 in the hole over the course of this movie, but ends up ahead in life because HIS FAMILY had clearly screwed up his brain and having a GIRLFRIEND and TRYING SOMETHING NEW has put him on the road to recovery. A few puritans gave this movie a 5 because they mistakenly think it has something to say about prostitution or making money. Nothing could be further from the truth, and the prostitutes in this movie are the most unbelievable and unpredictable characters, and Joel ends up roughly $1000 in the hole. A few others give it a 5 because the music is by New Age band Tangerine dream, and New Age is still not a very popular media. I give the movie a 10 for message, a 10 for cruise's facial acting (and dancing), and a 10 for irony and twists and surprises, over and over and over again. The love scenes between Cruise and De Mornay are IMHO, as good as anything that's been in movies for the past 20 years, while still being somewhere between PG13 and R rated, e.g. pretty tame.",
         "Risky Business and All The Right Moves are the two films that launched Tom Cruise's career as brat pack film star. Unlike so many of his contemporaries from the Eighties, he's proved to have staying power and will no doubt continue to do so. All The Right Moves established Cruise as a dramatic actor, but Risky Business is a fun comedy about a hormone driven teenager who when the folks go away from his Chicago suburban home and he's left to play, he gets himself in all kinds of problems. First dialing up call girl, Rebecca DeMornay and then not having enough coin of the realm to pay her. Then getting mom's treasured glass egg stolen. And then getting the family car driven into Lake Michigan. But Cruise and DeMornay, who is having trouble with her pimp Joe Pantoliano, hit on the brilliant idea that there's a market out there for his group of eager overachievers. And Tom's house becomes quite the swinging brothel. Risky Business turns out to be pretty funny business. Best scene in the film involves Tom with Princeton interviewer Richard Mazur. You've got to love the way this boy gets into the Ivy League. Second best scene involves Tom and the family car as it plunges into the lake and then gets hoisted out. Tom's definitely proved to have staying power in show business. I can see his character in Risky Business growing up to be Jerry Maguire."
