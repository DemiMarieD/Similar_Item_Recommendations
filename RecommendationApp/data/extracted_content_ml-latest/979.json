         "I sought this film out because I'm a new Frain fan and wanted to see more of his work. First of all, his Irish accent is great. He's got a keen ear for dialects, it seems. His acting was marvelous, as usual. James Frain aside, I thought the film was very well done. It showed the conflict in Northern Ireland as the *mess* it really is. Both sides are guilty of grave injustices, and the men drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstances. Also, it is interesting to realise that not every man (or woman) that is supposedly fighting for his country, is really doing *just* that. For example, when Kenny (James Frain) asks Ginger (Ian Hart) why he does \"it\", Ginger can't come up with a morally acceptable answer. Why? Because Ginger isn't in it for the noble cause of protecting his country or the rights of his fellow Protestants...Ginger is in it for the fun of killing. He's full of blood-lust and it's the perfect job for a guy like him. In a struggle like this there are guys like Liam (John Lynch) who just want to live their daily lives and enjoy their families...guys that see all of the fighting just begats more fighting. There are guys like Kenny that are born leaders full of charisma, and they add fuel to the flames, rather they mean to or not. Also, Kenny genuinely believes in the \"cause\". He believes what he is doing will make a difference in the future...which is a bit odd 'cause his character seems too intelligent for it all. But, like a lot of other seemingly intelligent men, he is sucked into a gang lifestyle not even realizing it...'til it's too late. Then there is Ginger, a pure psycho who isn't in the fighting for any other reason but for the sheer thrill of it, which in a gangland type war makes him a valued asset, some might argue. However, now, in this film, Ginger has out lasted his worth, and has become a very dangerous loose cannon. Everything comes to a boiling point, and predictably, the ending is a tragic one. What makes this film worthy is that is shows both sides of this ages old conflict. Being American, I can't begin to fully understand what all struggle is about. But, I do know there has to be a better way. All in all, a well acted, touching...but troubling film.",
         "I quite enjoyed this movie for two reasons. The first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalism in northern ireland, which is very rarely treated in movies, most of which tell us about the republican struggle. The second reason is the performances of the actors. I thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shores. All in all, it is an entertaining ganster movie with stellar performances from a who's who in northern irish actors cast. It wont move the earth, although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries.",
         "Belfast 1975 and the Republican and Loyalist terrorists call a ceasefire . UVF leader Leonard Wilson realises one of the men under his command is a liability to the ceasefire and orders him \" to be taken care off \" . Meanwhile catholic single father Liam finds himself lost in a Loyalist enclave A couple of days ago I saw CAL after a gap of many years which instantly struck me as being the best film about The Troubles . I had very vague memories of NOTHING PERSONAL seeing it round about 1998 when it was broadcast on channel 4 late one night and not remembering much about it all . Within a short space of time the film totally gripped me due to its intelligence and had me thinking I was going to have to reevaluate my opinion of CAL which was in serious danger of being relegated to being the second best film featuring The Troubles but this didn't happen Why not I hear you ask ? One very easy reply and that is the last ten minutes of NOTHING PERSONAL stops becoming intelligent drama and becomes teeth gnashing melodrama which relies on people doing unlikely things in order have an emotional impact on the audience as to the tragedy of life in Belfast circa 1975 . This is totally unnecessary because this audience member at least was totally caught up in the story without the need for some over the top histrionics being brought in to play in the final scenes Unlike RESURRECTION MAN or THE GRASSCUTTER the screenplay here resists the temptation to paint loyalist terrorists are out and out villains . Of course there's no defence of the indiscriminate violence loyalist terrorists wreaked upon the catholic community and their own during the Troubles but the opening sequence features a bomb attack on a protestant bar which mirrors real life events of the time and gives an excuse for young men to flock to Loyalist terror gangs . It also makes the scathing point that despite Loyalist and Republican terrorists bombing and shooting innocent civilians the terrorist leaders all know their opposite numbers but never think of striking against their opponents The cast are without exception excellent and the bulk of the film is carried by Ian Harte and James Frain who are English and to my untrained Scottish ears never once failed to convince me they were Belfast boys . Frain especially gives an understated performance but manages to portray an inner conflict that he may have to execute Ginger he's been ordered to . It's actually that is very good at portraying a sense of time and place which RESURRECTION MAN failed to do . Like I said this is a very good film that felt the need to over do the dramatics in the last ten minutes which while not totally ruining the film stops it from being a classic one",
         "Some of the acting was a bit suspect. I remember that asswipe Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, yeah OK, he's now dead) launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying NI Protestants as murderers. Now with respect to all NI protestants, this film was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists)and who roamed Belfast in the 1970's. Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. my main moan about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope, it's all doom & gloom, i mean did the little girl at the end have to die. Maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the tact that not all Prods & tiags are bad or wholly good either.",
         "Excellent film from Thaddeus O'Sullivan featuring strong performances from a host of British and Irish actors. The film deals well with a thorny subject matter, and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of 1970s Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict. On one hand, it shows a young Catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles. On the other it deals with a Loyalist gang who are intent on propagating violence. Very interesting and, thankfully, entertaining. Don't be expecting any laughs, though. 7 out of 10.",
         "This movie shows how savage the troubles really are. People who do not want to be involved have no say in the way their lives are altered. This movie shows how the people of Northern Ireland, both Catholic and Protestant are held captive. At any moment their lives may be changed forever whether they want to be involved or not.",
         "I don't normally watch this type of show, but the Irish background is what started me, and it was James Frain's part of Kenny that kept me watching it. Though mostly Irish myself, I don't pretend to understand the IRA, or any of the conflicts that went on there. And though it might be nice to understand it all, it's by no means necessary to enjoy the show. I thought James Frain, & Ian Hart's roles were well balanced, and worked well together. Particularly Kenny's depth of character, of someone who in a long term situation seeing no certain end in site, but still not giving up on those that depend on him, or his loved ones he stands before. The end might be a predictable one, based on the history of what we know, and human limitations in a given situation, but is still effective, and moving. I think the show adequately portrays the lives of people on both sides, caught up in a confusing maelstrom not of their own making, that snowballed, and theres no turning it off and walking away.",
         "being a NI supporter, it's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are hard to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward watch...",
         "I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British. The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles. It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain's partition of Ireland and domination of its history i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland. The characters are portrayed as hapless fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism. Nineties' values about 'machismo', masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish 'psyche' which leads to violence. The stupid song from the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields ..blah..blah.. - is given a symbolic stature, i.e. poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause. Tedious, ahistorical, cheap and nasty trash. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis."
