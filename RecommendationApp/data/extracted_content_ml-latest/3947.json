         "content": "When Jack went home!\r\n\r\nGet Carter, not just one of the finest exponents of British neo - noir, but one of the greatest British films ever, period. Michael Caine stars as Jack Carter, a tough no nonsense operator in the London underworld who returns to his home town of Newcastle Upon Tyne when his brother turns up dead. \r\n\r\nDirected and adapted to screenplay by Mike Hodges from Ted Lewis' novel Jack's Return Home, Get Carter is a bleakly atmospheric masterwork that takes the period setting of the time and blends harsh realism with film noir sensibilities and filters it through an uncut prism of doom.\r\n\r\nJack Carter as created by Caine and Hodges is the quintessential film noir anti-hero. He smokes French cigarettes and reads Raymond Chandler, there is no hiding the respect and homages to classical noir pulsing away as Jack goes on his not so merry way. He's a vengeful angel of death, but sexy as hell with it, he even has humorous pearls of wisdom to spout, delivered with relish by Caine who is at his snake eyed best.\r\n\r\nIn a strange quirk of the narrative, Jack is home but he's a fish out of water, he's a suited and booted Cockney lad moving amongst the flotsam and jetsam of North Eastern society. It's a crumbling landscape of terraced houses and coal yards, of seedy clubs and bed and breakfast establishments where, as Jack wryly observes, the beds have seen untold action.\r\n\r\nJack Carter is a hard bastard, borderline psychotic once his mind has tuned into the frequency that plays to him the tunes of mistrust, of double-dealings, liars and thieves, of pornographers and gangsters who thrive on gaining wealth while the society around them falls into a depression. It's Fog on the Tyne for sure here. Yet Jack is not devoid of heartfelt emotion, his family ties are strong, and there is a point in the film when Jack sheds a tear, it is then when we all know that all bets are off and there will be no coming back from this particular abyss.\r\n\r\nHodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky strip it all back for maximum impact, so much so you can smell the salt of the murky sea, feel your lungs filling up with chimney smoke, the whiff of working class sweat is all around, and all the time Roy Budd's contemporary musical score jingles and jangles over proceedings like a dance of death waiting to reach its operatic conclusion. And with Caine backed up by a roll call of super working class character actors, Get Carter just gets better as each decade of film making passes.\r\n\r\nLike its antagonist/protagonist (yes, Jack is both, a deliberate contradiction) it's a film as hard as nails, where home format releases should be delivered through your letterboxes in a metal case. No lover of film noir can have an excuse to have not seen it yet. Funny, sexy, brutal and not without a ticking time bomb of emotional fortitude as well, Get Carter is the \"A\" Bomb in Grey Street. 10/10",

         "\"Get Carter\" is often said to have inspired the current crop of British gangster films. If this is the case, Guy Ritchie et al must have well and truly got the wrong end of the stick. I haven't actually seen \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" or any of the \"Right Royal Cockney Barrel O'Monkeys\" type films which followed it, but I get the impression that these are merely dumb entertainment for \"new\" lads. In contrast, \"Get Carter\" is unremittingly bleak. If Samuel Beckett wrote a gangster film, it might come out something like this. The grim Newcastle locations add to an atmosphere of decay and despair. The naturalistic camera work avoids cliches and adds effectively to the atmosphere. Long, static shots give the impression of actually being present as a bewildered bystander as the gangsters go about their \"business\". Although the long tracking shots of people walking/running are almost pythonesque at times, this only serves to emphasise the down to earth realism of the film. After all, even violent gangsters have to go through banal routines such as walking down the street. The score is minimalist but very effective, in contrast to the modern British films which seem to be conceived as a gravy train for music publishers and second rate \"indie\" bands. There are few, if any, sympathetic characters. Jack Carter, the central character, is not at all pleasant or heroic. The only people for whom he shows any affection are Frank and Doreen, and he is unable to express this affection except through money and violence. Keith thinks he is Carter's friend, but when he is let down and beaten up he realises that he is being used. Carter does not appear to love Anna, and it is not certain whether she really loves him, although there is a genuine sexual attraction between them. Carter belongs to a misogynistic and hypocritical culture which the film scathingly exposes. The only scene in which he shows any genuine emotion is when he discovers a porn film featuring his niece, Doreen. The cruel irony is that in the opening scene, he was seen looking at dirty pictures with his cronies, and his disgust must be partly directed at himself even though he refuses to acknowledge it. He then expresses his shock and outrage by going straight upstairs to assault and humiliate the nearest woman! And she just happens to have appeared in the very same film as Doreen: a clear case of men projecting their own sexual guilt onto women. The makers of the film cannot have been unaware of the implications of this sexual hypocrisy. The scenes are deliberately juxtaposed to emphasise Carter's ambivalence and double standards. The certainties of a linear narrative have been bravely eschewed. Carter is only able to react to events which are beyond his control and is sometimes led up blind alleys, taking a long time to realise what is really going on. This, again, is realism at its best. Real life does not have a coherent plot and nobody has complete control over their own life. Carter's lack of control is a central theme of the film. He likes to think that he is big, hard and clever, but his acts of revenge are ultimately pointless. Like Frank Machin in \"This Sporting Life\", he is emotionally shallow and able to express himself only through futile acts of aggression. He is cruelly exposed in the final scene as the smile is wiped off his face, the closing shot of the sea emphasising man's powerlessness. The film also contains elements of social comment and class politics. Frank is portrayed as a decent, honest, \"salt of the earth\" working class type, while the slimy and sinister Kinnear has a chauffeur and lives in a big house in the country where he hosts decadent orgies. These themes come to the fore in the (often overlooked) funeral scene. As Frank's small cortege pulls through the gates of the crematorium, we see an endless stream of cars leaving from the previous funeral. The message is that the \"liberation\" of the 60s brought few practical benefits for working class people in the north of England. Again, this relates to the dominant theme of control, or lack of it. The \"swinging 60s\" are exposed as a dead end of pointless hedonism. The extent of women's liberation is also questioned. \"Get Carter\" portrays a society in which women are not at all liberated except in a few superficial ways. The female characters in the film are all victims, owned and used by men who see them as sex objects and little more. It is implied that the sexual freedom brought by the contraceptive pill has benefited men more than women. It's not all angst and depression though. There is some good fighting, swearing, shooting and dangerous driving. There are also many subtle touches of black humour. Nevertheless, this is not a mindless action film. The consequences of violence are never ignored or glossed over. We are shown Keith lying on his bed in agony after getting a severe beating, leaving us in no doubt that his brief flirtation with gangsters has ruined his life. \"Get Carter\" is a masterpiece, although it will not be to everyone's taste. If you want non-stop action, try a mindless Arnold Schwarzeneger film. There is nothing for you here. However, if you are prepared to approach \"Get Carter\" with an open mind and think about it rather than be a passive observer demanding to be entertained, you will find a rewarding work of art with hidden depths. Forget Guy Ritchie. The only worthy successor of \"Get Carter\" is Neil Jordan's \"Mona Lisa\", which addresses similar themes and is equally bleak and disturbing.",
         "This is one of Caine's best roles and undoubtedly one of the greatest gangster/crime films ever made. It is unrelentingly harsh, gritty, and bleak in showing the nasty world of Carter. Few characters are truly likable or admirable and most have a mix of good and bad. This applies to Carter himself and even the bystanders or victims. Everyone is portrayed as flawed somehow, even those who are tragic. This is one of many aspects that adds to the realism of this film. This grittiness is true not only of the world of crime, but the entire world of the early post-industrial Northern England, once at the forefront of the industrial revolution but by then a depressed backwater that had yet to feel the true benefits of recent social and economic changes. It thus provides some subtle social commentary as well, although one may easily miss it. In addition to its raw grittiness, the film is also very intense. There is a building tension throughout, and a palpable that things are not right. At the same time, the events, in particular the action and violence are rather slow but relentless. In fact, the way the film presents the violence and action is one of the keys to its greatness. It is an unusual, fascinating, and very powerful depiction. There isn't gore or even lots of blood or the like and, like the rest of the film, it generally progresses slowly and calmly. It's not exhilarating or glamorous, but instead deliberate, relentless, and, above all, cold. The coldness of the violence and how Carter in particular, but others as well, kill and hurt in an unfeeling, perfunctory manner makes it seem all the more harsh. Another interesting aspect of the film is the juxtaposition of the idea that someone can force or change events around him against the feeling that one can merely react to events beyond his control. Both of these themes seem to clash in Carter and his actions, for one of these themes may at times appear to be what's happening, yet in the end it seems that the other exerts its dominance. Ultimately, this is superb, extremely gritty, and powerful drama. It contains action and violence, but it is not an action film and most expecting a non-stop action film, with flashy fighting, \"getting the bad guys,\" etc. may well be bored.",
         "If Shakespeare could have written a gangster movie, \"Get Carter\" would surely be the one. Jack Carter is the 1970s embodiment of classical tragic heroes like Hamlet or Macbeth. Also, in the finest Shakespearian tradition, as the film reaches its climax, the bodies begin to mount with alarming rapidity. The film is initially a slow-burner, but what is arguably a career-best performance from Michael Caine sustains interest until the plot begins, in every sense, to kick in. And when it does, there's no stopping it, as Carter ruthlessly, and recklessly, sets about dealing with his enemies. The industrial city of Newcastle is depicted as gritty, seedy and unapologetically working class. The grainy camerawork gives the impression that this is a real-life documentary rather than a gangster flick. Probably every British gangster movie since has used \"Get Carter\" as a benchmark, particularly \"The Long Good Friday\", or even the revoltingly trendy \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". Any why shouldn't they? For the ultimate British gangster icon, you need look no further than Jack Carter and his silver Ford Cortina. A genuine classic.",
         "Strongman and enforcer Jack Carter (Michael Caine) returns to his native North East (of England) to investigate the suspicious death of his brother. Here he encounter a world of sleaze, booze, violence, casual sex and people in search of easy money. Hard to call it a classic early British gangster film given that they were so few around, but more a cracking thriller that makes full use of its cast, plot and (unusual) Newcastle Upon Tyne location. Writer-Director Mike Hodges wanted violence with reality and he delivers it with real punch. Unlike most thrillers bystanders are not immune from the action and at various stages harsh punishment is handed out for minor crimes by anti-hero Caine. Caine underplays his hardman role nicely - letting the action, rather than his emotions, tell the story. Several people claim real-life events \"inspired\" this story, but as far as I can tell the only direct reference to real events is that the one-arm bandit business started to earn big money (in the North East) and London gangsters \"wanted in.\" That lead to bloodshed, but that is not the thrust of this film - although one of the main characters is, indeed, in that business. Having gone to the trouble of reading the screenplay, I was surprised how thin the dialogue was. This is a good example of how it is better to \"show\" things rather than \"tell.\" I did learn, however, that the thugs that come to beat Caine up are supposed to be gay - one may wear a pink neckerchief but I thought that was just the dandy fashions of the day! Those that are not familiar with Newcastle may also like to note that the place is nowhere near the sea, in case you decide to take a holiday up there and are thinking of packing your trunks! On release the film did well enough in the UK, but died a death in the USA due to being released as a double bill with Dirty Dingus Magee: A terrible Frank Sinatra movie. If you like hard-edged thrillers that don't play nice then Get Carter may well be worth your time and effort.",
         "Forget Lock stock...this is how a British gangster film should be made. Michael Caine is excellent as the London based hardman going back to Newcastle to avenge the death of his brother. The use of provincial locations in the early 1970s is almost unique in british cinema. Newcastle itself, it has to be said,looks as cold and ruthless as Jack Carter himself and wouldnt be used by the North of England tourist board.Look out for some first rate performances especially Ian Hendry and the playwrite John Osbourne as a sinister Mr Big.The film is violent and uncompromising but also very entertaining with a neat line in black humour. Dont miss it!",
         "If there can be anything such as a 'generic genre', then the great British gangster film must be it. But don't blame Get Carter for this, blame Madge's husband, Guy Ritchie. I saw Get Carter again recently and it must be the least dated film from the seventies ever made. This is largely because the situations, characters, settings and even fashions are so slice of life. It's a lot more convincing than a lot of the Sean Penn stuff at the moment, and even hyper-real stuff like Gummo or Julian Donkey Boy. I think this is because there's no exaggeration in Get Carter. It's not shot in some weird hicky town in the middle of nowhere, it's shot in Newcastle, one of the UK's major cities. And Get Carter tells it like it is. It is this no-nonsense style that still makes it look one of the coolest films around. Also, there aren't any heroes, which is a good thing. Well, how many 'heroes' have you met? Carter, though no hero, is a great character, make no mistake about that, and he shows just enough emotion for the audience to identify with him: like when he stumbles across his dead brother's daughter in some seedy porn film, and the whole motivation for his revenge mission in the first place. But he is a cold blooded killer too, hardened by London's gangland, and violence is his main emotional outlet in everything else - sex etc - he's pretty cool. It's not just the killers he's after, it's anyone even associated with it. And he dispatches them with a passion. \"I know you didn't kill him!! I know!!\" and \"Goodbye ----!!\" being two memorable sign offs. I really do believe this is a better film than Godfather. Godfather exists in a world most of us will never experience and is one of the best Hollywood films. Get Carter though, exists in our world, and the superb characters, acting and writing make it totally believable - even when Michael Caine walks naked out of the door of his seedy B & B with his shotgun to escort out some local hoods, the most memorable thing you remember about the scene is the previously belligerent moaning old lady neighbour scurrying into her house, terrified. Oh, and Budd's soundtrack is pure sleazy brilliance, well up to the standard of virtually everything else about the film.",
         "British gangster classic starring Michael Caine as the eminently quotable, ultimately tough Jack Carter Hard to believe that a major studio felt the need to remake this British gangster classic, which ranks up there with the likes of The Long Good Friday as one of the finest home grown films of the past 30 years. Caine is the gangster who goes to Newcastle for his brother's funeral and begins to suspect his death was no accident; cue edgy thrills and violence as he exacts revenge on the folks he believes responsible. Caine, as in the majority of his signature roles, is superbly armed with a set of eminently quotable one-liners (\"You're a big man, but you're out of shape\" tops the bill this time), and as emotionally detached and violently ruthless as Point Blank's similarly vengeful Lee Marvin, while director Hodges paints a gritty, bleak picture of the gangster underworld. Soap fans will be equally intrigued to see Coronation Street's Alf Roberts (aka Bryan Moseley) being tossed off a roof.",
         "Michael Caine has often said that GET CARTER was the first gangster movie not to portray gangsters as either being stupid or funny . He`s right , but he could also have added that this was probably the first film not to show gangsters as being sexy in anyway . Sure Glenda , Magaret etc might be physically attractive but sexy ? I don`t think so . And the men aren`t any less unattractive , almost all of them are cowardly two faced weasels or violent thugs and often these character traits overlap. Director Mike Hodges has made a bleak , nihilistic classic film . He isn`t flashy unlike present day film makers associated with gangster flicks but that`s not a criticism . I love the way Hodges makes use of the locations in showing the North East of England as a cold , austere windswept urban area of high rise council estates and red brick terraced houses with outside toilets . There is a train of thought that by showing the audience all this it dates the film but it`s also true that it reminds us that living standards are also different today . No one takes a phone call in the pub because everyone has a mobile phone nowadays , the internet and videos have replaced slide shows and silent 8mm as the medium for porn , and it`s now illegal to dump the slag from coal mining into the sea because of EU regulations GET CARTER also has some really great dialogue which I could sit here all day quoting . But I won`t bother except to say my favourite line is when Carter jumps out of bed naked and holds a gun on Con and Peter Con : Put it away jack you know you won`t use it Peter : The gun he`s talking about classic dialogue from a classic film",
         "This is a gangster movie which takes the central figure-hardly the hero, because Carter (Michael Cane) is a brutal racketeer-out of the confines of Soho and away up north to the gangland of Newcastle-upon-Tyne... The plot concerns Carter's efforts to discover who was responsible for the death of his brother... Against the wished of his London gang-boss he takes the train to Newcastle, and embarks upon a single-handed crusade of violence against the north-country gangsters... \"Get Carter\" is a film which, in its way, is as ruthless as Don Siegel's 'Dirty Harry.' Carter is not a likable character... He is a perplexing lead character whom we never grow to care about, or even understand... He just happened to be a crook and a murderer pursuing his own private vendetta... Memorable scenes include Caine with a shotgun ejecting a couple of thugs from his bed-and-breakfast; the car going into the docks with an unnoticed passenger in the trunk; and a mob boss taking a dive from a multi-story parking garage...",
         "After finally getting to see the 1971 version I think two things I know why people hated on the remake with Stallone & dang for this time period I bet this movie was flagged for some of the content. This movie is plain and simple just perfect in the revenge noir. It starts a tad slow but it is building up character backgrounds a little but is well worth it. This flick has fooled from start to finish even though you think your on track. Caine is great as a gangster with no regrets for what he is or what he's done ever.There's just one rule don't mess with a man's family especially a bad man. He doesn't take kindly to the misfortunes of his brother who has lived a good & truthfull life,or you will have to pay the price."
