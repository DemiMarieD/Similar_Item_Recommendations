         "This is one of those films which you can watch a dozen times and get something different out of it each time. Lots of guest appearances in this movie. I remember the first time I watched it and thought he looks familiar then realized it was Timothy Leary (Tune In, Turn On, and Drop Out Dude from the 60's) not long before he died. I had seen him on a lecture tour around the same time as the movie came out. Also people like Arlo Guthrie, David Carradine, Don Cheadle, John Cusack, etc. My favorite part is the entire section with David Carradine. This is a road trip movie and if I didn't already know who had directed it, I would have thought it was a Robert Altman film. Lots of good weirdness and things for you wrap your head around. Quite a few \"in\" jokes that you might not catch the first time you see it. If you watched one time and thought it was okay, then watch it again.",
         "A blue-collar joe seeking to fulfil a dead man's last wish finds himself sucked into a spiritual journey and questioning his own life. This is a film that lends itself to being misunderstood. Previous comments have listed it as \"rambling\", and I can see where it might appear that way. Just remember the name of the film. It's not about the quest to bury ashes. It's about personal enlightenment and breaking away from a static, nowhere life. Rich characters and counter-cultural icons litter this film. Definitely a find if you're a fan of movies like \"Alice's Restaurant\" and \"Fritz the Cat\".",
         "A movie most people will love or hate. I think it is one of the greatest of all time, but it wont appeal to the hoi polloi. The story of a guy on a mission to scatter the ashes of a casual acquaintance in some unknown remote Nevada gambling town along with his nerdy sidekick. This movie is entertaining in a quirky way but the coolest thing about it is the people the bikers meet and the things that they say. Those people are the Roadside Prophets, and it is the words of those prophets that was the neatest think about the movie. The Prophets are Tim Leary, Arlo Guthrie, John Cusack, David Carradine, and more. This movie reminds me of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Dead Poets Society wrapped together with the Firesign Theater. The motorcycle trip is a interesting carrier story line for the real message, which is a philosophical one. Do something with your life. Let your roman candle burn brightly. Don't waste your time sitting on the sidelines. Abbe Wool is a genius.",
         "Road movies aren't easy to pull off. 'Roadside Prophets' tries and isn't entirely successful, but still has enough cool scenes and good intentions to make it worth watching. Musicians turned actors, Doe (X) and Horovitz (Beastie Boys) play bikers who form an uneasy partnership. One of the problems with the movie is right there - Doe is a natural actor, Horovitz isn't, and doesn't convince. Anyway, the two set out travelling across America, in a deliberate homage to 'Easy Rider', and the movie in a subtle way is a eulogy for the 60s and a comment on the changes America has seen since then. Many interesting faces pop up in cameos - John Cusack, Timothy Leary, David Carradine, Don Cheadle and Alex Cox regular Biff Yeager to name several - which is half the fun. Especially Cusack's character. It was a pity there wasn't more of him here. 'Roadside Prophets' is uneven, but still enjoyable. If you like this I suggest you have a look at the road movies of Canadian director Bruce McDonald, especially his superb 'Highway 61', a more original and successful movie than this.",
         "I enjoyed the movie immensely. Sometimes it reminded me of the 1992 \"Highway To Hell\" movie, which also seems a bit of a \"trip\". Being a biker helps when seeing this movie. One 'understands' it, like teens are supposed to 'understand' \"Wayne's World\". At times one doesn't quite understand some of the 'visions' the characters have, and one has to guess. Basically, it's a biker fantasy (the boss' daughter on the phone covering for the biker cos she's got a crush on him) with some dark comedy thrown in. I'd say it's almost a \"serious\" Cheech & Chong type of movie.",
         "I rented this movie years ago and have been hoping for a DVD release for years so I can show everyone I know how funny it is. There are so many wonderful cameos in this, too many to list, but mostly you are left with the performances of john doe and adam horovitz. They lead you on a journey we all go on inside ourselves especially while we grow up. Who the hell are we and what do we want from life? How much do the people in our lives mean to us and what would we do for them push come to shove? I know many would think that is too deep for this romp but then I suppose many people consider deuce bigelow real cinema. Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone who for one thing is a nut about music and wants to see some of their favs in a new light and for anyone else with a mind that wanders, take a wander with these roadside prophets.",
         "The main character of this film is on a journey to find a place his dead friend (who he knew for all of 3 hours) talked about and scatter his ashes there. Along the way he bumps into a young man with an obsession with a chain of motels and fireworks who eventually ends up following him everywhere. They become friends (sort-of) and have a very strange adventure indeed. I bought this film to see Adam Horowitz and he gave a great performance. John Doe was average at best but the star had to be John Cusack in a small cameo. Worth watching if you like very odd films. I do so I give it **** out of *****!",
         "This is definitely one of those kick back in your sofa, light up and flow movies. The subdued plotline is warm and insightful and the many cameos in this movie are always a surprise waiting around the next corner. If you are walking the path or surfin the wave like some of the rest of us, check this movie out.",
         "For those late nights when all you have to entertain yourself with is a TV and a good buzz, \"Roadside Prophets\" saves. This movie has been hailed as the, \"best ever\" and that is quite a stretch but, I love it to death nonetheless. I got sucked into it when I noticed Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz was in it. He may not be the best actor but he is interesting enough to pull it off. There are many cameos by some of my favorite personalities. What makes this movie great are the lazy scenes out on the road and somewhat non existent plot. It's one of those flicks that let you leave the couch when you really can't. Roadside Prophets gives you the feel of total freedom and crazy misadventures out on the open roads of America's west. For the first time in 38 years I am tempted to buy a bike (but I wont).",
         "This movie definitely falls in between of what people like to see and what they like to hope for.. While most of the blockbusters, that come out nearly every week, filled up with the special effects, but the \"Prophets\" show the simplicity of the idea, and the execution is on the top level! Two guys, bikers, hook up out of the blue, and end up becoming more than just simple pals, because, Joe takes on a challenge to see to his new passed friend last will... i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see beyond the shine of Hollywood and glamour of most of the sunset strip. View it, you may like it!! Cheers."

         "Bizarre and surreal road movie about a biker and his unlikely sidekick. On a quest to fulfill a friend's last wish, Joe takes to the desert road on his 1957 Harley-Davidson and meets a succession of odd characters, including Sam. Sam begins following Joe, on a quest of his own, which necessitates staying in Motel 9's wherever they go. Themes such as friendship, faith, and isolation are brought into sharp relief by strange situations, the lonely road, and the stark emptiness of the desert. There are also several humorous cameos.",
