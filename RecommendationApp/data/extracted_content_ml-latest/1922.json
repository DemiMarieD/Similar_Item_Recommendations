         "It wasn't originally my intent to comment on this film, but, after seeing some of the idiotic postings denigrating this fine effort, I felt compelled. I was rather taken aback by the honesty of this tale. To quibble about the automobiles or the Hardee's cups shows such a lack of perception as to what was attempted here, that it truly boggles the mind. The dissenting voices here clearly prefer the artificial, rose-colored-glasses view of high school as offered by \"Sixteen Candles\" or other films of John Hughes. But, for most, and maybe this realization only becomes apparent once one has some significant distance from one's high school experience, for most the high school experience is NOT a star-spangled memory a la \"Ridgemont High\", \"Dazed and Confused\", or even \"American Graffiti\". These formulative years, more often than not, are times of discovery, of embarrassment, of confusion. and of long stretches of boring and mundane matters. Writer/director Skoog captured, with no illusion whatsoever, the awkwardness of this period, with the realism and honesty worthy of of a Ken Loach or Mike Leigh. For most people, life is NOT \"Ten Things I Hate About You\", it is about self-discovery and awareness, and sorting out one's rightful place in the human equation. Skoog's two main characters superbly realized this human comedy. Anna is a beautiful, talented young girl who has not come to grips with either her talent nor her beauty. She is so easily buffeted by the forces surrounding her, be it her bad-girl best friend or the men who are more than willing to introduce her to the awkwardness of sexual initiation, that it is often heartbreaking to watch. The fact of the matter is that bad things happen to good people, and in watching Anna attempt to navigate her way through her voyage of discovery, the film subtly explores its themes with rare honesty. The treatment of sexuality is amongst the film's strongpoints. The peer pressure to conform and the curiosity of the unknown is explored with sensitivity. The bare boobs approach of most teen films is abandoned here for a heartfelt examination of the myriad of forces that are involved in human sexuality...the various dynamics, be they sexual or power, that make the experience a lot more than just a procreative act. These aren't \"characters\", these are living, breathing people with inexplicable, self-destructive urges as well as a completely realistic complacency that often allows them to be drawn into situations that are not in their best interests. This is one of the finest coming-of-age films I have ever seen. If you are a mature, perceptive cinema lover without need for an artificial, romanticized approach to the teen experience, do yourself a favor and check out, \"Whatever\".",
         "What a movie!!! A pleasant surprise I caught purely by accident the other night on the Sundance channel. As a person who was 13 in 1981, this movie struck a chord in me that wasn't just nostalgia. Most of the characters were memorable and more than just a little familiar to me; Ana, VERY real, I knew half a dozen girls like her, including me. Her English professor, the spiteful and vindictive Mr. Stanley, who didn't have a pain in the ass teacher like this? All of the various heads, drunks and sluts that flocked to Friday night keggers and house parties. Even her ever-hopeful, yet terribly sad mother was a brilliant touch. The script was so well written, in that, while there wasn't much of a real storyline, a few days in the life really, even the secondary characters were anything but one dimensional. I loved the soundtrack as well, not only did it make me want to break out some of my highschool vinyl, it did a great job of enhancing scenes without taking over and drowning out the actors. The best thing about this movie though, no FAKE, sugary Hollywood ending!",
         "Yes, this is a \"real\" movie. It's certainly not getting the attention of the mainstream Hollywood summer blockbusters but it's a lot more powerful and enjoyable. Synopsis: The story takes place in a working class new jersey suburb set in 1981 and centers on a young woman, Anna Stockard played by newcomer Liza Weil. Anna, in her senior year of high school, comes from a broken family, hangs out with the party crowd and is uncertain of her future. Although seemingly intelligent and artistic, she lacks focus. It's unclear if Anna will end up like her hard drinking and drugging friends or fulfill her ambition to go to art school in New York City. The film was written and directed by New Jersey native Susan Skoog and unlike other films about the 80's (e.g., Boogie Nights), \"Whatever\" provides a very realistic view of this era. The clothing, hair styles, slang, and music all represent the suburban early 80's not the Hollywood version. Although many of the characters are unappealing, the film still manages to capture you. I was both riveted and disturbed by it. Weil carries the film by playing Anna with a stoic integrity - you sense that she is a survivor. Skoog has created a film where you feel as if there was a hidden camera viewing a real teenager's life back in 1981. Skoog and Weil appear to have promising careers ahead of them. If you want to see asteroids, bombs, fireballs and explosions, the 10 plex has a whole bunch of them. If you want to see a movie that is affecting, albeit, slightly disturbing, drive a little further and checkout \"Whatever \".",
         "Whatever is a great slice-of-life coming of age story, this time about two young girls in their last year of high school. One girl is awkward looking and shy, but talented with a bright future as an artist. The other is prettier and popular, but not really destined for much. Both live their formative years in a backwater New Jersey suburb and their lives are far less polished and sanitized than those portrayed in most teenage coming of age films these days (TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, SHE'S ALL THAT, etc...) This film is gritty and real and the characters are powerful. It's hailed as a great 'chick flick\" because it's focus is these two girls, but it's more than that. I thought they did a great job portraying a realistic world. Hell, the high school party scene was stolen right out of my life! ;) In any case, the acting is superb. The two girls, Anna and Brenda are played by Liza Weil (Stir of Echoes, A Cur for Serpents) and Chad Morgan (Co-Ed Call Girl). They find themselves looking for their own identity in the midst of messed-up family lives and peer pressure. Anna's the daughter of a single mother who works as a waitress and has affairs with rich married men to help support her kids. Brenda suffers through years of sexual abuse at the hands of her step-father. Both find escape and comfort in their pursuit for adulthood -- hopping from one new experience to the next in search of themselves. Drugs, sex, lawlessness... all of these things become part of their lives, and things which they must overcome in order to survive.",
         "I don't think I'd ever heard of this film, but it caught my eye in a table of used videos for sale. I enjoy the TV show Gilmore Girls and recognized Liza Weil on the cover. What a gem this film is! It's not \"entertaining\" like most escapist films, it's a fairly realist look into the life of a girl who may have a future or who may slide into a miserable life of drugs and drink, perhaps even crime. I found it engrossing, and marveled at Liza Weil, so little utilized in the TV programs I've seen her in. Frederick Forrest also stands out as an enthusiastic art teacher, and I enjoyed how the ex-con was more than a stereotype.",
         "Okay, this was not light entertainment, as so many teenager flicks are. Perhaps I am biased, because it is set in a place and time not too different from my own high school years, but this rang true to my recollections of HS. certainly better than Sixteen Candles, Say anything, etc.. (not that I don't enjoy those movies, but...) This was a less polished Breakfast Club, without the sappy smarmy feel good ending. Mostly. Ms. Weil was very engaging, attractive enough and very believable, without being the usual beauty queen female lead common to HS films. Particularly revealing was the two girls talking about her loss of virginity, when she says \"It felt really good at first. Then he put it in.\" and her friend replies \"yeah, it does kind of hurt. Unless you're drunk.\" Not great wisdom, but probably recalls many girls first experiences.",
         "I thought this film was a thoughtful reflection on an overlooked period of time. The significance of it's taking place in 1981 was the last hurrah of the \"Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll\" era. AIDS soon followed, and casual sex died. The sex is a big part of the story, a realistic portrayal of a teenage girl's struggles with her newborn womanhood. The peer pressure to do drugs, smoke, and have crazy meaningless/meaningful sex, all induced by the young idiots around her, happens to most American kids. Anna's dreams of art school are nearly crushed by the combination of her friends, her lonely, pathetic mother, and the usual teenage self-deprecation. It's not hard at all to relate to this character. It seems that this movie was too subtle for some viewers. Perhaps some people don't want to know the female side of stories we've seen the male counterparts of (quite redundantly) through the years. I welcomed the fresh point-of-view the film possesses. My only true beef would be that it may have been a little too long, but then again, wasn't this writer/director Susan Skoog's first film? A good film with fine direction of realistic performances (with the exception of the \"nerdy\" teacher - ugh) and a nice accompanying soundtrack. Overall, I liked it quite a bit.",
         "While many will write this off as a slow and plotless waste of celluloid, I found it to be an excellent portrayal of the disconnection and confusion that plagues our youth. Sad to say, this could have had a \"based on a true story\" title card at the beginning. I've known girls who expressed their praise towards this film for it captures their growing-up period perfectly. If it feels like it's going nowhere, well that just adds to the film's realism. Unlike KIDS, the lead character finally is conscious of her transgressions and thus finds redemption. I find that reason alone, as well as the entire film, worthy of the recognition that it deserves. Rent it with an open mind...",
         "I've seen this movie during the preparation for broadcast at editing machines and during the dead period of night, somewhere around 3-4 in the morning and I think it's a brilliant example of auteur conceptually clean peace of work, visually balanced and with realistic atmosphere shots, especially during parties. It's female movie, and that's also what I like, so I can explain the lack of strong point, so usual in man movie making business. The plot is about growing and search for identity in confusing and ruthless capitalism. Under the shiny surface there are always confused kids entering in world of grownups and so aware of all filthy things they folks do. They don't know what is good or wrong any more, easily misunderstand and lost. Although, I could be pain in the ass and search for dramatic holes and some clichÃ© in portrait of some of the characters. Some of them are more types then characters \u0096 example \u0096 Art professor is type of looser in the world of art, and boldly enthusiastically supportive for Anne but hardly expresses any of his goals, his own characteristics. But those are small lacks. Definitely worth seeing.",
         "WHATEVER is one of the best first-time-director/writer films I've ever seen. It's up there with Whit Stillman's METROPOLITAN: intelligent script, beautifully photographed, tragicomic, sensitive and bull's-eye psychology, a cast of unknowns whose performances rise off the celluloid in their perfection. Susan Skoog, bless you: may you have a long, long career in an industry which seldom allows such living and breathing females and males onto its screens! I bought a videocassette copy and will enjoy it again and again. What slice-of-life realism! This stuff happens all the time, but we seldom see it so artistically processed and integrated. I like this film lots: can you tell?"
