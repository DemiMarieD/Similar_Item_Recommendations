         "We bought this movie on videotape from the Naturally Native website and we both really, really wanted to like it. It's definitely a milestone film for the industry for a number of reasons. But unfortunately, it's something of a stinker. The main problem with the film is how much it suffers from bad writing. The dialogue is often choppy and cliche. And the writer tries to somehow work in every single issue confronting modern Native Americans, which is just overkill. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be anyone exercising good control over the writer, who also co-directed and starred in the film. There were a number of scenes left in that should have been cut, as they don't have anything to do with the plot or development of characters. You can tell the actors really gave it their all, but I wondered how they didn't break out laughing at some of the terrible dialogue and implausible scenes they were given. On the other hand, the basic plot of the film is very sound and good. I hope that in another 5 years someone comes along and remakes the film, with an edited script and a little more preparation. There are a few really touching or funny scenes. Some (though unfortunately not most) of the acting was really, really good. And it's always good to see contemporary native topics addressed in film.",
         "Naturally Native (1998) C-110m. *½ D: Jennifer Wynne Farmer, Valerie Red-Horse. Valerie Red-Horse, Irene Bedard, Kimberly Norris, Pato Hoffman, Collin Bernsen, Mark Abbott, Floyd Red Crow Westerman. Disappointing film with an refreshing storyline: three sisters decide to create a beauty line utilizing indigenous practices and discover a winding road. Poor acting (save for Bedard) and some repellent dialogue deaden bright, emotional moments in this all-indigenous feature. Red-Horse is credible and addresses many vital issues but her screenplay is still awfully diffuse (not to mention contrived) and shoddy production values do no service, though it has a nice ending.",
         "This movie had a great basis... three Native American sisters who want to start their own business, and in the process learn much about their past, their people, and discover themselves in a ... well, touching way. Unfortunately, the writer / director / star, Valerie Red-Horse, was completely out of control in her efforts. The movie suffers badly from a disjoint plot (must they deal with every issue confronting Native Americans?), typically conspicuous product placement (I recoil at such an otherwise brave idea being tarnished by name-dropping companies such as Walmart -- pay the bills a little more subtly please), boring dialog which is far too transparently forwarding some sort of political agenda (I really dislike the reciting of facts and figures in movie, a la the meeting with the agent from the Bureau of Indian Affairs), as well dated plot devices (I was already very tired the \"new-age\" concept of self-actualization by 1998, and this movie serves it up in very liberal amounts). It is as if the directing of the movie simply spiraled out of control as production went on and no one had the courage to reign things back into control. I wonder where the co-director, Jennifer Wynne Farmer, was during the directing of the movie? I assume that Ms. Red-Horse had most of the control of the movie. I could be wrong. The bottom line is that this is a movie that has a very noble sentiment, wonderful efforts by most of the cast, but a very sophomoric sheen and a lot of ridiculous scenes and dialog which disappoint greatly. I hope that in the future, as we grow farther away in time from the greatness and power of the Native American nations, more efforts will be made by indigenous Americans to portray Native Americans in film. Indeed, I hope that the makers of this very movie have matured and honed their craft in the years since this movie was released (1998), and that they do something else which shows this maturity. I'm sure Ms. Red-Horse has heard the criticism loud and clear and I hope she has taken it to heart, and the movie itself had just enough good to it that I expect something much better next time. I personally want my children to love, respect, honor, and revere American Indians. Americans often look to Hollywood for enlightenment and education on such topics as Native Americans. I hope that Hollywood can do a better job of making a movie that actually entertains and educates the public on this venerable, important, and far too overlooked topic.",
         "I love this film. It's one of my favorites of native films it speaks to me as a native person more than smoke signals or pow-wow highway can because it's more true too life. Also it's based in Southern Calif. where I too live. So many of the people I know are like the people in this film. A lot of Skins were adopted out in the 50's and early 60's we are all now struggling with issues of identity, place, and belonging this film really talks to those issues. It's also at it's center offers something that everyone can relate too, how do we hold our family together when economic forces are placing pressure on us driving us apart, how do we find love and happiness and not lose ourself's in the process. I can certainly see why women would love this film all the central characters are strong women having to make difficult choices but in the end they manage to prosper and hold on too their dreams and to each other. It's a really good film. Never found a DVD version of it if someone can tell me how I can get one please email me the information thanks. (If you haven't seen it add it to your collection this is a keeper).",
         "The first feature film backed entirely by a Native tribe, NATURALLY NATIVE is an uplifting drama about three sisters trying to start a natural cosmetics business. As orphaned children they were adopted by a suburban white family and lost ties to their father's reservation. The story explores their ambitions, relationships and identity issues as the sisters' pursue their dream. New MBA Karen is at a crossroads in her career and avoids relationships, even with a persistent suitor on the scene. Big sister Vicky struggles with self-acceptance and the temptation to relax from hectic family life with a glass of wine. But she knows alcohol killed their mother, and loving husband (a wonderful Pato Hoffman) is opposed to alcohol. Tanya the youngest and least grounded sister, is looking for love but won't date Native Americans, leading to a dangerous encounter with a white man. The heartfelt script was written by Red-Horse out of frustration at the Hollywood system with it's limiting portrayals of Natives. Interestingly, it is her character in the film who openly expresses that anger. But the movie is obviously made with tremendous love. Engaging performances make the point that we are all more alike than we are different. A moving, sympathetic and inspiring movie.",
         "This film is definitely a masterpiece. Well-written, beautifully acted, and with a powerful message to which anyone can relate, Naturally Native delivers a theme and substance that many films are lacking these days. This is a film about people, and the trials they face in a world suffused with the prejudices and insecurities generated by cultural boundaries. Moreover, what this film offers is the power of hope against all odds, and how hope, love, and the unwillingness to surrender to worldly obstacles can help people attain their dreams. This film a must see for all audiences, for it is films like this that inspire our being, that give us hope in a world that has become so desensitized to the plight of its own human elements. Its theme is timeless, its message profound. Within each character we can see the multiple facets of our own selves, particularly the apprehensions generated by our faults, and how those apprehensions can be overcomes by the acceptance of our heritage and the willingness to stand up to negative circumstances. This is something with which anyone can identify, irrespective of race or color. As such, Naturally Native delivers a theme not just for Native Americans, but for humanity as a whole."
