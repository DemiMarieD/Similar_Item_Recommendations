At times it's jaunty when the scene appears to call for menace, and at others just plain boring if the scene was meant to be actually funny (in that sarcastic, almost satirical way). The film could have worked at either being a comedy or a thriller, but the fusion of the two just doesn't work, and this failing has to fall at Williamson's door, it's as if Scream was all a fluke after all? The cast struggle with the meanderingly dull screenplay, only the stoic (and sexy) Helen Mirren salvaging any sort of dignity by realising early on that the core of the film calls for deft nastiness instead of outright villainy.\r\n\r\nPoor and practically unwatchable these days. 2/10",

      "synopsis": "Leigh Ann (Katie Holmes) is a high school student who wants to achieve top grades to become valedictorian. However, her grade in History class is threatened by her sadistic teacher, Mrs. Tingle (Helen Mirren). Mrs. Tingle has a special dislike for Leigh Ann and down-grades Leigh Ann's well-designed project. The teacher also stumbles upon Leigh Ann with the final exam, which had been stolen and planted in Leigh Ann's backpack without her consent, and threatens to have her expelled for it. Leigh Ann and her two friends, Luke (Barry Watson) and Jo Lynn (Marisa Coughlan), head to Mrs. Tingle's house that night and try to convince the teacher that Leigh Ann is innocent. Mrs. Tingle, however, does not listen. A physical struggle ensues and Mrs. Tingle is accidentally knocked unconscious. The students panic and tie Mrs. Tingle to her bed. Pretending to be Mrs. Tingle, Jo Lynn calls the school the next morning and feigns illness in order to buy themselves some time, but all are unsure of what they should do next. Mrs. Tingle eventually reveals that she hates Leigh Ann because Leigh Ann has the potential to leave their small town and experience life something Mrs. Tingle never got a chance to do but her honesty only furthers her captors' dislike of her. She also opines that Leigh Ann does not have the guts to do anything that will get her in trouble; in response, an angry and infuriated Leigh Ann kisses Luke and has sex with him on Mrs Tingle's couch. The next day at school, Jo Lynn ignores Leigh Ann because she had a crush a crush Leigh Ann had been aware of. A regretful Leigh Ann tries to make amends with Jo Lynn, but an admission that she'd had sex with Luke further infuriates Jo Lynn. Leigh Ann, Luke, and Jo Lynn decide to blackmail Mrs. Tingle by producing photographic evidence of her love affair with the school's gym teacher. Before they can enact their plot, however, Mrs. Tingle escapes from her bonds. After a fight at the top of the staircase, she seemingly falls to her death but then quickly recovers, scrambles to her feet, and picks up a crossbow. She fires it wildly, trying to hit Leigh Ann. Trudie Tucker (Liz Stauber) walks through the door, gets hit in the chest by the bolt, and appears to be dead just as Principal Potter (Michael McKean) arrives to check up on Mrs. Tingle. Leigh Ann forces Mrs. Tingle to tell everything that happened with her that she wanted Leigh Ann to fail, that she shot Trudie with the arrow, among other things. However, Trudie was protected by a thick textbook she was holding at her chest and was completely unharmed. Mrs. Tingle is fired, and the final scene of the film shows Leigh Ann being named valedictorian.",

         "This isn't a dreadful film, merely insipid. The plot is deeply flawed and implausible. It tries to be a number of genres and fails at each. It fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. It almost succeeds as science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, cute cherub face that she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is Helen Mirren. Her performance is fabulously nefarious and is (almost) worth suffering through the rest of it. Her ability to transmute from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range. Other than Marissa Coughlin's delightful Exorcist rendition, Mirren is the only reason to see this movie. A solid 3.0.",
         "In the UK, we're lucky enough to see Helen Mirren regularly on tv, especially as the lead in a crime drama series called Prime Suspect. In Teaching Mrs Tingle, she offers us a splendidly embittered bitch, teetering on the edge of caricature but always just - only just - on the stylish side of the thin line. The supporting cast of young actors, Barry Watson, Katie Holmes and Marisa Coughlan, are sexy and sassy - as the film is itself - and are good enough to suggest that in a few years time we'll all be watching this wondering why we didn't realise how good it was when it came out. The narrative's carefully managed by the writer (with none of the dreaded Dawson Creek verbal diahrroea), the photography and lighting are cleanly and sometime imaginatively done, and the dramatic thrills generate emotional excitement in a way that many so-called thrillers would like to emulate. Someone making this film was absolutely first rate at getting the best out of their team: maybe not everyone involved is going to do better later, and maybe this will turn out to have been their finest hour - but if you want to see a really enjoyable comedy thriller, then try this excellent movie.",
         "Teaching Mrs. Tingle, this was the movie I saw multiple times on HBO when it was released in 1999 and I couldn't get enough of this movie. I absolutely loved it, I think because I was graduating Jr. high at the time, I actually expected high school to be like this. True, it was a bit far fetched at the time, but still it was a lot of fun to watch. Who didn't fantasize about treating a teacher like this in high school, the one who absolutely gives you a hard time for no reason and just won't lighten up on you? OK, granted I don't think we wanted to play \"Mistress of Pain\" by tying our teachers up, but still it was a fun idea and this is just a fun movie to watch. Leigh Ann is a high school student who wants to achieve top grades to become valedictorian. However, her grade in History class is threatened by her sadistic teacher, Mrs. Tingle. Mrs. Tingle has a special dislike for Leigh Ann and down-grades Leigh Ann's well-designed project. The teacher also stumbles upon Leigh Ann with the final exam, which had been stolen and planted in Leigh Ann's backpack without her knowing, and threatens to have her expelled for it. Leigh Ann and her two friends, Luke and Jo Lynn, head to Mrs. Tingle's house that night and try to convince the teacher that Leigh Ann is innocent. Mrs. Tingle, however, does not listen. They try to grab Mrs. Tingle and she is accidentally knocked unconscious. The students panic and tie Mrs. Tingle to her bed. Pretending to be Mrs. Tingle, Jo Lynn calls the school the next morning and feigns illness in order to buy themselves some time, but all are unsure of what they should do next. Mrs. Tingle eventually reveals that she hates Leigh Ann because Leigh Ann has the potential to leave their small town and experience life, but her honesty only furthers her captors' dislike of her. She also opines that Leigh Ann has not got the guts to do anything that will get her in trouble; you know that that's not a good thing to say to the goodie goodie who needs adventure. While the movie has a bit of an unbelievable plot, it's just a nice escape and a good movie. It was funny, witty and intelligent. I loved Helen Merrin in this movie, she was just awesome as Mrs. Tingle, couldn't have been a better villain and was someone that you just loved to hate. Katie Holmes actually held herself up well and had good chemistry with then hottie of the day Barry Watson. The cast all together had good chemistry. To be honest I'm surprised this movie didn't get much notice after it's release, who knows if it might be a cult classic somewhere down the line, but I think it's a fun movie and if you get the chance to watch it, I'd suggest you take advantage. 7/10",
         "History teacher Mrs Tingle seems to have it in for student Leigh Ann Watson, who has her heart on achieving a writing school scholarship. She receives another low grade from Tingle, which doesn't help. When one of her classmates Luke steals the paper of the final history exams and pops it in her bag, Mrs. Tingle finds it sticking out. She threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it, but he's not available. So before she reports it the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal. However due to Tingle's stubbornness, that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting out. Wasn't fan of it when I first saw it, and after another viewing, I'm still not one. Writer Kevin Williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films; 'Scream (1996)', 'I Know What You did Last Summer (1997)', 'Scream 2 (1997)' and 'The Faculty (1998)'. He was riding the success (also not to forget the TV show 'Dawson's Creek), but this project would be the final bump. The difference there, compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay, he was also making his debut in directing. The strange thing though, was that I found his direction to be competently done, but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired. It seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight-out thriller, without making it gel. The script is cluttered with quick-wit, on-going gags, trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films, but the problem is that it's too watered-down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow. The fractured script had to be more strong and potent, since it's a small-scale production that feels like you're watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets. It tries to play mind games with the characters, but these moments are there to only serve the story's poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness. The film's ending takes the cake. Williamson's polished direction is sound, but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on. You eventually feel it after the halfway mark, and it shows up how minor the story is. The performances are tolerable enough, although if it weren't for Helen Mirren's classy, icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as Mrs. Tingle and a buoyant Marisa Coughlan, we would have been stuck watching a vapid goody-to-shoes Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his slacker part and Molly Ringwald has a lesser role. The soundtrack packs enough energy, but I found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choices. Watchable, but mechanical all round.",
         "I hate it. And I hate it all the more because its meant to be light and inconsequential, and it is, but yet still provokes in me such nauseating and violent ire. Its a waste of my bile. But, it is so catastrophically stupid and badly written I just have to collect my thoughts. 1. Why didn't the stupid male teen lummox admit fault as soon as Tingle took the stolen test out of stupid Holmes' bag? 2. After agreeing to just tell the truth why did they send female teen actress B go to Tingle's door and proceed to just lie? Second obvious chance for male teen lummox to admit all wrongdoing goes abegging. 3. Why do any of said lummoxes fail to listen to their own ideas?. Tingle is manipulative, don't listen to her, she's trying to promote disharmony within our group. Stop listening to her. Its a ruse. Don't let her get to you... Whats that Mrs Tingle?.... Really? 4. Why does being upset by Tingle (see 3) drive Holmes to have presumably unprotected sex with irredeemably guilty male teen lummox? 5. Why does she even want to fornicate with said male teen lummox? To paraphrase... Holmes (to Lummox) - \"There's an unguarded innocent woman tied upstairs, we're probably all going to prison for a long time and its all your fault, you have no scruples or charisma, my accomplice and best friend who has (somehow) always been in love with you has now fled the crime scene in a jealous rage because she's been tricked (see 3) into thinking we've slept together. Lets sleep together, that's made me horny\". 6. And why doesn't this firmly establish Holmes as a colossally stupid, horribly callous b**ch? 7. Why does illegally changing not only HER grade, but unjustifiably sabotaging someone else's grade not only further reinforce Holmes as being a horrible callous b**ch? 8. Since Holmes is explicitly established as a horrible person, does that not make Tingle the protagonist by default? Where is the tension in the prospect of Holmes getting caught? 9. Mrs Tingle has escaped and is on the phone in the living room. Holmes sneaks into the MIDDLE of the SAME room and stands there. Has Tingle seen her? I think she's gotten away with it.... no, wait. 10. One lummox screams \"RUN!\" when crossbow aimed at Mrs Tingle is found to be minus the arrow. Run? From a 60 year old woman? Run where? Run WHY? What does running solve? \"She's got my ankle! We're all going to die!\" scream the three healthy teens. (Clue - Tingle is a superhuman cannibal). 11. Tingle has been assaulted, threatened, kidnapped, blackmailed and tormented in her own home for numerous days. Don't call the police, this is a matter for the principal. 12. Tingle's legally justified retaliation results in nobody getting hurt. The simple question of \"whats been going on here?\" is fortunately not raised by anyone ever again and thus all captors are absolved of all crimes. Holmes gets her fraudulent award, all betrayal between friends is never spoken of again and they all live happily ever after. These are only the larger and more thematic ones. Everything, every minute detail of this film is deeply and profoundly stupid, unjustified. illogical and unlikable. I thought this would be cathartic but i just feel empty inside.",
         "I will have to disagree with many comments on this movie saying that it was only a bomb. I thought this movie was quite interesting, surely not a great one, but good. The high point of this movie, in fact, is Helen Mirren. I was quite impressed with her inspiring performance - it kind of reminded me of Kathy Bates in \"Misery\". It is quite rare to see such a great performance like Helen Mirren's in an horror/suspense movie and this is the main reason why I have decided to comment on \"Teaching Mrs. Tingle\".",
         "Fred Williamson's directorial debut is a movie targeted for teen agers. This comedy, with black overtones, is not a total failure. The story line is not the best asset of the film, which presents us with a situation that doesn't go anywhere, as it brings a cruel side on the young people in the story that doesn't ring true. Mrs. Tingle, a tyrannical history professor, clearly dislikes most of the students in her senior class. Leigh Ann, an earnest young woman needs whatever help she can get from her teacher in order to get the scholarship she so desperately needs. It is clear Leigh Ann will never get any sympathy from Mrs. Tingle. The situation deteriorates when Luke, one of the guys in Mrs. Tingle's class gets hold of the final exam and shows it to Leigh Ann and Joe Lynn, her best friend who has a crush on the young man. Mrs. Tingle happens to walk on them and discovers it on Leigh Ann's bag. The chances for the scholarship, and the possible for an expulsion from school, are almost assured. Instead of confessing, Luke, doesn't even open his mouth. He lets Mrs. Tingle walk out vowing she'll do whatever to have them punished. Expusion is a possibility for the trio. So what do they do? They go to Mrs. Tingle's home wanting to make amends, but she is unmoved. One thing leads to another as they try to get her to change her mind about the theft of the exam, something she will never even consider. The best thing in the movie is Helen Mirren. She is perfect as the lonely teacher who loves to mock and ridicule the young people under her. She is a frustrated woman who has no life, but who loves to make fun of others because basically she doesn't tolerate the fact that some other people are happy. Katie Holmes, plays Leigh Ann. She is not as effective here as in some other films. Barry Watson and Marisa Caughlan are Leigh's friends. Jeffrey Tambor only has one scene in the film, but he makes the best out of it. Molly Ringwald, Miichael McKean and Vivica Fox are seen in supporting roles. \"Teaching Mrs. Tingle\" doesn't break new ground, but it keeps the viewer involved in it.",
         "I have now watched this movie at least 30 times on the movie channels and decided that I like this movie more each time. Carefully watching these young actors portraying their characters, they have achieved their talents in making one believe they are not acting. It gets funnier each time and with each time, I realize what a cruel person Tingle might actually be. Just because Mirren is a superb actress doesn't make her a likable one in this film. She is however, a perfect teacher on how to be a spiteful, hateful, mean-spirited,jealous and power abusing menace to society if you need a teacher. It is that kind of callous hearted abuse and lack of self discipline in separating personal feelings and power that makes someone like her so dangerous and drives many otherwise decent human beings into desperate measures. Which is one of the keys to this films plot. It is, as Leigh Ann accuses, the teachers and role models to blame if the youth of today do not achieve skills to being better human beings and with Tingle as an example, what tools would a youngster faced with such a situation have learned to resolve any better? Tingles morally criminal behavior leads to actual criminal behavior of these minors trying to convince her to do the right thing from the start. Her position to do whatever she wants, right or wrong is what causes these teens to resort to desperate measures to protect themselves against such abuse which is not unlike many other positions adults force upon children. Playing by ear, with each plea for Tingle to cooperate and her refusal, these teens must plot to save whatever they can. It was Tingle who had malice from beginning to end, the kids just played the game changing the rules from plan A to B when all failed. If not for Jo Lynn and her adaptive humor, this film could have had controversial overtones. Jo Lynn was the tie that binds these characters together and her lighthearted, carefree humor was refreshing to the plot. She illuminated the meaning of a forgiving and loyal friend. Oddly, this was one of those feel good films for me.",
         "This adaptation of the Steve Balderson film is also very similar to \"9 to 5,\" but lacks the warmth of that film and the stylish excitement of Pep Squad. They should have kept the title \"Killing Mrs. Tingle\" instead of changing it to \"Teaching...\" I think that was pretty weak. Overall, writing is fair, but the story is superficially shallow. Metaphors and real meaning needed to be here.",
         "One of the funniest movies I have seen in ages. Excellent cast, particularly Mirren as Mrs. Tingle. The supporting cast are not far behind. For some reason it did badly at the box office, possibly because of the subject area. However I would make it a must see movie."
