         "This remarkable film traces with an almost clinical precision the last two days of a terminally desperate man. He is a former Parisian dandy, estranged from his wife due to his drinking problem and who, after having just managed to clear himself up in a clinic, finds no reason in going back to society to continue his life. His decision is already taken, but he gives himself a last chance of trying to establish a meaningful connection with the surrounding bourgeois environment by meeting his old friends and former lovers. Is it a last cry for help or a final farewell to a way of life which he finds phony, hollow and meaningless? This esoteric and highly personal journey is masterly handed by the versatile Louis Malle, who perhaps has created his masterpiece. Framing, editing and most of all acting are calibrated to perfection in order to convey a holistic sense of existential despair, the portrait of a man who feels that he has spent his life waiting for something that hasn't appeared and is not worth any longer the wait.",
         "This is a mesmerising film about suicide as a rational way out. Ronet is wonderful in the role, sweetly sad, boyishly charming, tragically self-aware. His loving, well-meaning friends he visits on the way to the final \"checking-out\" are an interesting study and their inability to connect with Ronet or perceive where he's heading is poignant. For me, the best Louis Malle ever. The choice of music is great as well.",
         "One extraordinary feature of this film is what I would call a \"filter\". Right from the start, the viewer knows that Alain is hurriedly (yet half-heartedly) searching for something that would give him the will to live, otherwise he will commit suicide. This extremely simple premise leads to extraordinary effects: the everyday happenings, which would seem neutral or even pleasant in any other circumstance, now fill us with disgust. Through the filter of Alain's eyes, we perceive the everyday reality as hopeless and empty of any worthwhile purpose. The author's message: you should apply that filter to your own life. But who has the guts to do it? I know I don't.",
         "\"The Fire Within\" (French, 1963): Directed by Louis Malle, scored by Eric Satie. This is a perfect visual reason to use black and white with tons of gray. It is two days in the life of a young, popular man who has returned to his acquaintances, friends and ex-lovers, after vanishing into a program for alcoholics\u0085a program he found comforting, and did NOT want to leave. He searches through his relationships for a reason to continue his life, whether as-is or anew\u0085but overriding any thoughts of the future is his current state of total depression. His friends continued their lives during his absence, they continue their fast-paced, challenging repartee during his visits, and they will clearly continue after his leaving. \"The Fire Within\" is a quiet, observational film, interrupted only for conversations that seem to have substance, yet offer no solutions. It has one goal, and meets it very well.",
         "Louis Malle is on record as finding this the first of his early films with which he was fully satisfied. I choose not to argue with him although I didn't find too much wrong with the others. What is indisputable here is that director and leading actor (Maurice Ronet) were in complete accord with both being entitled to pat themselves on the back. Though based on a celebrated novel Malle has embellished this with his own touches and succeeded against all the odds in making Paris empty and vacuous - as seen, of course, through the jaded eyes of the protagonist - which is quite a trick if anybody asks you. It's not so much Paris as the people in it, of course, people who are all good friends of the protagonist and none of whom can persuade him that life really is worth living. It's a fine ensemble piece dominated by a central role and if technically - in terms of when it was made - a product of the New Wave then certainly one of the more accomplished and professional of the genre. Should really be on everyone's list.",
         "For Le Feu Follet (often translated as the Fire Within), Louis Malle brings his two Lift to the Scaffold stars together again. Maurice Ronet gives a towering performance as Alain Leroy, a suicidal ex-alcoholic. Jeanne Moreau plays a supporting role, a bohemian art-lover from Leroy's playboy past. They meet in a scene that embodies Leroy's isolation. She is in a small art gallery of Kadinsky's work when he attracts her attention from the street. He tries to speak to her through the thick pane of glass and she also lowers her glasses to look at him. Although she is a breath of fresh air compared to many of his old friends, he castigates her and her arty friend Urcel for their love of art, calling his paintings 'empty alibis'. Leroy is not only saying goodbye to all his friends. He is saying goodbye to the excuses that make life worth living. For the past few years, Alain has been holed up in an expensive clinic in Versailles. His ex-wife (in New York) pays the bills and sends a friend, Lydia, to see how he's doing. In the film's opening scene, they are making love. As he stares at her, we too are invited to enjoy looking at Lydia. The profound searching, questioning, gaze and dialogue also pulls us into seeing things from Alain's viewpoint. This remarkable feat of interiorisation sets the movie apart within the first few minutes. It's going to be one of those deep reflective European films. Art-house joy and mainstream tedium. But if your taste is with the former, this is one of Louis Malle's best. Le Feu Follet might easily be compared to Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas, in which Nicholas Cage plays a suicidal alcoholic in the best performance of his career to date. Alain Leroy, like Cage's character, also seeks solace in women, first begging Lydia to stay and then trying to latch on to Solange, another ex. But Le Feu Follet seems more true to life. The women are sensible enough to avoid him for anything more than a carefully time-limited interaction. They are not drawn into his world for more than a brief moment. With almost Godard-like intensity, the film bombards us with quasi-philosophical arguments, however inappropriate. The inmates at the clinic debate Aristotle over dinner. Alain's conversation is peppered with the sort of epigrams one might expect of an Oxbridge alumni fed on classics. He debates respective approaches to life with his old friend Dubourg, an Egyptologist who has exchanged the fire of youth for family life, contentment and stability. They debate the worth of his new-found leisurely approach. To Alain, it lacks fire. And Dubourg's justifications are ultimately rejected by Alain as 'mediocre certainties.' It is a diatribe against the bourgeoisie. On the one hand, Alain has been cured. He is no longer an alcoholic. But life within the clinic has a nurturing simplicity. Alain knows that, once ejected, he will relapse. If incipient depression were not the more real problem, everything else might be easy. But no-one, even his doctors, seems to recognise that. But if le Feu Follet is such a convincing character study \u0096 and yet one of such hopelessness \u0096 we maybe should ask what is the point? Perhaps it is the mental effort we expend in trying to see a way out. What is wrong with Leroy's viewpoint, intellectually? He shows the emptiness of all other approaches. When someone suggests he do something mundane that he had once sought \u0096 opening a shop \u0096 he is able to point out that he is deeply in debt. His desire for truth, for honesty, for the fire inside, is moving. We really do have to work hard to say what is wrong with it. To me, the answer is that his fire is unformulated. It might be obvious to him, and the film makes it intuitively obvious to the viewer, but that is not the same as stating it in more viable, rigorous terms. It is almost as if Alain's fire dies before it has fired him up. Take Schopenhauer, Freud, famous pessimists. They fashioned their 'fire' into a coherent body of work. Alain could have used his latter days in the clinic to plan a rationale with which to embrace the world outside on his own terms. But his fire was too much of the Will o' the Wisp variety (another of the film's international titles). Yet his hedonism is certainly appealing. I watched Alain and Lydia inhale their smokes after their hot sex. I thought back to the time when I used cigarettes and rather enjoyed the sensation . . .",
         "Le Feu Follet or \"Will o'the wisp\" as it can be translated into English is one of the most important philosophical films made by the great master of French cinema Louis Malle.It is based on a book written by Pierre Drieu la Rochelle who was influenced by Dadaism. Although this film talks of a difficult albeit dark theme of suicide the film's overall mood is not at all gloomy. This is because there are plenty of scenes infused with day to day humor.The film is about a protagonist who has lost all interest in life.Maurice Ronet,a major French film star of the sixties plays the lead role.He is a sort of celebrity among his circle of socialites and he is fed up of their useless company.The film portrays the last days of a person suffering from a drug habit.In some ways this film is an attack on middle class or French bourgeoisie.Although the protagonist is a part of it,he nevertheless makes vain attempts to untangle himself from it.If a separate genre of suicide films is formed, this film will easily find a proud place in that category.",
         "Beautifully detailed black and white study of a man looking for a reason to go on living and not really finding it. Updates the excellent 1920s novel on which it is based to the 1960s without sacrificing anything of the former's timeless relevance. To give a (very) rough point of reference, it is something of a subdued Left Bank version of \"La Dolce Vita\", although Malle's film has none of the frantic burlesque episodes of LDV. Rather, the feel of the film is consistently weary and melancholic. Poetic and moving, it's an existentialist classic.",
         "Malle's Lift to the Scaffold may have started the French New Wave but this feels even more like it (to me). This film is definitely not going to be every ones tea. I personally love films where the director takes his time to investigate something simple and does it by exploring everyday life. Spoilers!!! Is it depressing? Yes (and then some), but i don't think that is the point of the film. It tries to explore why someone would want to kill him/her self. What drives people to the edge? And Malle answers that quite convincingly. He manages to show us how the main character, Alain Leroy, sees the world. How happy friendly gathering look empty and pointless to Alain. He just can't connect. He is not part of this world. He has in a way died long time ago. The suicide is just an official statement of what has already happened. The scariest part of this film is that it makes you wonder whether Alain's vision of the world is correct. Is life maybe really like he sees it? I for one hope not and if it is then I don't want to know about it. Let me live in ignorance. But the film did get me thinking about my goals in life and where I was heading. Music is usually so perfect in Malle's films and this is no exception. He could not have used better music than Gnossienne No.1 by Erik Satie. Simple, like the film it self, but still endlessly sad and deep (again, like the film it self). I really liked this film. It is not for everyone, and I'm sure many would complain that nothing happened in it. And if you only look at the surface then they would be right, but this film is not about the surface.",
         "This is really one of the best Louis Malle films, and one of the best French films, thanks to the excellent novel, the directing, and the actors, especially Maurice Ronet. He is a real good actor and we can see through him, a really special role. And even if Louis Malle made some extraordinary films like Au revoir les enfants, this one is a masterpiece. Please see this great film."
