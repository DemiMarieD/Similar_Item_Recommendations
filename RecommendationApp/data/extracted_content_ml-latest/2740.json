         "After three years in a coma, Amanda Hollins awakens and tells her son, John. To destroy her life experiments and any information found in her secluded old house. He heads there with his girlfriend, some work colleagues and one of his mother's admirers. They eventually discover more then what they bargain for, as some of his mother's genetic engineered creations run amok. I thought I've seen this one before, but I was wrong. This modest combination of 50's sci-fi / horror goes onto deliver a undervalued oddity, with a tip-top ensemble cast and sure-handling from dual directors Jeffrey Obrow and Stephen Carpenter. Suspense is lacking because the minimal story is just too typical and shredded with loopholes, but it's the surprisingly efficient make-up effects, which are over-the-top and horrifically creative that makes for a pleasurable treat. The excessive use of this icky business in some wicked (and at times silly) set pieces is the film's only real imaginative bone. A quick tempo, builds up after a slow opening and the shocks are well placed for maximum effect. Be it a laugh or a gasp. The material mostly plays it with a straight face, with slight slabs of humour and Rod Steiger's small meaty turn. The composed performances (with Steiger being the exception) are reasonably good from the cast. David Allen Brooks is likable in his steadfast delivery and the ravishing Amanda Pays shines in her shifty portrayal. Talia Balsam gives hearty support and Peter Frechette diverts. The classy Kim Hunter also gets some minor scenes as Amanda Hollins. Obrow and Carpenter's directorial style is systematically sturdy without an ounce of any visual flourishes. The look of the film generates a gloomy air, mainly due to Steven Carpenter's murky photography and dim lighting. David Newman's moody, understated music score is fairly unnoticeable.",
         "One of the secrets is that the film does not have all that much of a plot to it. So do not try to analyze it, or figure out what is wrong with the picture. It is a \"b\" movie to be sure, but a somewhat good \"b\" movie as it were. The story has a son trying to fulfill his mother's wish of destroying her life's work at the home she used to live with, she had just woken from a coma. So the son is off along with some science type friends to look into the mystery's surrounding his mother's request. Surprisingly when you write it out it does sound like a good plot and maybe it is not all that bad, but for the most part once they arrive at the house the film becomes your typical horror movie about monsters. Though I do love the setting of the old house and the basement stuff, the movie kind of reminds me of a combination of two Stuart Gordon movies \"Re-animator\" and \"From Beyond\" without being as good as either of them. Still the monsters look pretty good and there are some rather good kills, the plot is rather ignored after a certain point, but with death and mayhem I can live without plot. I would like to see this movie again someday as it has been awhile since I last saw it, but from what I remember not the best movie in the world, but it kept me entertained.",
         "The gruesome special make-up effects are the best part of this overall well made movie. Not a Oscar-winning film, but for a film of it's budget, it was pretty good. And yes, Amanda Pays transformation into a Fish-like creature was pretty cool. The \"watermelon\" scene is really funny.Not bad for a low budget.",
         "Dr. John Hollins is called to the hospital bed of his mother. She advises him to finish the science projects she started involving something what seems to be a long lost brother of Johns. When she dies, John and a few of his colleagues and friends drive up to her old house to clean up the place and to find out more about her science achievements. But, a horrible monster dwells around the place. This creature (referred to as Johns brother because it sprung out of his tissue) It's some sort of disgusting fish-creature since his \"blood\" contains a lot of hydrocyanine (or however that is written) John and the rest want to destroy it asap, but an old colleague of John's mother wants the creature to be his. I must admit this film was rather a pleasant surprise. Sure it stole some elements of classics like Alien and even a bit of \"The island of Dr. Moreau. But overall, I didn't care much. What is original these days ? It's much better than I expected it to be. I was familiar with the earlier work of director Stephen Carpenter...I saw The Dorm that Dripped Blood and was angry for a week because I wasted time to that crap. So, in that theory, the Kindred is an improvement of 250 %. A lot of credit has to go to the actors, though. The leading role is played by David Allan Brooks. I'm not familiar with this guys career but his haircut sure is impressive. This film also stars Amanda Pays !! There, I just gave you an extra reason to see it. She's gorgeous as always and that British accent of hers makes her one of the sexiest horror females in history. I also noticed a blond babe who's face I've only seen before in Revenge of the Nerds...I don't know if that's a good thing. And I saved the best for last...Rod Steiger is in it !! This great actor, who recently deceased, plays the role of the evil scientist. He over-acts very much, but in a good way. He's great ! The part of Johns ' mother is played by Kim \"Planet of the Apes\" Hunter. That's a very interesting Trivia element, but her role is rather brief. The kindred is a nice attempt to make an enjoyable over the top monster film. It's got a few major holes in the plot (like for example the chick who got killed in the road accident...she never get mentioned again and HOW did Anthony return home ???) but you'll forgive the film for it. At least I did. Enough gore to satisfy the more extravagant horror lovers too, by the way.",
         "The Kindred is just a monster movie-no more, no less. While not being Rod Steiger's finest moment (or wig), it does offer up a slim bit of originality. Steiger plays a mad scientist (what other kind are there?) who is searching for a genetically altered monster, Anthony. Also searching for Anthony are a group of 20-something medical students and one of them could be related him; Hence the title. Then it becomes a formulaic slasher movie with the kids being attacked one by one. It's pretty much downhill from there. The scenes in Steiger's lab are the eeriest and the movie should have spent more time there. The climax stands out and the acting is not bad considering two Academy Award winning \"screen legends\" were conned into starring in it.",
         "Okay, first and foremost, let me take my pants off. Just kidding... No, First and foremost, this film will delight you ONLY if you are a real fan of films described in my summary above. It is ULTRA low budget, but you really have to admire how well they did with what they had. I thought for very low cost creature effects, the creators / directors of the film did an excellent job in making them as believable as possible and actually truly scary at times. You could tell that the directors had a nice natural sense of how to visualize what they wanted; for example, without giving too much away, just the simple scene with the little guy in the jar was really quite good. When compared to MANY other similar scenes in Horror or even Goofy, NOT-Serious Horror (A La 'GREMLINS', for example) where you would use similar effects, I really felt that they made it very believable and lifelike, which went a LONG way in involving and truly immersing you more in the film. Sure, as some others have stated here, there are some pretty Cheeeeeeezy moments, but even compared to MOST of the Horror crap that has come out during that time and even within, say, ten years of this being made, I think this one very much holds it's own in drawing the audience in and creating a decent level of tension. There are also a nice twist or two that adds to the entertainment value of the movie. One transformation scene, which I WON'T go into because I do not want to enter Spoiler territory, was honestly quite effective and well done, despite some of the scornful comments from a couple of other reviewers here. The acting is nothing to get too excited about; we don't see very much from the veterans here, except the usual Rod Steiger getting worked up to either an orgasm or heart attack, take your choice... I personally liked Brad though; he had a rather entertaining personality. Everyone else was adequate; the British girl was decent, of course the accent (to us easily impressed Americans) always helps. I'm NOT trying to say that this is by ANY reach of the imagination an 'ALIEN', 'SESSION 9', or 'EVENT HORIZON', believe me; but for the modest intent of the film and for PRECISELY what it is, it comes across surprisingly well. So, like I mentioned before, IF you are indeed a fan of these kinds of films, then you should have a lot of fun watching it...",
         "***SPOILERS*** Grossed out horror movie involving world renowned, but somewhat deranged, Geneticist Dr. Phillip Llyod, Rod Steiger, who's into creating clones of human beings who despite having the exact genetic material in their DNA don't look anything like each other. It was Dr. Llyod's assistant Dr. Amanda Hollins, Kim Hunter, who in fact discovered the metamorphosis like operation but unlike the totally crazed Dr. Llyod knew just how dangerous it was for all humanity and tried to stop it by destroying all the papers she had written on it over the years. Recovering for a massive heart-attack, which she later died from, Dr. Hollins begs her son John, David Allen Brooks, to burn the notes and papers on her secret experiment before it's too late. Too late in stopping John's genetic twin Anthony, who in fact looks nothing like him, coming out into the open and killing everything, human and animal life, that he or it comes in contact with! It's at Dr. Hollins country home where she conducted her experiment in human genetics that her Son John and his friends planned to spend the weekend not realizing the dangers they they were soon to be facing. Anthony makes his long awaited and grand appearance hiding inside a watermelon that he uses as cover in attacking and devouring one of John's friends Neil, Burki Z, while she was driving home to celebrate her parents 35th wedding anniversary! It takes a lot of convincing but by the time that Anthony finally reveals himself it's almost too late to stop him or it. The both mad and cagey Dr. Llyod had secretly planted among John's friends a spy, who's dependent on Dr. Llyod's medication, who does everything to stymie John in finally bringing an end to his genetic brother Anthony. The sad part is that he or she in doing Dr. Llyod's bidding becomes Anthony 1st victim! Despite being on the screen for less then ten minutes Academy Award Winner actor Rod Steiger steals the acting honors as the totally out of his head Dr. Phillip Llyod. Dr. Llyod in trying to keep his and the late Dr. Hollis invention from being cooked down to a blob of Vaseline tried desperately to stop John & Co. from liquefying it only to end up joining the \"Thing\" in the very depths of hell from where it came from! :The by then totally destroyed Dr. Hollis secret laboratory. But it's in fact Anthony, who looks like a combination of a deep sea squid and cicada beetle, who's the real star of the movie. This yucky and gooey monstrosity is about the grosses thing even seen in a horror movie and makes every minute of its on screen appearances count! To the point where in the end you actually end up feeling sorry for it despite all the death and destruction it caused!",
         "A young man returns to the family home following his mothers death. While there (with a group of his friends of course) he goes looking for her diary that she has hidden somewhere in the house that explains all about the brother named Anthony that he never knew he had, however as he soon finds out, meeting Anthony (He's not human go figure!) will be no family celebration of long lost siblings as the creature his mother helped create starts picking them all off one by one, while an evil doctor seeks to save it (of course!) & may pose more of a threat then the \"Brother\" the hero never knew he had. THE KINDRED is a film I watched as a kid many years ago & just recently after close to twenty years was able to see again & while I found the film to be interesting in parts, it overall failed to excite me in the same way when I first saw it (but then again what horror movie isn't scary & effective when you're not legally old enough to see them anyway?) I will give it some points though, the acting & directing are fairly good here, as is the monster effects, but the film never really reaches the levels of suspense & tension it should & the film tends to drag on in places with an ending that leaves far to many survivors. Might be worth a look on a rainy day or if you have nothing better to do, it's not a bad film, just nothing all that memorable. **1/2 stars",
         "Slight horror movie from 1987, features some good special effects and good horror bits, but is hampered with hollow characters and a slack pace. '80's horror fans might wanna check this out for a single view. A woman is killed by a watermelon monster while driving a car and Rod Steiger gives us another staggering performance, this time as a mad scientist. The story starts out good, but the second half looses it's footing, and too little of the monster is seen. Originally I saw this on the USA Network about 15 years ago and just saw it for the second time the other night because I found this in a video store for sale for two bucks. Not great, but not bad. Two Stars.",

At the funeral John meets Melissa, who claims to be his mothers biggest fan. Together with some of John's friends they go to Amanda's house, but none are prepared for what they find there. Scary film with an intense opening sequence and a good cast, especially Steiger and Pays. It also features some good nasty gross out special effects, especially the watermelon scene and the finale. A very underrated horror film. The scenes in Steiger's lab are the eeriest and the movie should have spent more time there. That's right, don't watch on a full stomach and just try not to eat while watching it. Rated R for Graphic Violence and Profanity."
