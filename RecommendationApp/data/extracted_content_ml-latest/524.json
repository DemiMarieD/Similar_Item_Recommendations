      "synopsis": "Rudy Ruettiger ( Sean Astin) grows up in a Catholic, working class family that loves Notre Dame football. He does not have the grades, the size or the talent to get into his beloved school so he follows his brothers and father into work at the steel plant. After his twenty-second birthday his best friend Pete ( Christopher Reed) who always believed in him dies in an accident. Rudy then realizes that it is now or never to follow his life-long dream to play for the Fighting Irish. Despite fear of failure from his father ( Ned Beatty) and girlfriend ( Lili Taylor) he leaves to pursue his goal. Showing up is not enough to get him into the university, so with the encouragement of a priest ( Robert Prosky), he enrolls in Holy Cross Junior College. There he gets help from a tutor ( Jon Favreau) who helps him deal with his reading disability and finally get good grades. He works on the maintenance crew ( Charles S. Dutton). Finally, Rudy gets accepted and upon transferring in to the school, he gets a chance as a \"tackling dummy\" for the team for two years. Encouraged by his persistence and spunk, Rudy inspires the team and is allowed to dress for one game by the coach ( Jason Miller), where he is triumphantly carried off the field by his fellow teammates. The story is based on the life of Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger.",

         "This movie was dubbed a football version of \"Rocky\" except for one exception --it is an actual true story!! If you can watch \"Rudy\" and not have a lump in your throat during several scenes, especially the ending, then you are a hard to please critic!! This movie deserved much better than the 7.1 than the \"critics\" gave it. Sean Austin did a magnificent job playing overachieving Rudy and for those who ridiculed the fact that he only played a few seconds at the end of a lopsided game missed the whole point of the story. Rudy's dream was to play football at Notre Dame and earn everyone's respect (including his doubting family). With his lack of talent for both academics and athletics, the mere fact that he was even admitted into Notre Dame after struggling so hard to get good grades at Holy Cross (the Junior College Rudy went to in an attempt to prove himself worthy of Notre Dame since he had been out of High School for several years and made poor grades in High School.) He overcame his learning problems that had held him back in High School and this was a monumental achievement in itself. The scene where he was finally admitted into Notre Dame on his final attempt (he had been rejected 3 earlier times) was uplifting indeed. Rudy overcame reading difficulties thru hard work much the same way he overcame his lack of size to make the Notre Dame's football team --thru a gut-busting, never quit attitude. His teammates were so impressed with his attitude that they forced the coach (Dan Devine, a real jerk in the movie) to dress him for the final game. The final scene where the entire stadium was hollering \"Rudy, Rudy, Rudy\" in an effort to get him into the game at the end was spine-tingling! Rudy busting thru the line to sack the quarterback at the end of the game and get carried off the field with the stadium going nuts chanting his name---Well, movies don't get any better than this. And all this really happened!! Amazing how one of the best stories ever told in movies involve an \"average Joe\" who achieved his dream thru hard work----a Horatio Alger story indeed--10 out of 10 definitely ---For some of you \"critics\" that rated it worse than a \"7\" --you should take a class in movie critic reviews --you definitely would flunk my class if you gave this one a worse score than that!!",
         "Rudy is a story that pulls at every heart string and emotions you possibly could have. Why? Well it doesn't have to do with the actors, though they are all great. It doesn't have to do with the filming, it isn't what draws us in. It is one thing. The one major fact. The True Story. To watch and see how Rudy overcomes every obstacle he faces. To see how Rudy truly triumphs, even if it isn't the best possible success for someone, for Rudy it is everything. This movie is a story that teaches a lesson. It is about football, but it is about believing. Never giving up. Always giving it your all. Rudy is a movie that gives us something to believe in. Believe.",
         "This is a great film about going for your dreams and never giving up. No matter who tells you that you can't do it, no matter how unlikely the chances are, no matter what, make sure you go for your dreams and do everything that you can make them come true. Sean Astin delivers one of his best performances to date. He plays the character of Rudy Ruettiger perfectly! He was an excellent choice for the role and he deserves a great deal of credit for his work (as does the true life Rudy). The rest of the cast was quite good as well; Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty, Lili Taylor, Charles Dutton, Robert Prosky, and Vince Vaughn (in one of his first roles). All of the supporting cast was excellent. If you like inspirational movies, or just movies about football (although there is much more to this movie than just football), then I highly recommend you see this film. I hope that you enjoy it. Thanks for reading, -Chris",
         "If this movie doesn't get you motivated, then something is wrong with you. This movie proves that good things happen to people who work hard and don't except the circumstances they are dealt. I've seen this movie more than 30 times in my life, and i still cant get through the end of this movie without getting tears in my eyes. Another thing this movie teaches you is to listen to the people in your life who believe in you and want you to succeed, don't listen to the people who want you to fail and constantly remind you that your going to fail. \"The best revenge is success.\" One of my favorite quotes comes from this movie as well, when the coach dan devine tells rudy and the rest of the team that \"Nobody, and i mean nobody, comes into our house and pushes us around.\"",
         "To be completely honest, I was actually impressed with this film. It is sweet, but there is an honesty and a strong sense of realism at the heart of this film, which to me, provides the base of its appeal. \"Rudy\", unlike the majority of films about athletes, paints a picture of the real everyman (basically, the jock who isn't a jock) and it does so in a way that is plausible from start to finish. Working hard, eating, breathing and sleeping the game does not mean that you will wind up the star quarterback. Rudy's struggles are genuine: his family is poor and has never sent anyone to college, his grades are sub-par (largely the result of an undiagnosed learning disorder), he can't afford his junior college let alone Notre Dame and Rudy is, at best,only a moderate athlete. It is in the way that he overcomes these obstacles (not to mention the beautiful performance by Sean Astin) which provides the refreshing realism which is at core of this film. \"Rudy\" is what sports are really all about.",
         "RUDY is the greatest football movie of all time. Wait, did I say 'football movie'? I meant movie. Period. Between the gut-wrenching acting by Sean Astin, tear-jerking moments of the climax, the miraculous true story of a short man fighting to make his lifelong dreams come true, you'll be rooting for Rudy throughout the film. Rudy's dream is a selfless act of triumph that can do nothing but good for the entire human race. You can't help but ride right along with Rudy for the roller-coaster of emotions that ensues, leading up to the greatest moment of his life, a moment that will resonate in the very fiber of your being. This movie shows that dreams really can come true. If you put your mind (and body) to it, and if you have a big enough heart, you too can accomplish anything! After watching this movie, I was inspired to try just that much harder at everything I do, in hopes of one day becoming half the man that Rudy is. This movie is genuine, heart-felt emotion that will touch the inner depths of your soul. From the biggest person to the smallest, one and all will be reaching for the tissues after enjoying, nay, living, every moment of this film. Warning: don't watch the movie alone. You'll want the extra arms in the room for when you're hugging each other in celebration, and an extra voice erupting with cheers for the single greatest movie hero of all time: RUDY.",
         "I found the movie to be inspirational, a little cliched and always interesting. Sean Astin made me believe in the character he played and I also enjoyed Charles S. Dutton. You know how the movie will end, unless you were born yesterday, but its still satisfying and I wasn't ashamed to shed a tear....",
         "One of my favorite football movies of all time, this film follows in the long tradition of great sports movies which can uplift the spirit through means other than winning the big game and getting the girl or some other typical Hollywood convention. The music, cinematography and acting was excellent in this film, especially considering the terrible film choices Sean Astin had before embarking on this movie. While this was really an homage to Notre Dame football, a person could really look at Rudy and see a little of themselves inside the relatively small man. Charles Dutton had one of the greatest speeches in the history of sports cinema, and he should have gained more notoriety for his performance in this film.",
         "This is a movie for everyone who ever felt like the little person, overlooked by those who were bigger or more popular. \"Rudy\" had kind of a lame title for a sports movie, and i remember the first time I saw a preview of it, I was totally moved and involved by the scenes and then guffawed aloud at the end when the announcer intoned, \"RUDY.\" That set the rest of the theater laughing too, so imagine my surprise when i saw it a couple months later and it was a 10 out of 10 in my book. I'm not even a sports fan but this movie got me. It shows the power of faith to get by with any frustration in life, the performances are great and it's a shame that Sean Astin had to wait eight years to get another great break with \"Lord of the Rings.\" His is a worldclass performance in this film, see it as it is one of the most inspiring films you'll ever see.",
         "One of the most wonderful things a film can do is be so moving and triumphant that it makes you cry. You aren't crying because Bambi mother's was killed or because Jack Dawson went down with the ship; instead you are identifying with the power of the human spirit. Rudy is an ordinary man, you could even argue that he is less than ordinary in regards to his physical tributes and academic capacity, but he achieves an extraordinary feat. He leads with his heart, even when he doesn't fully understand why he is putting himself through such perils. He seeks to prove himself to others, to all those who doubted him and he thrives to achieve his goal for those few who believed in him. And eventually, when he tested in his darkest moment, his epipany comes: he needs to do this for himself. Sean Astin is brilliant in his role as Notre Dame's most famous would-be underachiever. He plays Rudy with such dedication and determination that it is impossible not to be impressed by his perseverance, inspired by his courage, and touched by his passion for the game. The story is wonderfully told by director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo. Jerry Goldsmith's score and Oliver Wood's cinematography truly capture the power and beauty of the story. This film is an incredible achievement. It touches its viewers right where it counts: in the heart. And the film has its own emotional centre, its own eloquent theme which everyone can identify with. We all have dreams, but we don't all strive to attain them because sometimes our work ethnic does not live up to our aspirations. As a result, Rudy is an inspiration to anyone who thought they couldn't hang in there or don't think they have the potential to even try. You can do anything you but your heart and mind to, it is just a question of maintaining that integrity for the entire journey. Every single time I watch \"Rudy\", tears race down my face. This film makes me want to strive for all that I thought I can be and attain the most seemingly intangible achievements in life. It is important to have things in life which help you to realize your dreams and persuade you to act on them. \"Rudy\" is mine."
