      "overview": "Two men answer the call of the ocean in this romantic fantasy-adventure.  Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo (Jean Reno) are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men (he even considers a school of dolphins as his extended family).  As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.",

         "This is the movie of my life ! I never before saw a film that i could identify myself so much with. I¬¥m lucky enough to live in a place near the sea very similar and as beautiful as those in the movie and the opening scenes always remind me of my teenage years and the waters i explored like young Jaqques Mayol does in the beginning of the movie. Things that i still do. So i immediatley related to the character and its love for the ocean. I guess that¬¥s the beauty of this movie. It makes us feel that we could be any of its characters, because they¬¥re so real. We almost can¬¥t believe that they don¬¥t exist outside of the movie. This is an amazing ,beautifuly well written ,acted, photographed and directed movie ! It carries us into an extraordinary world, and it¬¥s our world !! (mine at least to some point) Not some hollywood depiction of reality ! But what it¬¥s about it ? This is the worst thing anyone can ask about this movie. I would hate to be the guy who had to publicize this in USA. And i can see why it failed there. But what can i say about it?... That it¬¥s the story of two friends who compete to find out who¬¥s best ?...It¬¥s more than that ! That it¬¥s a love story ? It goes beyond every love story ! That it¬¥s an adventure ? You bet it is ! But it has no action, no chases,no dangerous cliffangers, no guns and no explosions. It doesn¬¥t even has bad guys ! Or good guys in fact. That it¬¥s a travel or a road movie ? Probably. This movie has better locations than any James Bond movie will ever get and they¬¥re all real ! But they don¬¥t matter much compared to the characters in the film. The characters then... There¬¥s a hero right ?... Well there¬¥s two of them. Two men. But they¬¥re not heroes. Probably the hero is a woman who sacrifices her happiness for love. So, there¬¥s a woman and two men. There¬¥s got to be a love triangle there to cause all those love story rivalary subplots, right ? Well, there¬¥s a love triangle, but there aren¬¥t subplots attached to it. In fact the love triangle has more than three people. All characters are a part of it realy. Including dolphins ! Even the ocean. Aha ! So this is some sort of a kinky erotic and exotic movie thing ? Wrong ! There¬¥s sex in it, but not in that way at all. It¬¥s a comedy then... You¬¥ll laugh, but you¬¥ll cry too. It¬¥s a drama ... Not in the conventional clich√© way. Not at all. A dramatic comedy... Nope ! It¬¥s a sci-fi film !... Well there¬¥s scientists in it, and deep underwater, and even under ice diving scenes, but it¬¥s not a scifi film, although the American \"version\" Movie Trailler presented it like if it were some new esotheric adventure underwater sci-fi horror movie, when in fact it is not. So what is this movie about ?!! It¬¥s about what you want it to be. About what you¬¥re feeling. It¬¥s that open. You just have to feel it. As Luc Besson said in an interview, at some point in the movie he was stuck, because he didn¬¥t know how to carry the audience inside. Then the real Jaqques Mayol, who worked in the film as a diving and story consultant took Besson diving with him one day and made him experience the sea in his way. Then Besson understood that he didn¬¥t had to explain anything to the audience. He just had to make people feel what it was like ! And boy, did he make it ! The atmosphere in this movie goes beyond words. It has to be felt ! Also the soundtrack is out of this world and trully magical. To me this film is about love, but in a much deeper meaning than the usual. Beyond race, beyond gender, beyond sex, beyond nationality. Love as an emotion. And about freedom ! So get a wide screen TV and a full blast surround. This movie is the reason to buy one if you don¬¥t have it! Believe me ! And watch it in the dark. Try to get the european full version of the movie. The american is not that terrible, the feeling is there, but it¬¥s diferent from the original. This movie is a masterpiece ! ( in any version )",
         "This movie is the most fantastic contemplation of earth paradise in existence. First it's imperative that we notice one major difference: the short version and the \"version longue\" are two completely different films. From tip to toe. I only knew this film previously in its short version. Yesterday I bought the \"version longue\" in my local FNAC store without subtitles (it's rare these days). And.................... I fell in love with everything about it, stunned and mesmerized, being at the same time riddled by the way that the short version lost all sense, in comparison with the \"longue\" version. You can think of an integral version like a way to stuff a film with pictures, but in this movie we have the feeling that the movie was intended to have 164 minutes, and not nearly two. And you can picture the transformation that occurred in my perception of this film, as I passed from that mutilated, full-screen, mono-sound version to a full, widescreen and hi-fi version. This is why \"Le Grand Bleu\" passed from just a movie by Luc Besson to the greatest movie of my greatest director. My perception is that this is the great underwater epic he always wanted to make. And he achieves it in every way, specially letting the audience identify themselves with it. Perhaps my favorite Besson movie was \"The Fifth Element\" (I like them all), but after having the privilege of experiencing this fantastic, beautiful, stunning, vivid and moving film, \"The Big Blue\" passed from one of the medium levels to definitely the top one. The characters all gained strength, the underwater scenes all made sense, the previous movie was completely backed up, and the feeling that this movie was a contemplative journey gained finally its place. I gave it a 10 out of 10, not for the US version (how can they even think of erasing Eric Serra's score?!?!?) which, for its mutilations, deserved a 1, but for the version longue, which is the only way the movie shall be seen. What a masterpiece! After I saw this movie, I rewinded it thinking that my only wish is that one day I get to take part on such an experience, being there, dreaming and sharing my dream with everyone who would like to share it with me. Perhaps one day, a beautiful blue day...",
         "I have to watch this movie once a year just to calm my nerves. One of the few films to which I have also purchased the soundtrack. This film, like the sea which is its subject, hypnotizes you, seduces you, rocks you into a state of oneness with the lush scenery. Rosanna Arquette is beautiful and sexy in an uncharacteristically understated way. Barr makes the perfect beau and embodies the spirit of the film and the ocean. I fell in love with Jean Reno in this film. Unforgettable imagery, interesting premise, good chemistry between Arquette and Barr, and Reno is a joy to watch. Masterfully directed by Luc Besson and a film to treasure.",
         "THE movie that made Besson go down in history. A key-movie that divided the French public between the ones who saw on it, only a tedious documentary about the ocean and the others who acclaimed this passionating movie. As far as I'm concerned, I rank in the second category. \"Le grand bleu\", it's simply a periphrase with a tinge of euphemism to design the ocean, a universe that always inspired to men fear but also fascination. The two main characters, Jacques Maillol and Enzo Molinari are fascinated by the sea but for different reasons. If Reno devotes all his energies to diving so as to access to success and glory, the sea is more than this for Jacques. He was born with it, he swears by it (so much that he neglects Johanna's love) and the sea will lead him to death. A place of athletic competition, an ideal place for rest and entertaining where dolphins are his real and sole friends, finally the eternal heaven, the ocean epitomizes all this to Jacques. \"le grand bleu\" also ranks among the movies that you must watch rather than telling it. Of course, there isn't almost any plot, dialogs are short and rare but pictures are gorgeous enough to create an entrancing climate supported by Eric Serra's mesmerizing music. The movie's technical qualities can only arouse admiration: a shiny photography that perfectly reflects the color of the sea, the blue and a fluid making sometimes clever: Jacques' childhood is made in black and white. Besides, the movie enabled to discover two outstanding actors: Jean-Marc Barr and Jean Reno but oddly if Reno became one of the most popular French actors, it wasn't the case with Barr. In spite of a promising debut, he has never be able to make a movie that could have got back him in the saddle. Maybe was he so elated at the bottom of the sea, in heaven where everything is fine...",
         "For me the grand bleu is something unique...i have never seen a movie were everybody has the same love for the sea,and for their sport... Even if the movie is from 1988...it is still one of a kind!!! Go and see it yourself!! When i lived in France in 1989..everybody was talking about Le Grand Bleu...I still have the music.. And a poster on the toilet.. It remindes me of the good old time.. I have also the movie version long on DVD...it is so beautiful!! You will laugh and cry during Le Grand Bleu. Find out for yourself what your impression is, and you wont be disappointed!",
         "The Big Blue is a story mainly centred around Jacques Mayol (Jean-Marc Barr), a free diver. Free diving is a sport where people dive as deep as they can with a single breath, and no equipment other than a rope and a weighted mechanism to take them to the required depth. Although to say the story of Big Blue is just about free diving does not do it any justice. The story starts in Greece with Jacques as a child, then moves forward to \"present day\". In the story we also have Enzo (Jean Reno), Jacque's lifelong friend and nemesis who motivates him to free dive in competition (so he has some competition) and also gets him work in other areas of diving. During this work Jacques meets an insurance investigator Johana (Rosanna Arquette), and a romance starts (albeit mostly from her). The story continues as Jacques struggles with problems in his past, present and future. The Big Blue is an unusual movie. There is some silly (but arguably funny) humour. Also there are some serious levels including romance, and how we deal with problems from our past, our existence, and our future. The film is also quite long (in the aptly named \"version longue\") at about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Fans of Jean Reno would certainly love this movie. I really enjoyed this film. The main story is very light and thinly stretched, so to really enjoy it I feel you have to look deeper at the characters and read between the lines. I also really enjoyed the humour, which was silly but fun and was a good counterpoint to the serious scenes. Jean-Marc Barr was absolutely stunning as Jacques, bearing in mind the number of underwater sequences that were required as well. It's a real shame that we don't see Jean-Marc in more leading roles. Jean Reno was also extremely good, and although for me an irritating character Rosanna Arquette put in a reasonable performance. The cinematography is another lush element of the film, with the beautiful locations and underwater sequences (especially those with the dolphins). Eric Serra's soundtrack is pretty good also, although sounds a little dated. As mentioned, this review is based on the \"version longue\". 5/5",
         "This was my 3rd stop (2nd real stop, I have decided not to count Fifth Element)into the world of Luc Besson, and i have to say I was mightily impressed, Leon is still topping my list, I was absolutely blown away by that, but it is almost impossible to compare the two as they are completely different in mood and genre. For anyone wanting to watch a fantastic dream of a film, with absorbing characters, true love in all its forms and some awesome underwater photography then this is for you! The characters are all formed perfectly, almost exaggerated but not, Jean Reno is his usual astounding self, and Jean-Marc Barr really out does himself, with Rosanna Arquette in a superb supporting roll. the story ambles along at its own pace but never stops or gets dull keeping you interested along the way, I don't want to go too much into it as it was kind of spoiled for my by reading too much of these boards, needless to say I was crying at one point, and that doesn't happen often. The score compliments the film perfectly, Eric Serra has done a wonderfully emotive score that almost interacts with the scenes along the way. Overall I'd give this film a 9/10, yet again awesome direction, acting and soundtrack, and definitely in my top films! just a shame i've borrowed it off a mate and have to give it back tomorrow, it's definitely something i could watch again and again!",
         "A captivating film that appears almost magical. Fine performance by Jean-Marc Barr that is too easily overlooked. His sensitive portrayal captures one's heart and mind and locks you in for the duration. Well backed up by Arquette and Reno with perhaps too much taken out for the US release. Watch and enjoy and allow yourself to be taken on a magical journey into and through a mans heart and soul. Congratulations to all involved. This one is a modern day classic.",
         "47. THE BIG BLUE (adv.-romance, 1988) Mayol (Jean-Marc Barr) is determined to dethrone current world-free diving champion Enzo (Jean Reno). Childhood friends, they share a fierce rivalry that, nonetheless, has kept their friendship alive. Both of them share an almost spiritual affinity with the sea, especially Mayol who lost his father. His love for his sport, however, is put on hold when he meets Joanna (Rosanna Arquette). But as Mayol and Enzo's competition become more fierce, Joanna slowly feels herself drifting away from Mayol, as his fascination with the sea takes on an obsessive turn. Critique: Marvelouslly filmed underwater adventure from master-Frenchman Luc Besson, who has specialized on action films. This is his most personal work to date, thus taking on a uniquely surreal quality. The exquisite camera-work is very special, at times almost documentary in quality. This mix of 'art' cinematography and romance made it a big money earner all over Europe but, not surprisingly, only gained critical acclaim elsewhere. Adding to its failure is a somewhat downbeat ending that, I think, complements the film's mythic storyline. Besson's 'epic masterpiece' has yet to reach many viewers who would embrace his visionary talents.",
         "This movie has been a favorite of mine since it was first released. I enjoy the romance of the films locations. I enjoy the small bits of humor within the twisting plot. Unlike any movie anyone has ever seen before. just beautiful."

They were not real friends in these days, but there was something they both loved and used to do the whole day long: diving. One day Jacques' father, who was a diver too, died in the Mediterranean sea. After that incident Enzo and Jacques lost contact. After several years, Enzo and Jacques had grown up, Johanna, a young clerk in a security office, has to go to Peru. There she meets Jacques who works for a group of scientists. He dives for some minutes into ice-cold water and the scientists monitor his physical state that is more like a dolphin's than a human's. Johanna can not believe what she sees and gets very interested in Jacques but she's unable to get acquainted with him. Some weeks later, back in her office, she notices a championship for divers that is supposed to take place in Taormina, Italy. In order to see Jacques again she makes up a story so the firm sends her to Italy for business purposes. In Taormina there is also Enzo, the reigning diving world champion. He knows that only Jacques can challenge and probably beat him. This time Johanna and Jacques get closer, but Jacques, being more a dolphin than a man, can not really commit and his rivalry with Enzo pushes both men into dangerous territory..."],

      "plotSummary": "Two men answer the call of the ocean in this romantic fantasy-adventure.  Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo (Jean Reno) are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men (he even considers a school of dolphins as his extended family).  As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.",
