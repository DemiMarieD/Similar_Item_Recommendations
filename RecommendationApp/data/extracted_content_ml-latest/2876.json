      "synopsis": "Thumbelina is worried that there is no one her size so her mother tells her a story of fairies. That night the fairy prince comes to her window and hears her singing. They instantly fall in love and go flying and singing together where toads and bugs see them. Prince Cornelius promises to come back the next day after telling his parents about her. That night a toad comes and steals Thumbelina away because she heard her singing and wants her to join the family band \"Singers de Espagna.\" Her toad son loves Thumbelina and wants to marry her. After convincing Thumbelina that she will be a star in show biz the toads leave her on a lily pad to get things ready for a wedding. Thumbelina is angry and calls for help, she doesn't want to marry the toad, she loves Cornelius. Meanwhile, Prince Cornelius goes to her house and finds her gone. The dog tells him that she was stolen by a toad and he leaves vowing to find her. He rushes home and asks his parents to stall the frost, which they can't really do. Thumbelina meets a bird who helps her off the lily pad and promises to find the Prince for her. A beetle hears Thumbelina and gets her to sing at a Beetle Ball where the beetles tell her she is ugly. The bird finds her (without news of the Prince) and reminds her that Prince Cornelius thinks she is beautiful and that she shouldn't give up. The Toad searches for Thumbelina and finds the beetle and steals his wings so the beetle will find the Prince for him so he can set a trap to get Thumbelina, since she will come for the Prince. Cornelius falls into water and gets frozen. The beetle finds him, pulls the block of ice out and brings him to the Toad and tells him where Thumbelina is. Thumbelina is taken in by Ms. Field Mouse who tells her that Prince Cornelius was found dead. Ms. Field Mouse introduces Thumbelina to Mr. Mole. Mr. Mole wants to marry Thumbelina and bribes Ms. Field Mouse to set them up. He also shows them a \"dead bird\" who happens to be Thumbelina's bird friend who got a thorn in his wing and passed out and fell into Mr. Mole's hole. Thumbelina comes and warms him that night and pulls the thorn out. The bird flies off to find the veil of the fairies before Thumbelina can tell him that Cornelius is dead. Thumbelina goes to marry the Mole. Some young jitterbugs thaw out the Prince. At the altar, amid visions of Prince Cornelius, Thumbelina refuses to marry the mole and runs. The toad arrives and tries to catch her, but she refuses him too. She runs out and heads towards the light outside of the hole. Prince Cornelius shows up after she runs out and duels with the Toad. Above ground the bird finds Thumbelina and flies her to the veil of the fairies. It is frozen and she doesn't believe it's the veil of the fairies. The bird tells her to sing. She sings a little and gives up, then Prince Cornelius starts to sing and then proposes, Thumbelina accepts and sprouts wings. They get married and \"live happily ever after.\"",

         "This is a triumph for Don Bluth! I really enjoyed it. The songs are sweet, & memorable. Jodie Benson (Ariel, The Little Mermaid) plays the title role, & she has such a great voice. I would recommend this movie to any family who is stuck in the Disney collection only rut. Give Thumbelina a chance!",
         "So help me, this is the cutest thing I've ever seen! I just love this film. First time I saw it, I went with my 7 year old brother, and was determined to hate it - but, well, I just couldn't. It's soooo cute, and the songs are so good, and the story is so well told - it's just impossible not to like it. The first thing that I really like about this film is that it (unlike, oh so many Disney films) is actually very loyal to the original fairy tale by H.C. Andersen. They've added a few things, and changed a few details, but all of the things they changed I had to agree with (hey, why not let Thumbelina and the Prince meet at the beginning? It makes more sense for them to already be in love. And what's wrong with making the Fieldmouse a girl? It's Carol Channing!) This is very true to the original story - so much more than Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID (which was supposedly based off another H.C. Andersen tale - but you'd never guess it). The animation is good, it's not the best, but it's fine. The real star of this film is the music. A beautiful score by Barry Manilow helped out by fabulous voice work. The wonderful Jodi Benson heads the cast (she was also the voice of Ariel in THE LITTLE MERMAID) and she is delightful as Thumbelina. I've been lucky enough to meet Ms. Benson and I have to say, she is just the sweetest person you could ever hope to know. She's got a wonderful, child-like speaking voice, and a glorious singing voice - just the perfect choice for the lead. She's joined in the cast by Gilbert Gottfried, Barbara Cook, Carol Channing, and (another voice talent from THE LITTLE MERMAID) Kenneth Mars. This film is just beautifully done. It's faithful to the original, it's lovely to see, and has a marvelous soundtrack. I don't care that I'm all grown up - this is a movie I can't help but love.",
         "I totally disagree which Pynchov. How dare he say the film was terrible. The way he describes it makes it sound like a horror movie. This film was absolutely brilliant. It was fun, enjoyable, enchanting and had some memorable characters. I have had the video for years and I would still watch it. The songs in the movie were inspiring and the scenes were picture-perfect. It was nothing like that totally rubbish 2003 Thumbelina and Tom Thumb film. People must see the 1994 version!!!!! I think the frog characters were excellent and some of the songs they came out with were really funny. The beetle ball was a great scene and looked really unusual. The scenes were beautiful. Full of luscious green fields and beautiful flowers, it was so inspiring! One of the best characters was Jacquimo! I loved his accent!! Thumbelina and Cornelius were the perfect fairy tale couple in a perfect fairy-tale film.",
         "This is a movie that grows on me. When first getting a copy, made little mark, but after my 3 yr old daughter started requested this repeatedly several times a day, I've found the songs and animation to have grown on me. It has much of the enchantment and dreamy themes that Disney studios seem only to accomplish during those revitalized golden years of early 90's at Disney. But I trust my daughter's taste, and I have a new found love now in this 10 year old hidden treasure myself. Jodi Benson has a beautiful voice and it may be this is on of the leading attributes that captures attention the same way her Mermaid performance as Ariel has done. I believe the test of a good film, is one that captures year heart and you can call you're own, and this one has found a way to do that.",
         "Good Grief- where to begin. Many of the critical reviews here have touched on most of what I disliked so immensely about the movie. Stupid dialogue, annoying characters (even Thumbelina herself), very odd pacing to the movie (holes), and Thumbelina couldn't keep her dress down. Weird scenes- she just meets the Prince Fairy and starts singing and they put their hands all over each other. She later is kidnapped but instead of being upset that she can't marry her prince she starts dancing and singing and thanking the mother toad- what??!!! Now, I love most of the princess movies and cartoons out there- but this one is very, very poorly made. It was torture to sit through it with my 6 year old daughter- it will be \"disappearing\" from our shelf this week.",
         "Ever since I first saw this movie I have loved it. It grabbed hold of my imagination. It also follows very close to the original story which is more than I can say for several other books made to movies. It has also captivated the imagination of my children. They will sit through this movie and then talk about it all day. They even pretend to be the characters. This movie is one of the greatest children's movies ever made. It has comedy, beautiful music,a love story and it also teaches a valuable lesson....To always follow your heart and you will have your dreams realized. I recommend this movie to anyone who is in the mood for a feel good movie that leaves you with the feeling that you can do anything if you want it strong enough. I love the songs, I love the story, I love it all.",
         "Charming rendition of the familiar tale... great songs, almost a show... and not too sticky.. the whole family loves it!",
         "I LOVE Thumbelina! My Mom taped it for me when I was little and I would watch it every day. Now my niece does the same thing. I guess it runs in the family! A great movie for the family to sit down and watch together or kids to watch on their own. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT! YOU'LL LOVE IT!",
         "Keep in mind the comments you read about this movie ARE opinions. Don't base the movie solely off of those opinions. Rent it, and watch it YOURSELF instead of listening to any crock or praise that may be posted about it here. PERSONALLY.... I enjoy the movie very much. I watched it when I was a tiny little gremlin, and I still watch it now on occasion. I'm 15 and one of my silly little fetishes are Disney movies. They're WAY better than the new ones at any rate. (...and cleaner too, heh.) Thumbelina is a wonderful Fairytale with pretty songs and the beautiful voice of Jodi Benson. Fairies, jitterbugs, mice, beetles, fish, frogs, a mole, and a swallow... all the tiny things. (With some big animals at the beginning.) I think the main reason why i like the movie is the images, the color (especially at the end) is beautiful. The story is a wonderful children's fairytale. I don't know if kid's nowadays would enjoy it or not, because they have all the Pixar stuff, but my five year old sister does enjoy seeing it once in a while. I loved it when I was little (and still do).",
         "If there was ever proof that the \"it doesn't matter cause the kid's won't notice\" philosophy has any reason to exist, Thumbelina just might be it. I distinctly remember liking this movie, if not exactly loving it, when it was first released. But oh, how time changes things. Not everything about Thumbelina is entirely terrible. Jodi Benson still has a lovely voice and the \"I want\" song and love ballad, though moderately bland, remain largely unoffensive to the ear. Even Charo's performance had me cracking a smile. But beyond that... Characterwise, everyone is a nutcase, with the exception of the Mother, who gets the least screen time of anyone. Thumbelina is frankly dumb as a post, lacking anything that resembles a mind of her own. The other villains and protagonists alike garner no prizes in the brain category, but they make up for it with either general maliciousness or extra-large doe eyes. Jacquiamo does have the distinction of being the animated world's Jar-Jar Binks with his overblown french faerieness. Visually, the film isn't much of a stunner either. The leads, while not precisely ugly, have the absolute most ridiculous hairstyles I have seen outside of an indie space flick. The computer scenes, like the opening sequence and the frog boat are so jarringly CGI that the simply jerk you out of the experience of the movie to goggle at the disjunct. Don Bluth is well loved for his distinct visual style that at one point appeared to rival the Disney Empire. Part of what I love about films like All Dogs Go To Heaven is that they are so entirely unlike Disney fare, unlike most anything else out there at all. Thumbelina represents a different Bluth, one who began to doubt that he could overtake the big bad corporation, and scrambled together a bad imitation. It just doesn't take to his style, plus no one can ever out-Disney Disney."
