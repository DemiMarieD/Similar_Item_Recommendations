Everything changes forever after a ship arrives from England, prospecting the region's commercial potential for the rich Sir George, who uses all his wealth and influence only for ever greater profit. When it returns, several Indians find themselves captives on board, including Squanto. The arrogant Christians consider themselves utterly superior to the 'heathen savages' and treat them as brutally as they do beasts. Squanto fights a bear in a circus, not understanding how men can be so cruel to that creature either, and manages a spectacular escape, but where must he go? He finds shelter and help in a rural monastery, where it takes his protector some effort to prevent the others considering the unknown as diabolical. In time sir George's men come looking for him most brutally...",

         "This is not a documentary so I can forgive the time-line inaccuracies. But it does tell a story that is based, at least in part, on a real human being, brave, intelligent, life-loving. To have suffered the loss of dignity through kidnap and slavery and then, when finally returned home, the additional heartache of the fate of not only his family but of his entire tribe, he continued to give of himself, no matter the purpose of his generosity. This movie may not teach history correctly (although it at least tries to include the people who most influenced Squanto), but it DOES teach children values... the value of treating people with dignity; the value of freedom; the value of humanity; that slavery is wrong; that war, even if necessary, is a \"last resort.\" For teaching these things alone I recommend this movie.",
         "While it is true that this story is not historically accurate, I have to say, in this case, part of the story is better than no story. It is refreshing, even for a Disney film, to see such stories brought to film for anyone to watch. It is worth the effort of watching. For myself, the story provided an introduction to the life story of Squanto. This, in turn, raised my curiosity. This led me to look him up and learn more of his life. Again, this is a good place to begin to learn of the life of Squanto--a real person and an important person--in the course of the American Experience. What you learn following viewing this film is up to you. Disney, however, provides a good introduction to Squanto.",
         "I knew that the Pilgrims were met by Squanto in the spring of 1621 and he greeted them in English. One headline said that the story was historically inaccurate. I saw this as a substitute teacher for fifth graders. To them it was history. To me it was history. Hiding out with English Franciscan brothers in the early years of King James the First, Squanto is pursued by his owner (Michael Gambon). The owner says, \"You Franciscans shouldn't even exist legally!\" That's about right. Catholics were outlawed, but were often protected or ignored by the sympathetic royalty who were more \"Catholic\" than low-Church Puritan or dissenter Protestant. The way Squanto gets the friars to act more \"natural\" like him is hilarious. And correct. Franciscan brothers were of the people and like their founder were open to and appreciative of differences in God's creatures. Saying grace by pounding the table and chanting a native song has to be seen. Naturally, Squanto's idea of the English came from these men and worked for the good of the Pilgrims, themselves simple people.",
         "As a history buff and a published writer in that subject, I was distressed to see how the film's storyline warped the real history of Squanto, especially in how he was treated by his English hosts, which was mostly cordial by all accounts, during the many years he actually lived on the other side of the Pond (and should have gotten Frequent Sailor Miles for all those trips he made back and forth over the Atlantic.) But it does show he learned the lessons of the Christian virtues taught him by the Franciscan monks and others who befriended him during that time, and more important, he passed them on to his Indian brethren so that they might live in harmony with their new neighbors. Like two other films that were released about this same time, DANCES WITH WOLVES and LAST OF THE MOHICANS, it shows that people of differing cultures can work together to accomplish great things, even in the face of great hostility between the two sides by those not so enlightened. At the screening of this film last night at the Lidgerwood Presbyterian Church, we watched this tale unfold and found it to be a great way of remembering why we celebrate Thanksgiving in the U.S.A. History teaches us (or it did when most of us in the church's audience went to school)that Squanto played a huge part in ensuring the Pilgrims could grow enough food and hunt and fish well enough to survive the coming winter, a task he did so well that it enabled the Pilgrims and their Indian neighbors to partake in a feast that continues as a tradition in America almost four centuries later. But this film carries a message beyond our traditional rationale for having a uniquely American holiday set apart to give thanks to God for providing bounty and blessings to all Americans in this land.That mostly overlooked message that many of us don't see today but that Squanto recognized is that peace and brotherhood and charity must be practiced if we are to survive and prosper in this world. In a year (1994) when the Disney Studios released so many entertaining films (IRON WILL, THE LION KING, THE JUNGLE BOOK, THE SANTA CLAUSE, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD, D2-MIGHTY DUCKS,) this stood out as a real gem of a movie that still entertains and inspires us today. I think Walt Disney would have been proud to have put his name on such a fine production by the motion picture company bearing his name. Thanks be to Walt, thanks be to Squanto and thanks, most of all, to God. Happy Thanksgiving. Dale Roloff",
         "personally, i think this was a great movie. i just finished watching it and loved it. some say that it was inaccurate, but give me one example how it was. Squanto's tribe was killed by disease, he was kidnapped by the English, and he showed the Pilgrims how to plant and farm. sure, he may not have stopped a \"war\" between the Pilgrims and his friend's tribe (who is played by a favorite actor of mine and a very hot guy) but otherwise the rest of the movie is fairly accurate. sure, i was sad when Squanto had been so hopeful to come back to his bride and when he gets back he finds out she's gone, but sometimes you gotta survive. i'm part Indian and i know all about surviving and just barely getting thru life. death and loss is a fact of life.",
         "I believe this is one of the best movies for this time in our country . It is so refreshing to see and hear such clear meaning of life as it is depicted in this movie . We need more of this today . It is so nice not to hear profanity and not have to see explicit displays of obscene and lewd sexual behavior in this fine movie . Hollywood is not doing it's part for America today as all they are interested is money and ratings . The public sends them a message and they give us the finger . I hope I can live long enough to see the return of desency to all forms of broadcasting . I suppose we will always have smut but it does not have to be the norm ..!! I thank you for opportunity to comment and I hope this is a positive contribution.",
         "It's a Disney movie, so adults beware. Kids need to beware only in the sense of historical inaccuracies. But if truth be told, it's not the worst live action film Disney ever spit out. It may remind some of Disney's live-action take on THE JUNGLE BOOK of a few years back. And you get to see Adam Beach before he hit it big.",
         "I saw this one day under the Free Movies given to me by my cable provider. It so happened to be on the list of movies to watch for a AP summer work packet, and so I decided to watch it so I could get the blasted assignment over with. I did not know it was a Disney movie until I saw those words on the screen. It was historically inaccurate, which was no surprise considering Disney's other works. Nevertheless, it was still enjoyable, more so if history-related movies are your thing. Watch it. Even if history-related movies aren't your thing, chances are you'll get a kick out of one of the characters, Sir George. His stick-on mole changed locations for practically every scene.",
         "This movie opens by introducing us to Squanto and his fellow tribe members . We`re shown that despite being unsophisticated and non white European they are still capable of being noble , loving and caring members of the human race . I don`t dispute that white European doesn`t always = good anymore than non white European = bad but you do get the impression that if any white Europeans turned up they`d instantly be the bad guys . True to form a ship comes sailing into the horizon Right away the movie becomes totally anachronistic as the ship hoists the British union flag . The act of union between England and Scotland didn`t happen until 1707 while the St Patrick cross of Ireland wasn`t added to the flag until later still so considering this movie is set in 1620 it`s totally wrong . There`s other anachronistic details when the action ( Inaction more like - This is a boring movie ) tranfers to England which I won`t bore you with since you`ll be bored enough without my help . Oh and Britain was the first country to abolish slavery in the early 19th century , just thought I`d point this out since A WARRIOR`S TALE really does seem to think all the evil in the world began and ended with The British empire even if in 1620 Britain as a country didn`t exist as such A word about the acting - It`s totally variable . Alex Norton gives a good performance as a one dimensional bad guy and OZ fans will notice Mark Margolis do a very convincing English accent . However nearly everyone else is totally wooden while Michael Gambon gives a truly ridiculous performance Perhaps the best way to evaluate this movie`s true worth is for me to point out my local ITV network broadcast it at 1.40 am",
         "What a boat load of bunk. If you're looking for a slice of history at Thanksgiving, look elsewhere because Squanto's Warrior Tale is so far off the mark, it's laughable. For those of us who have done much reading on the subject, it becomes obvious early on that this movie is about as credible and accurate as something from Oliver Stone. This movie is so far beyond artistic license, it's ridiculous. Save your time and don't confuse your kid with this tripe. The Peanuts version of the Mayflower crossing and First Thanksgiving is far more accurate."

Everything changes forever after a ship arrives from England, prospecting the region's commercial potential for the rich Sir George, who uses all his wealth and influence only for ever greater profit.

         "This film tells the story of Squanto, who has been taken to England against his will from his New England homeland. He escapes his captors, stealing a boat and heading to sea. After his boat wrecks in a storm, he's found by some friars and stays in their monastery until he gets a chance to return home. He finally gets back, only to find his people decimated by a plague and English people living in what was once his home. He's faced with the choice of joining another tribe in their attack on the Pilgrims or trying to make peace between the two sides.",
         "Set in the early 1600's, a New England Indian brave warrior named Squanto is captured and subsequently enslaved by English settlers, but survives a shipwreck and returns to America to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in their strange new land.
