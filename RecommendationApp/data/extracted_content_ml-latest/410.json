      "synopsis": "Gomez (Raul Julia) and Morticia Addams (Anjelica Huston) welcome their third child: a mustachioed baby boy named Pubert. Older siblings Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) openly loathe their new brother, and repeatedly attempt to eliminate him by tossing him from the roof of the house, dropping an anvil on him, and decapitating him with a guillotine. Alas, in true Addams style, little Pubert cheats death and mutilation time and time again. He also amuses himself by shooting flaming arrows from his cradle. With the house a shambles, Morticia and Gomez opt to hire a nanny to keep the children in check. Wednesday and Pusgly make short work of every new applicant until the arrival of Debbie Jelinsky (Joan Cusack), a seemingly sweet, chipper, and innocent woman who is hired on the spot. Hapless Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd), who had been pining for a romantic relationship, immediately becomes infatuated with the beautiful newcomer. It is revealed that Debbie, unbeknownst to her new employers, is a serial killer who preys on wealthy and lonely men. Knowing of the vast Addams fortune, she had selected Fester as her next victim. She coyly flirts with him, toying with his naive emotions, hoping to marry him and then murder him for his wealth. Debbie's ruse does not fool Wednesday and Pugsly, who make no secret of their suspicions. To remove them from the picture, Debbie persuades Gomez and Morticia to send them to summer camp. To their confusion and horror, Pugsley and Wednesday are sent to the bland and WASP-y Camp Chippewa. Lost in a sea of blond, preppy children, they quickly make enemies with the snobby Amanda Buckman (Mercedes McNab), and the disturbingly cheerful camp owners, Gary and Becky Granger (Peter MacNicol and Christine Baranski). They befriend another misfit, the nerdy Joel Glicker (David Krumholtz), who develops a crush on Wednesday. The three are often sent to the Harmony Hut, a tiny cottage decorated with flowers and inspirational posters, and forced to watch sappy musicals and Disney films as a twisted form of punishment. Though overwhelmed with desire for Debbie, Fester is too shy to speak to her. He recruits Gomez and Morticia to accompany them on a double date for moral support. Fester makes a typical slob of himself on the dinner outing, but Debbie, with the fortune in mind, pretends to return his affections and the two are engaged by the end of the night. Wednesday and Pugsley receive the news of Fester's impending wedding, and resolve to stop him from marrying the two-faced Debbie. Along with Joel, they attempt to sneak out of the camp at night but are caught. They later confirm Debbie's sinister true identity from a pack of Joel's, \"Schitzos and Serial Killers\" trading cards. The children briefly visit home to attend Fester and Debbie's wedding, which takes place in a graveyard. The newlyweds leave for their Hawaiian honeymoon. While Fester bathes in their hotel room, Debbie attempts to kill him by dropping a radio into the bathtub. She is shocked to find, of course, that Fester is impervious to death and actually seems to enjoy the experience. A frustrated Debbie bribes the (virgin) Fester with sex, telling him that if they make love he can never see his family again. Fester is reluctant to agree, but is soon seduced. He informs Gomez that they can never meet again, and Gomez spirals into depression. Debbie and Fester move into a lavish mansion, where Gomez and Morticia attempt to visit. Fester is still enslaved by Debbie, who banishes her in-laws from the house. Soon after, baby Pubert goes through dramatic emotional and physical changes: he becomes a blond-haired, rosy-cheeked giggling cherub. Morticia and Gomez are horrified. Grandmama (Carol Kane), Morticia's witch mother, determined that the changes were brought on by anxiety due to Fester's departure, and may become permanent if not addressed quickly. The family resolves to win Fester back. Meanwhile, Gary and Becky have arranged the end-of-camp play, an incredibly inaccurate and prejudiced musical about the first Thanksgiving. Amanda Buckman is given the lead role of the Pilgrim heroine Sarah Miller, while Wednesday is cast in the \"secondary, but still compellingly written\" role of Pocahontas. Pugsley, Joel, and the other misfit campers become even more at odds with the rest of the camp, but Wednesday becomes inexplicably cooperative (and even cracks a smile). At the performance, however, the kids get their revenge. Wednesday, who had been faking her sweet behavior, leads the misfits (dressed as Indians) on a rebellion, burning the stage and tying up other campers. She, Joel, and Pugsley escape by canoe as Gary and Becky are tied to a spit over an open fire. Joel and Wednesday have their first kiss, while Pugsley hijacks a camp van to take them home. For their three-week anniversary, Fester is preparing a fancy dinner for himself and Debbie. Debbie hides a massive bomb in a gift box, leaving it with Fester while she goes out to get champagne. She returns home later to watch the explosion, but is foiled again when an intact Fester emerges intact from the rubble. Debbie then pulls a gun on Fester and prepares to shoot him, but Fester is saved by Thing, the family's loyal disembodied hand, who is driving Debbie's car.They speed off towards the Addams' mansion, with Debbie in hot pursuit. The Addams family has a brief, happy reunion before they are interrupted and captured by a vengeful Debbie who is wielding a shotgun. Debbie straps the family into electric chairs, then explains her life via a slide show, citing an incident on her tenth birthday as the catalyst for her life of crime (her parents bought her Malibu Barbie instead of Ballerina Barbie). Mercifully, baby Pubert manages to get to the attic and splice two loose wires together, reversing the current so that when Debbie throws the switch, she is reduced to a pile of dust and credit cards. Her tombstone is shown to be inscribed: \"Debbie Addams, Wife and Psycho\". Months later, the family celebrates Pubert's first birthday. After the party, Wednesday and Joel (whom she had invited) visit Debbie's grave. Wednesday claims that Debbie was sloppy for allowing herself to be caught, and that if she herself were to ever marry she would scare her husband to death. Joel scoffs it off, but is suddenly grabbed by a bloody hand that shoots from the ground, as Wednesday gives a knowing smirk.",

         "One of my favorite films. Paul Rudnick clearly had a field day writing this screenplay. As odd as it may seem, this sequel is in many ways superior to its predecessor. The first had to spend much of its time introducing the Family--and, just as importantly, paying (totally justified) homage to Charles Addams' brilliant cartoons and to the old television series. As a result, the plot felt forced, as if it had been the best way the writers could think of to showcase all the source material. In the end, one left the theater feeling that the movie had been 'about' the old sight gags. And then there was the totally shameless product placement...but I digress. Addams Family Values, on the other hand, gets to be more playful. Because we all know who we're dealing with by now, we don't have to spend nearly so much time introducing the family and their skewed universe. Instead, the characters get more of a chance to develop as they glide blithely through a fuller, more cohesive story. Paul Rudnick's screenplay is masterful--you'll be quoting from it for weeks. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston are particularly marvelous as one of the most genuinely loving, passionate couples you've seen in ages. In a weird sort of way. That dance number! Morticia's ever-present shaft of light! Christina Ricci as the sublime Wednesday! Joan Cusack, unhinged! A split-second cameo by Charles Busch! Oh, rapture. I could go on and on, but I'm running out of superlatives. Suffice it to say that this movie is well worth your time.",
         "This is a film with several excellent performances, but that of Christina \"Wednesday\" Ricci is near perfect. The reluctant smile outside the \"harmony hut\" is Oscar material. And Christina as Pocahantas is the very definition of \"cute\". Of the others, Joan Cusack also stands out. I doubt anyone else could play the part of \"the black widow\" quite as well, with just the right mix of sleaze and slapstick. Her deranged laughter alone is worth half the rental fee. It may not be a classic but it is solid entertainment, with few if any weak passages. Go and see it!",
         "Usually I don't like horror comedies and I hate mainstream movies,but \"Addams Family Values\" completely cracked me up.It was so immensely enjoyable and funny as hell!Especially the first Thanksgiving Day performance,where Wednesday Addams(Christina Ricci)as a Pocahontas,and other Indians took a revenge on American colonists-I almost cried with laughter during that scene!I wonder what Americans think about it?As for Christina Ricci,she simply steals the show in this one!I'm looking forward to see this talented,young actress in more movies.The other actors are also excellent,and the film is filled with wonderful touches of black humour.Highly recommended.",
         "Barry Sonnenfeld (Get Shorty) takes a zany script written by Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, In and Out) and directs with an exhilarating rhythm to tell the tale of Uncle Fester's marriage to a suspicious young nanny (Joan Cusack) and its effect on the Addams family. All the actors are absolutely wonderful but Cusack steals the movie with a gleefully nasty turn as the murderous Debbie. Her without-peer comedic talent is more strongly showcased here -watch the scene when Debbie sits in a car waiting for a house to explode- than in her award winning role as Kevin Kline's jilted bride in In and Out. Angelica Huston and Raoul Julia are magnetic in dramatic roles but they also have sensational comic timing and their Morticia and Gomez make a memorable dark-humored pair, most notably in the scenes where the sexual innuendo takes a front-row seat. Peter MacNichol (Ally McBeal) and Christine Baranski (The Ref) have a ball as the irritating summer camp counslers and Christina Ricci will probably never top her performance as Wednesday. It's a guilty pleasure and a fun ride, zipping by in an hour and a half and also features a hilarious cameo by Peter Graves (Airplane). Check it out!",
         "Considering what could have gone wrong with this movie, it's actually surprisingly good. When you think about sequels running in this vein, they often have problems. Addams Family Values does not. The Addams Family was a funny, if not just plain strange, movie, and good for its genre. Addams Family Values does the original just as good and perhaps even one better. One very unconventional thing about Addams Family Values was that it had a higher rating (PG-13) than the Addams Family (PG), something rarely seen with a sequel. This rating was mostly due to the increased amount of violence in the movie, including the scene where the campers roast the annoying counselors over a fire and, of course, Debbie (Joan Cusack) and her homicidal ways. A black comedy like its predecessor, Addams Family Values is an interesting movie and very funny. Look for smaller roles by perhaps bigger names than most of the regular cast: Nathan Lane as a police officer, David Hyde Pierce as a doctor, Tony Shalhoub as a drunken sailor, and Peter MacNicol and Christine Baranski as the Grangers.",
         "This film is one of those rare gems, a sequel that is as good as, or even better than the original. Christina Ricci fulfills all the promise that she showed in the first film, as she really steals the film from her more established co-stars. The scenes at camp produce some of the best one-liners, and it is great to see an American film that is self-mocking about its image concious rich societies. Lines from Ricci like \" Is that your overbite?\" and \"When they woke up all their old noses had grown back!\" are superb and will be much loved in the UK, as it is how much of the States is perceived over here. Also, Amanda in this movie, is also played by the same girl who played the Girl Scout in the first movie. Add a little bit of romance between Wednesday and another kid at the camp and you have something for everyone in this wonderfully funny and worryingly endearing movie.",
         "It's a pleasant surprise to see sequel live up to the original. All the actors are great, particularly Raul Julia and Christopher Lloyd. Oh, can not forget Anjelica Huston. Sequels rarely live up to their predecessor and that's what makes this movie so special. Filled with humor, Values is highly recommended for all.",
         "\"Addams Family Values\" is *finally* a sequel that lives up to the original. I thought this film was just as good as the first film if not better. I am so glad that the original cast decided to come back for the sequel (the only original cast member that didn't was \"Grandmama,\" but she had the smallest role out of the whole family so it didn't matter too much). Yet again Raul Julia and Christina Ricci turn in great performances as Gomez and Wednesday Addams, respectively, and Joan Cusack gives a great performance also as the homicidal Debbie Jillinsky who marries men for their money and then kills them on their wedding night, but after marrying Fester she just can't seem to get rid of him. The whole part of the script that dealt with Wednesday and Pugsley at summer camp was hilarious. And I thought Mercedes McNab as Amanda, who had a cameo as the girl scout in the first film, was hilarious and good in her role. The only thing I found sort of annoying about this movie was that it centered on Uncle Fester again. But, overall this is a great sarcastic comedy that lives up to it's predecessor. My Verdict: 7/10",
         "Almost everybody who was in the original \"The Addams Family\" returns to reprise their roles in this sequel which is actually better than the first film. The laughs come at a faster and better pace and Joan Cusack makes a delightfully sinister villain who masquerades as a nanny, marries Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd), and wants to get her hands on the Addams Family riches. It's up too all of the Addams along with new arrival Baby Pubert to stop her. Thing and Cousin Itt are also along for the ride once again.",
         "The Addams family just got a little stranger with the addition of a new baby boy. However with the new arrival, Wednesday and Pugsley become isolated and try to kill little Pubert. With all this squabbling, Morticia sounds gets tired and seeks help from a nanny. After many failures, they settle on the sparky Debbie \u0096 although Wednesday has her suspicions. These suspicions seem to be justified whenever Debbie convinces Morticia and Gomez to send their children away to a summer camp and then marry Uncle Fester \u0096 a man so repulsive that love cannot be the reason. Many films wheel out sequels by simply adding something to the original film; often it is a child and often it doesn't work. However with this film the child is not the focus but a plot device for bringing in a nanny who in turn splits the plot. The result is a solid plot that basically retreads the mood and humour of the original film which, for fans, is not a bad thing at all. For me I enjoy the dark world of the modern Addams family and felt that the plot did enough to be more than just the frame for it. The silly dark humour works well and it produced many laughs while also achieving a consistent humorous tone. I can understand why some people don't like it because it is the sort of thing you really need to \"get\" and I \"got\" it; also slightly more uptight parents may not like the examples set their kids in the film (but f**k 'em if they can't take a joke). The cast are a major factor in the humour working. Although Fester is the focus of the film, Julia is still a real joy and his chemistry with Huston is really enjoyable and they make their lines work well. Lloyd is a perfect Fester and he is consistently funny. Cusack makes the most of her role and she fits in well with the tone of the film. Ricci yet again steals the film and her deadpan delivery is funny across the whole film. The support cast have lots of cameos and smaller roles and it is fun without being distracting to watch the faces including Kane, MacNicol, Pierce, Shalhoub, Lane and Sonnenfeld himself. Overall, if you enjoyed the first film then you'll like this, and vice versa. Personally I enjoy the darkly comic tone and consistent laughs that it produced, while the good performances across the board raise the material and provide some real joys in Julia and Ricci."

While she tries (several times) to kill Fester and make it look like an accident, Pugsley and Wednesday must battle ever-cheery camp directors and spoiled rich kids to get back to their family and warn them of Debbie's plans.",
         "A comical Gothic horror-movie-type family tries to rescue their beloved uncle from his gold-digging new love."
