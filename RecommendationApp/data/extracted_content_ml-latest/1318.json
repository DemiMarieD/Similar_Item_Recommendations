         "Saw this a few years ago and wasn't that impressed but on watching it again recently I find it's grown on me a lot. There's a lot of cliches in here, Cornwall is depicted as a crazy little world quite unlike anywhere else in Britain, where one train a week passes through town and everyone listens to hokey little local radio stations manned by oo-arr-ing rustic caricatures. There's some improbable stuff too, like a couple of people setting up a rural rave in about a day and getting a good few hundred attendees. Some of the characters are a little shallow (J.C.'s local surfing mates are little more than a chorus, pointing out what's going on now and then). The main group though, Pertwee's J.C., his girl CZJ and his old mates all have nice little problems that mess them around through the film and wind up getting resolved in quite sweet ways. Some moments of hilarity (fat, e'd-up Terry as the Silver Surfer is just cool, the rave bit in general is a fun scene), some (rather obvious) drama as J.C. and Chloe fall in and out of a relationship, building to a pacey, only slightly silly climax and a cute payoff with all the roles nicely shifted around. Doesn't really look that deeply at the issues it raises (the nature of being \"grown up\", responsibility, money vs soul, self respect and trustworthiness vs being cool and impressing your mates) but it's not really supposed to, it's just a bit of fluff without the serious surf ethos (or quality surf footage) of a Big Wednesday. It's very rooted in its time and place - the clothes, the hair, the vehicles are all right on the money, I almost feel like I really saw half these people in early nineties Cornwall, a nice feeling of familiarity which almost cancels out the patronising rural Cornish stereotypes scattered about. A bit of nostalgia for me for some happy times, and for others probably well worth watching if you don't take it too seriously, more an \"aaaah\" and a giggle than a \"wow\" though.",
         "A Beach bummer? Sorry but no - this is a fantastically easy, fun film, and ridiculously true to life for anyone who's spent any time or has any fondness for cornwall. The characters are larger than life, but all charming and not out of place in a film of stereotypes. Lovely - no it isn't going to challenge you, but i would urge you to watch it of you are in love with cornwall, bored on a wet Sunday, or your day's surfing has been called off due to lack of waves. I think critics of this film perhaps are a bit quick in their discrimination because of the 'surfing movie' genre tag that this film carries. I would urge anyone put off by that to take another look, this is not a surf film, but a British surf film, which is of course an entirely different kettle of fish... no glossy beach babes and 'dude' but quirky, hopeless overgrown teenagers living for the next swell.",
         "Even though I do live in Santa Cruz, I'm not particularly interested in surfing or surf movies, but still, I really enjoyed this one. The theme of being at a stage in life where you start wondering what you're going to do with it other than partying, what's really worthwhile in life, and what your values are struck a chord with me. It's a pretty universal one. I certainly know a lot of people that have dealt with it or are dealing with it right now. The scenery of Cornwall was gorgeous. So was a very young looking Catherine Zeta Jones. The movie is beautifully shot. It was also very humorous, especially when you know lots of people like the characters in this film. It struck me as very true to life. Ewan McGregor really made me laugh as a drug dealing hippy dude who secretly just wants to be respected. I kept thinking \"didn't I see that guy at a Dead show once?\" The whole film kind of reminded me of Santa Cruz with an English accent.",
         "A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself, Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this film, while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal. For those who don't like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest, you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in. Only Ewan, Sean and Catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape, which is why it was only released on videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached mainstream fame.",
         "My main reason for watching this film was Ewan MacGregor, me being a big fan. This is a pretty good story about a guy, dubbed J.C., not wanting to grow up, and then friends who try to encourage this. Being torn between public admiration and the commitment to his girlfriend, J.C. shows us a slice of his life. Although this film ends with every main character having gone through some dramatic moral change, it is a very enjoyable film about friends and lifestyle. Recommended for the child in all of us who doesn't want to be an adult.",
         "If you've never been surfing in cornwall, and if you think that in order for a film to be funny it has to have Ben stiller in it, then perhaps the humour in Blue juice is a bit above you! Who cares if Zita jones and McGreggor haven't got main parts, Blue Juice is wicked, great to get you in the mood for a cornwall trip, great to quote with your mates and great because zita jones dances infront of a fridge in her pants... Just watch it... If you love it then you know that you are a good person with a sense of humour and if you don't... then don't slag it off, its not your fault just go and watch meet the fockers and keep your opinions to yourself.",
         "This movie's basic charm can be attributed to my endless fascination with the Peter Pan syndrome. Add Cornwall, surfing, and a combination of Sean Pertwee and Ewan McGregor and there's something for every (living) female on the planet. Will they ever grow up? But, in point of fact, one of the reasons that I loved this movie is that I don't think I really want them to. What could be more perfect than endless days of watching the waves (or waiting for the waves, to be more precise)? (I saw Endless Summer when it came out - and have been a surfer want-to-be ever since.) Combine that with a decent fry-up, a trifle/whip cream episode, and a really sweet ending, and all I can say is WOW. I've watched it four times in the last month, and am endlessly charmed by the characters (it's obviously not easy being young in England). (Notice that I did not mention the plot.)",
         "JC is at the end of his Twenties and is living with his girlfriend Chloe in Cornwall. Three of his friends from school show up, including Terry who is about to get married. While he is supposed to have the last good time in his life, Josh tries to figure out what type of music he likes, which is odd because he's a music producer, and Dean, who sells drugs on a regular basis, must face the fact that life is not one big party. But JC has his own problems with Chloe: Will he stay with her and run a surfer coffee shop or travel around the world without her? It's another Brit movie about life lessons, turning the dreaded thirty mark (which honestly, isn't that bad), and figuring your goal, or aim in life. But wasn't everything that came out of Britain in the mid nineties about life changes and coming to terms with maturity? We had This Life, Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, Game on, Cold Feet, and everything Richard Curtis did. This is just another in the long line of this sub genre, but we have the added bonus of a couple of surfing scenes. Unfairly tagged as a Zeta Jones movie on initial release, Pertwee is brilliant, and outshines everyone else in the film. Zeta Jones is good, but she was still, ahem, riding the wave of The Darling Buds Of May. Macgregor is as impressive as expected, but hey oh, when the US released the DVD, they tagged it as a film starring Macgregor, and Zeta Jones. Look at the DVD cover, it's blooming terrible. Its ninety minutes of throwaway stuff, Agutter pops up in a bizarre cameo, and come the end, well, everyone has found themselves. OK for people who like forgotten Brit movies.....l",
         "A proper little gem of a feelgood movie, it has well wrought characters and great character portrayals. It also has production values way above it's budget. For what it is worth, England ( well, Cornwall really ! ) has never looked better, and, projected with a script of some worth, the whole movie adds up to a true mini classic. Each character's role is well explored and developed, and the level of each actor's ability is truly impressive. All it lacks is a first class music soundtrack, something which one is entitled to take for granted in a movie aimed at the market it does. A little more hot sex would not have gone amiss either !...especially with Catherine Zeta-Jones in the driving seat !",
         "It is no easy life, if you're nearing thirties and you are a British surfer! Soon you'll have to settle down and make out your living somehow. In 'Blue Juice' yesterday has come suddenly to JC, who is played by Sean Pertwee \u0096 an actor who looks a bit like Robert Redford or Graham Chapman. His buddies are in same situation: not young anymore, penniless and without proper job. JC was once a great surfer, who now has to leave his post with dignity. He has to go surfing once more even if it's dangerous. By successfully completing his final task he would leave the field as a legend and also renew his relationship with his girlfriend Chloe. Quite considerable supporting actors for this film are Ewan McGregor and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who play decent roles but are shadowed by Pertwee's performance. The now available DVD-cover does not present Pertwee, but Zeta-Jones and McGregor on the cover, which is somewhat misleading. If you wanted to see Catherine and Ewan on the movie, you'll have to accept that they're not the stars in this one, although you'll see them in quite many scenes. The film is in its aspects very retrospective. Marc Bolan rocks on a record player and the characters are dreaming about King Arthur and his knights. As a curiosity, 'Blue Juice' is an excellent chance to see Zeta-Jones playing a young woman and in some scenes she's even furious, which is quite exciting."
