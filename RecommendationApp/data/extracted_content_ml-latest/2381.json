      "synopsis": "Police Academy head Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) decides that the police force is overworked and understaffed, so he comes up with the idea of recruiting civilian volunteers to work side-by-side with his officers in a program called \"Citizens On Patrol\" (COP). Fellow alumni Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg) and his friends Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait), Sweetchuck (Tim Kazurinsky), Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey), and Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook) are in charge of training the civilians. The civilians include the enormous obese Tommy \"House\" Conklin (Tab Thacker), gung-ho senior citizen Lois Feldman (Billie Bird), and two skateboarding delinquents Kyle (David Spade) and Arnie (Brian Backer). However, the veteran academy trainer, Captain Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey) believes \"the concept of citizens doing police work is asinine\" and plans to take over Lassard's job, and that's why Harris is determined to see the COP program fail, and to work on a plan to discredit Mahoney (whom Harris has had a grudge against every since the very first movie). When Lassard leaves on an overseas conference, Harris, along with his dull-witted right hand man Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey), are put in charge of the academy and Harris immedietely plots to make the COP volunteers quit and leave the police work to the officers. The volunteers do well in their training, Mrs. Feldman excelling in firing Tackleberry's .44 Magnum. In training for water safety and drowning victim rescue, Zed \"rescues\" a cadet but experiences a personal loss of his no longer functioning watch, and mourns the death of the cartoon character inside of it saying it was the last thing he ever stole before joining the academy. Through his loss Zed gains a love interest, Laura (Corinne Bohrer), a reporter/photographer who has come to the academy to view Lassard's COP program and takes a fancy to former gang leader Zed. Unfortunately Harris ruins the moment and insults Zed and Laura, which causes Zed to replace Harris's deoderant with mace. In the next scene while Zed instructs the volunteers on the very important matter of how to correctly eat a donut, Harris is seen wearing a medical device suspending his arms in the air. Despite the pranks played upon him during the various training exercises the volunteers take, Harris is determined to make the Citizens on Patrol program fail. Meanwhile, Jones learn that volunteers House, Kyle, and Arnie believe themselves ready to go out and catch criminals, so Jones, Mahoney, Hightower, and Tackleberry play a prank on the boys to make them take their training more seriously. Mahoney and Jones fake an arrest with Hightower playing a voodoo priest, and Tackleberry playing a hockey-masked chainsaw wielding maniac to successfully scare the boys. The next day, after being yelled at again by Captain Harris and being called a disgrace, Zed is comforted again by Laura, who says she thinks he's perfect. After several volunteers foil an undercover police sting, the Citizens on Patrol program is suspended, much to Harris's delight. While Harris gives a tour of his precinct to a group of foreign dignitaries, the numb-skull Proctor messes up and is tricked by the inmates into releasing every inmate at the Precinct 19 jail, including a team of ninjas, and a redneck thug gang leader (Randall \"Tex\" Cobb), who had taken Zed's place as leader of the gang back after Zed's arrest in Police Academy 2. When Lassard's officers hear of the jailbreak, the COP volunteers are dispatched along with the regular officers to catch the escaped felons, which include a team of ninja warriors. After Jones, Hightower and Lois Feldman stop a robbery, Mahoney and Tackleberry take a high speed air balloon to chase after another group of robbers. As a result, the felons are all recaptured. Meanwhile, House, Kyle, and Arnie save Harris and Proctor from drowning in a river. And Zed impresses Laura by saving Sweetchuck's life after they both fall out of a plane in mid-air. The several police chiefs who came to witness Lassard's program in action congratulate and compliment Lassard on his program and his officers.",

         "Why is this movie rated so low? I admit that it is the fourth in the series and that is getting pretty ridiculous but this one has many memorable moments in it. Also where else can you go see Sharon Stone, David Spade, and a speacial appearance by a young kid at the time named Tony Hawke. No where else can you get so many people in one of their first movies. It is also still highly entertaining and causes me to laugh often. This is where you should stop watching the series however b/c they lose Steve Guttenburg and he is the only reason the series kept on for as long as it did. So don't give this a low score. Help it get out of the lowest 100 where other real horrible films belong.",
         "So what's happened so far? A gaggle of society's goofiest citizens have taken advantage of a new policy to loosen hiring standards at the police force and actually made it through despite efforts from all directions to get them thrown out. They embark on their first assignment, which is to turn around Commandant Lassard's beloved precinct 16, which has been dubbed the worst precinct in the city and given 30 days to turn around or suffer some major employee turnover, a fate which is relentlessly helped along by the eternally butt- kissing Captain Mauser. They display a spectacular feat of water-borne police work, saving the academy and then return in the next movie to beat the city's other police academy when it turns out that the governor decides it's not worth the money to keep them both open. Oh, and of course you all realize who is in this thing, right? None less than Sharon Stone, David Spade in his first film, and Tony Hawk in an early stunt-skateboarding role! You gotta see this! This time, Commandant Lassard has come up with a scheme he calls Citizens on Patrol (C.O.P. Get it? Get it?), in which he elaborates slightly on the plot of the original movie. You see, the police force has been stretched a little too thin and the public has developed a negative opinion of them due to the fact that they can't be everywhere at all times to stop every single crime in the city. So the natural solution, of course, is to train the public as deputy police officers and basically have briefly trained undercover cops all over the city. In fact, so close is the resemblance to the first movie that we are even treated to a couple characters who are forced to join the police academy or face jail time \u0096 an idea suggested, of course, by Mahoney himself. This is the best part of the movie, by the way. There is a hilarious gang of skateboarding punks who are disturbing the peace left and right, headed by none other than David Spade, who is a hardened urban predator if I've ever seen one. Thug life, baby!! Sharon Stone also has a relatively small role in the film, although probably one of the ons that she would like to forget about, and Lieutenant Harris is back after being gone for the last two movies. All of the other relevant cast members return, with the addition of a new group of misfits, like the token fat black guy, David Spade and his idiot skateboarder friend, and Tackleberry's FATHER-in-law. Remember that guy? Who is always gleefully punching out his son? I can't wait until the grandparents start joining! But don't worry, until then we have Mrs. Feldman to hold us over. Here's this sweet old lady living in a nursing home/military barracks and who has more of a love of all things camouflaged than Tackleberry himself. In fact, I was waiting the whole movie for her to tell her that she's his long lost mother, but no such luck. Something went wrong with the screen writing in there somewhere, but ultimately she turns out to be one of the most consistently funny characters in the movie. She's played with a good-natured smile by Billie Bird, who clearly enjoyed herself while making the movie. You can always tell when the actors are having a good time, and it always makes the movie better, which is good because this movie needs a lot of help! Of course, it's not much different than the last three movies as far as being worth watching. Bud and his father are still trading punches and it's still more groan-inducing than laugh- inducing, people are still accidentally wandering into the Blue Oyster Club, which hasn't been funny for three movies by now (Proctor inadvertently wandering in naked was the high point of this gag, but also the point where it becomes the most clear that the joke has lost its steam), and Jones is still doing that Bruce Lee impersonation which was funny in the first movie when I was a kid, but as an adult not so much\u0085 But, Callahan has a great wet t-shirt scene that makes the whole movie worthwhile! Oh, and was Mahoney's mischievous grin ever amusing? That poor guy, man. His reputation has for some reason become so tarnished that he is seen by most of the public as even more of a washed up has-been than, umm, well no one else really comes to mind. Bill Paxton? Nah, he's cool, I think. I never needed to forgive him for Weird Science, but Guttenburg unfortunately has a whole string of bad sequels to make up for, and Cocoon and Short Circuit are just not gonna cut it! At any rate, super-gluing the loudspeaker to Harris' face was funny, but why they missed out on the opportunity to have Harris screaming through it at high volume at the doctors in the hospital I just can't understand. The screenwriters are not scoring many points in this one! But still, this is one of the better Police Academies so far. This one and part 3 are the best ones in the series that I've seen so far, despite the hilarious 1980s badness (there's a boot- legging crime lord, for example, who operates his illegal warehouse standing around with a fistful of cash and a hula hoop around his shoulders), but there definitely are some fun gags. Harris macing his armpits is one is one of the more memorable gags in the whole series, along with Mauser getting his hands glued to his hair, and I have to admit that I enjoyed some of the scenes of the original recruits trying to recruit the public for the new C.O.P. program. It's not a good movie, but it's a good Police Academy movie!",
         "\"Citizens On Patrol\", the fourth installment of the Police Academy is again shaped in the same mold as it's follow-ups: the slapstick, the crude humor, and sexual innuendos. It's too bad that the writers of these movies couldn't think of something different than the same old thing, but what works works! Kudos again to Michael Winslow and his vocal effects. Also thanks goes to the writers for giving Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait) a new love.",
         "OK. here we go. This movie has the same feel of the original, which was if i say so myself, a funny movie. this one, is the best sequel and is just as funny. It's pretty much the same thing as all of the sequels but It works, it made me laugh. The plot is, lassard is making a citizens on patrol program, which is a bunch of citizens are put through training and act like cops or something like that. I suck at remembering plots. It's a police academy sequel, It doesnt need a good plot. Our good friends Harris and Proctor try to ruin them, and some of the citizens in the movie were pretty funny. This was the best of all of the average to bad sequels the original police academy movie got. If you liked the original or ANY of the sequels you should pick this one up. 7/10",
         "The police academy misfits are trying to help make Commandant Lassard's \"Citizens on Patrol\" neighborhood watch program work. Jealous Captain Harris does everything he can to make sure it fails. Most of the gang is here and likable as usual. Glad to see G.W. Bailey back from the first movie. Oddly, Art Metrano's sidekick from the last two sequels is still in this and is now Bailey's sidekick. I actually think it works better this way. Film debut of David Spade as a skateboarding recruit. Sharon Stone plays the requisite pretty woman Steve Guttenberg works his charms on. Love the '80s fads and clothing. The series is running on empty here but there are still some funny parts here and there. Bobcat Goldthwait gets most of the best lines. This was the last of the series to feature Bobcat or Guttenberg. The series really shouldn't have tried to continue without them.",
         "This is a hard Academy movie to define. The humour is generally more smutty, keeping up the standards of the original, yet it also has awful gags about people slipping on skateboards and pidgeons secreting on policemen's shoulders. There are also jokes about farting, a sure sign of desperation. On the plus side, we see the return of G.W.Bailey as Captain Harris. That's about it on the plus side. The whole film looks rushed and is mostly set at night or on grey skied days that make it look awful. Not a pleasant film to watch. However, the public, including myself, flocked to see it. But, hey, you don't know what you're gonna get until you have paid your admission.",
         "I'll admit, I enjoyed these \"Police Academy\" movies back in the eighties. Honestly, I really only have seen the first two in the theatre. The third one I saw on cable TV. Now that I've bought the box set on DVD, I can honestly say that it is at this 4th sequel of the \"Police Academy\" films, that they really should have stopped right here. A lot of the humor is predictable and (most annoyingly) often repeated. For example, Winslow (Larvell Jones), was doing his silly \"karate man\" humor excessively though many of the \"Police Academy\" films. If he only did this in one film, the humorous impact would have been cherished more. The first three \"Police Academy\" films are the best. Taking this predictable slapstick into four more follow-up films (with totally forgettable stories, was just a bit too much.) On a positive note, \"Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol\" starred Corinne Bohrer as Laura. What a gorgeous blonde babe she is! And also, I'll have to admit that on the documentaries of the making of the \"Police Academy\" films, Leslie Easterbrook is still quite an attractive looking woman. Marian Ramsey still looks good, too.",
         "I am loving this movie very nicely. I love the scene where the pigeon drops its shite on the policeman's shoulder. I split my pant laughing at this. I am still laughing now. I also like the woman with the big tits. She has very big tits, indeed...Nice. Pant splittingly amusing. I am laughing at the farting noises made by the black man. Very amusing. Pant splittingly funny. I am laughing at the dog sniffing the crotch of the policeman. Very amusing. Nice. Pant splitter. I am laughing at the golf ball smashing through the car window. Very amusing. Nice. I split my pant. Such was the hilarity. I must go now as I am urinating due to laughter as I think of this superb movie. I have wet my pant. Damn. I must go now.",
         "This one and part three are the best ones in the series that I've seen. Harris macing his armpits is one is one of the more memorable gags in the series. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. It's not a good movie, but it is a good Police Academy movie. The acting is very effective. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. We watch here a deep study of the rural countryside of the deep America. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story.",
         "Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, Michael Winslow, David Graf, Marion Ramsay, Leslie Easterbrook, Tim Kazurinsky, Bobcat Goldthwait, Brian Tochi, G.W. Bailey, Lance Kinsey and George Gaynes star in this 1987 comedy sequel. In this installment, Commandant Lassard (Gaynes) begins a program called, Citizens On Patrol where members of the community help stop crime and learn techniques the police use. Mahoney (Guttenberg), Hightower (Smith), Jones (Winslow), Tackleberry (Graf), Hooks (Ramsay), Callahan (Easterbrook), Sweetchuck (Kazurinsky) and Zed (Goldthwait) help instruct them. Bailey returns as Harris who thinks the program is a bad idea, Kinsey returns as Proctor who now works for Harris and Tochi appears as Nogata who is reunited with Callahan. Sharon stone (Basic Instinct) is also featured as reporter, Claire who ends up with Mahoney, David Spade (Tommy Boy) plays skateboarder, Kyle and Zed also finds romance with a photographer (Corinne Bohrer). This is a decent sequel, it's nice to see Bailey back as Harris, but it's too bad it's Guttenberg's last appearance in the series. I still recommend this."
