         "Since I have always been a Christian from childhood and agreeably conspire to my faith today, I am always curious about what causes others to \"be saved\" later in life. \"The Rapture\" tells this story with fascinating insights into the modern Christian perspective and what scares the public about its predictions. Mimi Rogers (in a heart-wrenching performance) plays Sharon, a telephone operator who leads a tedious and extremely boring life by day, but resorts to group sex and orgies to add excitement to her nightlife. She discovers Christianity through people pamphleting at her door and other employees in her office she never cared to talk to before. They use the imagery of a pearl to describe their experience of being saved, and Sharon longs to discover what it is about this religion that can bring fulfillment to her own life. David Duchovney, before his stint on \"The X-Files,\" co-stars as Sharon's boyfriend and later husband she meets through her reckless \"dates,\" and whom she induces to join her spiritual quest to find God. After their marriage and birth of their daughter, her faith is tested to intense extemes in ways I would not dare describe, but can honestly say are truly harrowing. I was surprised that, even though I am a devout Christian, I was not offended by this film, what can be seen as a blatantly sacreligious movie. I think every religious individual should see it to get a better understanding of what they conspire to, as well as how others may conceive of their faith. \"The Rapture\" is not a tame flick, and does not shy away from controversial discourse, but all in all, this is a rewarding picture that gets its viewers to think about their lives and what they believe in. No doubt you will be entranced. Rating: Three stars and a half.",
         "Several of the cast members of this movie have noted that the budget pretty much ran out near the end. Fortunately by then you are so fascinated to find out how it will all end the shortcuts are easy to ignore. This is one you remember. There's a certain type of convert - to religion, politics, you name it - who is so sure of him or herself they just can't ever stop and question whether they've substituted an arrogant certainty where faith and humility should reside. Seldom is this zealotry depicted in film, and if it is usually some secondary character wears the label, all the better to comment on or contrast with the actions of the main characters. Here that character is front and center. The sin of pride born of absolute certainty is Mimi Rogers real co-star. Rogers is so effective here because her zealotry is low-key. She is soft spoken and serene, a lovely woman. Only gradually do we see how deep rooted is her need to understand God in her own way and how convinced she is that she's doing it absolutely the right way. Movies never, ever take a certain type of religious conversion all the way to such a logical conclusion. For me, that's what makes this movie such a stunner. I've always been sorry this film never got it's due in the theatrical release, but the subject matter, coming after an opening act glimpse of Rogers' empty sexual adventuring, probably made it a double whammy for timid theater owners. If it were released next week somehow I don't think it would be nearly as ignored as it was. I only made an effort to see it because Roger Ebert paid it some special attention in his review, and I'm glad I did. This movie needs a DVD release, because it definitely is an overlooked and memorable film that should prompt many a conversation about worthwhile matters of the spirit. As I write this there is a certain amount of criticism of Clint Eastwood's \"Million Dollar Baby\" coming from various corners, including one film critic who claims that Hollywood dislikes religion. \"The Rapture\" seems to me a perfect example of a movie designed to start useful discussions about what it means to be outwardly \"religious\" in an \"us vs. them\" mindset rather than truly, inclusively spiritual. I don't recall any public commentary about this movie when it came out at all, yet I'd say it is far more the provocative of the two.",
         "A haunting movie -- one that lingers in the mind (and the heart) for a long time afterwards. Mimi Rogers turns in a stunning performance as a woman trapped in a cycle of dull work and duller play, whose life is transformed twice -- first by a religious conversion, and then by coming face to face with the literal meaning of that conversion. She is incandescent in her belief, and in the movie's final scenes, takes on the epic proportions of a Job or King Lear. You may be puzzled, conflicted, or even offended by what the movie \"means,\" but you won't be able to walk away from it untouched.",
         "I like many different kinds of movies, but this is one of my very favorites because it's among the rare few that really touched me. The film takes on a HUGE subject (the price of devotion) in a very direct and simple way, and truly brought me inside the heroine's world. I think a lot of us can identify with Sharon's yearning to get something more out of life; I mean, who can claim this is really the best of all possible worlds? (Look around!) The scene where Sharon breaks down after showering in scalding water, weeping that she's tired of all the pain and emptiness, is unforgettable. Mimi Rogers plays the part with complete conviction, and I especially like her glowing serenity in the middle section in which she's saved. (The actress' delivery is occasionally a bit flat, but I actually think that's brilliant. Roger's isn't playing a rocket scientist, just a lost, ordinary woman.) As for the poster who made the brilliant observation that the character \"looks just as bored and unfulfilled by random group sex as she is by answering telephones all day,\" um, that's the point. In the first group sex scene Sharon enjoys herself, yet she eventually leaves the swingers scene when she feels unfulfilled. I also love the sequence where the born-again Sharon is at work, proselytizing The Word to people who've only called Directory Assistance for phone numbers. (\"Well I'm sure you're in a hurry, but don't you think you could take time out to get to know your Lord and Savior?\") The scene where Sharon tells her old party pal that she's met a really great guy (Jesus) is priceless as well, and the scene where she's pulled over by a cop near the end and breaks down is extremely powerful. The film does look a little low budget, especially near the end, but it's a movie about ideas and emotion, not spectacle. It's a thoughtful and thorough film, with an articulate point of view that doesn't judge its characters who enjoy evangelical faith...which is rather unlike the judgmental view of the God we're usually presented with.",
         "Uncommon mix of sex and religion is hard hitting and thought provoking. Mimi Rogers, giving easily the finest performance of 1991 (and many other years), was completely overlooked by the industry, and that's unfortunate for us. She is so superb in this film, that it is inconceivable that she doesn't work more than she does. She is supported by a fine cast, most notably, Kimberly Cullum, as Mary. It's too bad that Mimi Rogers isn't given more roles in Hollywood; but we do have this performance, in this film, and I highly recommend it!",
         "The final scenes which show the end of the world and the apocalypse and the passing of all the biblical prophecies (the four horsemen, the trumpets etc) are NOT hallucinatory. They are supposed to be real not inside the main character's head. Look at the way they are depicted, she is in a police station, and the people around her react to these things, another woman prisoner begins singing \"hark the herald angel\", the bars fall magically off the cell doors, the TV that is on starts showing the 4 horsemen and angelic figures, and we hear the sound of the trumpet and see everyone: the sheriffs, the prisoners reacting to this. The point of the film is this: that religious fanaticism may be frightening. But what would be EVEN MORE frightening: what if the religious zealots depicted in the film, what if they turned out not to be misguided or wrong in their beliefs but to be RIGHT: that the Book of Revelations actually WILL come true! This is what makes the film so terrifying. The very final scene where the 2 remaining characters, Will Patton and Mimi Rogers are in Heaven, shows that in the end even though the world has ended and the coming of the Apocalypse has passed, and the Second Reign of Heaven has come, that in the end, the Mimi Rogers character finally realizes that in spite of her previous choices, that she decides human free will and the right to question, to choose (i.e. free speech) must be paramount, EVEN if this means she is condemned to purgatory forever. So she chooses NOT to embrace God, this is why Will Patton suddenly vanishes, he chooses to and goes to Heaven, but she allows her earlier doubts, about how God can allow evil and suffering, to prevent her from accepting God as the Saviour. She accepts He exists, but will not follow Him. So THIS is the film's ultimate message: that human freewill may triumph even against the strongest powers. I know this may be hard to accept, but it does not make the film anti-Christian but thought provoking. I am Catholic and was not offended by the film at all, as it raises important issues. What is sad is that it is clear from previous comments on this site is that it went straight over many people's heads. Read more, attend more University courses, is my advice.",
         "This is one of those films that come along in a great while that both enthralls and disturbs you. Mimi Rodgers plays a woman caught up in depressing job as a directory assistance operator with her only escape, the sexual games and encounters she has with her lover. Driven to seek a better life, she is drawn into a religious cult that has her believing the Apocalypse is near. She is chosen by the group to go out to the rugged landscape and wait for a sign from God. What happens there is the remarkable and torturous journey of a woman brought to madness and questioning all that she believes in. This film haunts you long afterwards like witnessing a roadside accident. You are mesmerized by the horror of it while at the same time wanting to turn away. This film is powerful, provocative and deeply moving. A must see for serious film lovers.",
         "One of the most intriguing movies I've ever seen and most underrated I might add. I'm not religious but this movie is mesmerizing from the performances to the script and poses a lot of interesting questions about life as well as religion. Why Mimi Rogers didn't become a Star after this, I don't know. Now she's reduced to movie to movies like Lost in Space and guest appearances on X-files with her costar of Rapture, David Duchovney. Check this out. You won't be sorry.",
         "Before my praises for The Rapture, first a scolding at New Line Cinema. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME on you for marketing the home video of this very important film as if it were a soft-core sex romp. The original artwork for the film captured its essence very well (the soundtrack on CD has the original artwork), but the VHS video box cover on the front shows Mimi Rogers looking like she had the biggest...well, you know...sexual thrill of her life. The back cover shows a shirtless David Duchovny (but with a look on his face like a deer caught in the headlights). The cover says \"exploring a woman's sexual and spiritual awakening.\" Excuse me, but Mimi Rogers' character seems to already be well educated in sex by revealing that she likes to swing with friend Patrick Bauchau. Sure, there is some sex in the first part of the film, but the story as a whole is 95% about the spiritual part. I'd love to yell at the person who got the job of marketing that cover and say how it really is an insult to people's intelligence in general. The Current DVD cover unfortunately makes it look like a religious family film...a big mistake. Should have kept the original artwork (again, see the soundtrack CD cover for that). NOW, for the praise. The Rapture is one of those rare films that refuses to compromise and doesn't apologize if it offends one's religious beliefs. Mimi Rogers is a telephone operator with a very unremarkable life. Even her sexual experiences with her friend seem to be boring her. She eventually overhears co-workers talking about \"The Boy\" and she is intrigued by the secrecy surrounding him. She eventually gets involved with this religious group and as time passes, gets married, has a daughter, and continues her religious life. Then things get a bit....bizarre. It leads to a conclusion that may anger those who are devout and get a a lot of respect from those that feel there are many things we just shouldn't settle for in our existence. I'm not an Academy Award nut, but the fact that Mimi Rogers was overlooked for a nomination is \"sacrilege\"...excuse me, but in reviewing something like this film some puns are inevitable! The one scene that most everyone I know refers to specifically is the one where Mimi confesses a crime to policeman Will Patton on the side of a road. Watching her emotional pain as she cries out how she can't love God anymore tears me up every time I see it, and it leaves you in a weakened state for the rest of the film. And the rest of the film will have you in a state of amazement right through to its fade. I was so impressed by the uncompromising conclusion and while some may feel that maybe Mimi didn't really win in the end, I feel she did. I too want to know why people think God solely has us here to worship, worship, worship -- at one point Mimi even asks co-workers \"Isn't that a bit selfish?\" While we don't get the answers we seek in this film, at least it challenges our minds and gets us talking. I can't recall any other film that has an effect to such an extent as The Rapture. Whether you are very serious in your religious beliefs or are open to all sides of discussion, The Rapture will unnerve, exhilarate, and leave you truly touched in some way.",
         "I saw this when it came out in 1991, and again recently, and it amazes me how many people see this as a purely pro-Christian film. I've always thought it was as much an indictment of fundamentalist Christianity, as \"pro-Christian.\" Consider this: if it is such a pro-Christian film, why does the protagonist unapologetically refute Christianity at the end? And ask yourself: will this film really convert any non-believers? (Mimi Rogers' character begins the film empty inside, and ends the film just as empty-- that will hardly convince anyone who is looking for answers.) The Rapture presents a simplified version of the millennial view that fundamentalist Christians believe and so fundamentalists see it as pro-Christian. Conversely, if you come to this film as an atheist or agnostic you will get all the bitter distaste religion already gives you in spades. I suspect anyone with a purely open mind (including non-fundamentalist Christians) will come away confused, and ponder the film for some time (indeed, that's how I felt the first time I saw it). This film was the first to give me the notion that fundamentalist Christians have essentially given up on this world, and can't wait for The Rapture: Mimi and her co-believers have a bunker mentality, they gather together, listen to the young prophet, perhaps try to convert others, and are filled with joy that the world is coming to an end (are their lives that empty that they can't wait for the world to end?) I was reminded of this again recently (in 2006) when Israel attacked Hezbollah in Lebanon, and hundreds of posts appeared on Christian message boards from Christians who \"felt like dancing\" because they thought it was the beginning of the end. Such a small view of God. I would think God was infinite, and thus the universe were infinite, rather than revolving around one tiny planet, with everything predetermined, and the end coming like a carefully crafted stage-play, with the true believers cowering before the Lord, praying that their sinful neighbors all go to Hell."
