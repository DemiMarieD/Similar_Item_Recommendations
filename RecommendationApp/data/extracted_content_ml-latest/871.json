         "This movie was very good, it surprised me. You usually see a lot of romantic movies in which two people are soulmates they meet and they live happily ever after. This movie took it to the next level by showing you that just because your soulmates doesn't mean it will work out. Plus it showed it to you in a Hilarious way with Dead Poets, Family and friends...even the main characters telling they're story. Tim Curry is always superb so it was an excellent movie the only problem was the cinematography it was pretty crude but for being a low budget movie it shows. Still it's a good movie I give it 5 stars.",
         "Cupid's helper (Tim Roth) has been assigned to bring two people together. Steve (Billy Campbell) is a college lecturer who is working toward a doctorate in Renaissance literature. He is the consummate romantic, having once played Romeo on stage, where he changed the ending to let both of the lovers live! Steve especially loves poetry and has been known to use classic rhymes to woo his women. Megan (Jennifer Grey) is a pediatrician whose most recent boyfriend was an ego-driven fellow doctor. These two attractive people meet at the costume party of close friends and they are smitten. Steve takes Megan out on boat, where he has planned a romantic dinner on a starlit night. They soon become quite close and move in together. But, as Cupid's aid states, they have met in past-lives and, as a couple, have always gone up in smoke. As this is their last chance, will they make it this time? This is really a wonderful movie for those who love romance and, considering its small budget, is even more noteworthy in its success. Roth is great as the envoy for Cupid, making the most of his scenes, and the very handsome Campbell and the lovely Grey are also just right in their roles as the couple of destiny. The remainder of the acting crew is nice, too, with some stars making significant and funny cameos. As for the script, it shows plenty of imagination and refinement while the costumes, sets, and production are fine, too. All romcom fans are urged to get this film immediately, from the store or the internet. It is \"knot\" an overstatement to say that you will adore this sweet flick.",
         "This movie I found totally out of the blue on a search for Tim Curry movies. At first since it was a low-budget movie I didn't have any expectations for it. But I thought it was good! Tim Curry made me laugh and Bill Campbell and Jennifer Grey together were adorable. If you're in the mood to just watch something entertaining and cute I'd recommend this. The only thing about the movie I didn't like was the other couples scenes. I thought that the way they did it was too random, when it first happens it's kind of confusing, but it wasn't that bad.",
         "It was a lot of fun. It was very well-acted and written, except the end. I didn't like the ending, a little hokey. Still, it was more honest than most romantic comedies, and it was short. I like the documentary style, and the switching back in time. They almost overused the latter, but they restrained themselves just enough. All in all, not bad. Was it ever released in theaters?",
         "confession #1: I do not usually enjoy romantic comedies. confession #2: I actually enjoyed one. The movie? Lover's Knot. It's a simple story between two people who are destined to fall in love with each other(duh) as told by Cupid's helper. But what makes this simple story interesting is HOW it is told. Documentary-style interviews of their parents to friends to even the (deceased) romantic poets! Kooky but refreshing than the average romance comedies which have the characters instantly falling for each other. Watch it."

Add to this the conflicting advice of Steve's roommate, Nigel and Steve's temptation for Cheryl, a sensual coed, and it begins to look like this is one more lifetime Steve and Megan won't spend together..."],
