         "content": "Attempting to finish film school, a director doing her film about a serial killer killing his victims on urban legends starts to realize that a serial killer is running around behind the scenes killing off the crew, and must stop the madman before killing off everyone on the film.\r\n\r\nThis here was a pretty surprising entry. One of the things it does well is that it really features a lot of suspenseful work at times as this makes a hard time of determining if what's being seen is real or just being shot for the movie. It plays the movie-within-a-movie trick to nice effect, since it features enough to make hard to distinguish one from the other including it's wonderful opening sequence that takes a while before realizing after the fact it's been faked, a sequence where the assembled cast watch the dailies only for a strange cut-shot to play where one of the cast is viciously stalked and killed is screened where all but one thinking it to be shot for the film but the other positive that it's real and a later scene where a murder done during the recording of a scream-test loud enough to drown out the victim's own being great scenes. Even going away from that formula, there\u2019s some rather fun stalking here from the bathroom chase featuring the woman trying to escape from the killer out into the alleyway or a thrilling chase through the recording studio and out into the surrounding countryside and pool while an attack at a carnival ride hidden by the darkness and fog comes off rather nice as well. The final confrontation in the movie-set graveyard setting is just fun, being creepy, exciting and all-around a blast with the true revelation and the different twists featured throughout make for a nice time here. The last big feature here is a really nice and healthy mix amongst the kills, which along with the mask worn are the film's rather good parts. This one here only has a few flaws to it. The main one here is that the main explanation for the killing has a lot of ways for how to interpret it, and it feels just too clumsy and unrealistic to be considered as believable. The fact that the violence is toned down from anything that it should have, since, for all the creativity displayed in the kills, it isn't very bloody and with a couple of kills that could've been in here. These are the same thing that really should've fixed by taking more of those and making them more bloody. It would've taken out a mild flaw in the film rather simply. The last flaw in here is the film's maddening ability to switch between the film shoot and the real world. It's fun at times, but there's also the fact that the film tries to be clever with changing around the two and it gets a little harder to defend the longer they go on. These here are the film's flaws.\r\n\r\nRated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and a sex scene.",

      "synopsis": "A plane is flying through a heavy storm that is filled with rowdy college students coming back from Hawaii after spring break. One couple heads into the lavatory for sex when the girl sees the words \"you're going down\" written in red on a mirror. The plane starts a descent, and the couple exits the bathroom to find all of the passengers dead and the killer, a flight attendent wielding a knife, attacks them. The couple runs into the cockpit to find both pilots dead. While the boy tries to hold the killer steward off by holding the door closed, the girl gets in the pilot seat and yells \"mayday!\" over the radio. Suddenly... Toby the director yells \"Cut!\" as the camera pulls back to reveal that this whole thing is a horror movie filmed by a small college crew at Alpine University. Toby yells at his crew for not getting the shot right as well as the blond girl, Sandra Petruzzi (Jessica Cauffiel), over her motivation. When the work is completed for the day, the sound recorder Amy Mayfied (Jennifer Morrison), walks home to her doom where it's revealed that she is a aspiring filmmaker wanting to write and direct her own movie some day. The next day, Amy is in class with other film students listing to the talk of the Alfred Hitchcock Film Award and the thesis film projects. Walking back to her dorm after her late night class, Amy is given a ride by Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine), the campus security guard. The two of them talk about Pam Grier and that they are both fans of her movies. Amy tells Reese that she has a film due, but cannot think of a good story, Reese tells her that a few years ago she was the security guard at Pendleton University where a serial killer killed eight students there, but Amy dismisses it as the local urban legend of the area. Later, Amy visits her film class teacher, Professor Solomon (Hart Bochner), and gives him her idea about making a film about a killer who kills people basing them on urban legends. The professor thinks that its a great idea. That evening, film student Travis Stark (Matthew Davis) is in a local bar with his girlfriend Lisa and they talk about his films. As Lisa orders two more drinks, someone slips a pill in her drink. Travis leaves to go to work on his latest movie, and Toby (Aston Mount) walks over to Lisa to hit on her. Lisa leaves, telling him that he can pay for the drinks. She stumbles into a coatroom where an unseen person sneaks up behind her and throws a plastic bad over her head. Lisa wakes up sometime later that night in a bathtub full of ice with a wound on her stomach and sees one of her kidney's is on a plate nearby. Lisa sees someone in the other room of what appears to be an abandoned building. She crawls out of the tub and shuts the door. Lisa calls 911 on her cell phone, but the operator thinks that its a prank call and hangs up on her. Lisa tries crawling out a window when the unseen person breaks in and pulls her back in, and breaking the window. The window is slammed shut on Lisa's neck, beheading her. The next day, Amy asks Travis if he can look at her approved script. When Amy tells some fellow students about her movie, Toby pulls her aside and accuses her of stealing his horror genre and says that no one will take the Hitchcock Award away from him which he feels belongs to him and him only. Amy goes to see Travis who is upset that he got a C- on his film and asks if she knows an available cinematographer. On the set, three of the film student crew, Stan Washington (Anthony Anderson), Dirk Reynolds (Michael Bacall), as well as Sandra fake an accident in which Sandra plays dead with some blood makeup on her head. After Amy describes the scene to Sandra, the cinematographer Schorm \"Simon\" Jabuscko (Marco Hofschneider), shows up with his camera. As people are leaving for the night, Sandra returns to the set for her dorm room keys. Someone sneaks into the studio and attaches a microphone to a camera and approaches her. The next day in the screening room, Amy and her friends watch the latest footage they shot. But the footage changes to feature Sandra being chased and killed by the unseen killer. Amy thinks that it is real, but the others think is another of Sandra's practical jokes. Later that day, Amy and the others get news that Travis killed himself. Another film student, named Graham Manning (Joseph Lawrence), talks to Amy, assuring her that Sandra is probably in Los Angeles filming a bit part on the series ER. Amy goes to the campus tower where it is said that Travis shot himself over his bad grade. There, Amy has a run-in with Travis' identical twin brother, Trevor (also Mathew Davis). He tells Amy that he thinks that Travis did not kill himself, but he tells her not to tell anybody that she saw him. That evening, Amy films a scene where the students count down to the new year and scream. While Simon is outside to smoke a cigarette, the killer, wearing a fencing mask with a hooded dark-blue sweat suit, attacks him with his own camera and beats him to death with it. Amy, having heard the last part of the killer, goes outside where Simon got attacked, but the killer and Simon's body are gone. Amy notices a security camera and she goes to Reese to ask to borrow the tapes of the last hour or so of what the cameras recorded. Amy watches the tape in the studio and sees Simon killed by the hooded fencing mask killer. But the killer appears and breaks into the studio. She locks the door to the booth, but the killer breaks through. Amy is chased by the killer through the building and to the dock where she dives into a sewer piper. While running through the sewer tunnel, Amy finds Reese and the two of them go back to the recording studio, but the tapes are gone. Reese is skeptic to Amy's claims about being attacked and also says that she cannot do anything without evidence. The next morning, Amy secretly meets with Trevor again where she tells him that she thinks that Sandra and Simon are dead, but Trevor tells her that he cannot go to the police for he has a bad relationship with the local authorities for they will not believe him either. Amy thinks that the killer might be one of the students up for the Hitchcock Award. That evening, Amy and colleague Vanessa Valdeon (Eva Mendes), the boom operation on the film (whom clearly has a crush on the straight Amy), head to the ride Merry Minders, the location of the Tunnel of Terror carnival ride scene (where the urban legend has real dead bodies in a carnival fun ride). Stan and Dick arrive there to set up dead bodies, and Amy asks Graham why be brought along the odd PA Kevin (Derek Aasland). Graham is upset that Amy is pulling a power trip in front of everyone, and he leaves. Amy sees Trevor watching them from the trees, nods to him, and tells everyone that they can leave the set to get something to eat. When Stan goes off into the tunnel to fix more lights, the killer hits him on the head and electrocutes him with a sliced cable. Next, the killer attacks Dirk and pushes him against a control box, electrocuting him too. The ride's railcar stops with Amy inside and she walks out the rest of the way. Amy finds Dirk dead and is chased by the killer to the entrance where Reese is waiting. She ventures into the tunnel, but the killer has fled. The police arrive and carry away the dead Stan and Dirk while they take Amy away for questioning. The next day, Trevor meets with Amy in her room where he tells her that he followed Graham but lost him the previous night and cannot rule him out being the killer. They lie down together on Amy's bed where Amy falls asleep and has an intimate dream of her with Trevor when he suddenly stabs her. Amy wakes up in her bed alone. Amy sees a light on in the tower and finds Vanessa who says that she got Amy's note to meet with her there. Amy replies that she didn't send her any note when a dummy falls onto a table and the two girls run up to the tower followed by the killer. They hide in a room when the door is opened and the killer grabs Vanessa, but leaves Amy locked in the room. Amy breaks down the door and finds a dead Vanessa hanging from the tower bell. Amy runs outside where Reese sees her and begins to follow her. Amy finds Trevor who takes her to the library. He tells her that in his own investigation, all the dead people worked on the short film The Gods of Men, his brother's film. They watch the bad film when at the end of it, Amy notices a splice and says that it is not Travis' film. Amy and Trevor waylay Toby Melcher as he is driving to the campus by flaging him down and threaten him with a gun as another urban legend (a guy picking up a dead hitchhiker). They take him to the studio set and handcuff him to a chair and accuse him of being the killer for he is the only surviving crew member who worked on Travis' film. Just then, Professor Solomon arrives where Trevor, acting as Travis, says that Toby stole his film. Toby reminds 'Travis' that Travis only did the sound and merely gave the credit to Toby who has never seen the film. Suddenly, Solomon pulls out a gun and shoots Toby. Trevor goes for the gun and Amy runs. Solomon knocks Trevor aside and holds him at gunpoint. The professor tells Amy that many years ago, her father was one of the judges who cast the deciding vote against him for the Hitchcock Award in film school. Solomon explains what when Amy came into his office on that day with her idea about making a horror movie about an urban legend serial killer, he decided to kill all those who worked on Travis' film and frame her for the killings so he could steal Travis' film and submit it as his own. Graham comes out of hiding and swings a chair at Solomon who ducks and the four of them battle over the gun until Reese arrives and points her gun at all of them unsure who is the killer. Feigning innocence, Solomon reminds Reese that Amy is the killer because he saw her running from the tower a few hours ago when Vanessa was killed. Reese points her gun at the professor saying that she never told anyone that she even saw Amy running from the tower and the only way that Solomon knows is if he was there. Solomon punches Reese and she punches him back. During the struggle, the prop guns get mixed up with the real guns. Amy, Trevor, and Solomon each have a gun. Trevor and Solomon get a click, but nothing happens. Amy, with a gold-trimmed gun that Reese had shown her earlier, tries to pass the gun to Reese. Solomon jumps on her and gets shot in the back. Reese then places him under arrest as Amy and Trevor embrace. Graham also finds Toby whom is still alive as well. Some months later, Trevor is accepting the Alfred Hitchcock Award on behalf of his late brother's film when the creepy PA Kevin, perched high atop a walkway, attempts to shoot Trevor as he is accepting the award and gets shot by Reese. Kevin falls off the scaffolding.... into a large air bag below and Amy yells \"Cut!\" It is the last scene of Amy's very first independent funded movie titled Urban Legends with her directing, Trevor in the lead role, Toby as the assistant director, and most of the crew in acting parts, while Graham talks on his cell phone nearby as Amy's manager to discuss her film's upcoming completion and future premier. In the final scene set another few months later, a TV set showing Amy's complete film is turned off by a nurse while a dazed and near-cationic Solomon, now confined to a wheelchair from his gunshot wound, is now residing in a insane asylum having watched Amy's completed movie. Solomon is wheeled away back to his room by a familiar looking nurse whom is.... Brenda Bates (Rebecca Gayheart). The wild-eyed killer from the first Urban Legend movie and the inspiration for this whole new film.",

         "\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is a sequel to the 1998 slasher movie \"Urban Legend\". The sequel concerns a group of college coeds, primarily lead by aspiring film director Amy Mayfield. Amy is trying to direct a horror film for her latest project, and is striving to be awarded the Hitchock Award from her school. She introduces the idea of a horror film based on urban legends, but after the crew of filmmakers begin to shoot their project, cast and crew members begin to disappear one by one. The more of the film that is shot, the more students begin to die. Who is responsible for the killing? Could it be Travis' twin brother Trevor? Or could it be someone else? Who knows? Who cares? The original \"Urban Legend\" wasn't Oscar worthy but it had a semi-original story, some horror clichés tossed in. But for the most part, it was a decent slasher film. This follow-up is nowhere near the first film. The story was somewhat weak, and it was as clichéd as could be - bumps in the dark, eerie shadows, a misrepresenting interlude, and a killer who can appear out of thin air. The ending wasn't as shocking as the filmmakers were expecting it to be, and the little sequence before the credits roll tied this film to the original, but for what purpose? Reese, the female campus security cop from the original, returns in this film as the a new security guard on this campus, and does give a few laughs with her \"Foxy Brown\" imitations. The Amy character, our leading woman, does make some smart moves in the film, but all of the others make dumb decisions that cost them their lives. The scene that stood out the most of the whole film was the infamous \"kidney\" scene, which was actually pretty well constructed and was disgusting enough. Overall, \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" isn't anything great. The story wasn't anything we haven't seen before, it's your basic \"find out who the killer is\" horror movie. It serves well as a gory slasher flick, but there is nothing new that it has to offer and very little surprises at all. Put all that aside, fans of the first movie may want to check this out. But, while the original wasn't great, I can confidently say it was better than the sequel. 5/10.",
         "Where to start? It is hard to describe how bad this sequel is. The original Urban Legends was okay- not great, just entertaining. But Urban Legends: Final Cut is just plain stupid. I don't want to spoil it for you, but only the first killing is related to a famous and spooky urban legend. Other killings are very unoriginal and lame (killing with knife, electricity and so on). There are many suspects, everyone has their own reason for killing. Or at least they all look suspicious. BUT the true killer is shown only a few minutes in the movie- he is a mad professor with idiotic reasons for killing. Now when I think about it, the whole story can be filmed in 5 minutes. The characters aren't related and the events aren't related. A girl shoots a movie, her friends are killed, a twin brother shows up and the killer is beated. This movie made me very angry. Angry, because I just can't imagine how the directors of this crap even managed to get their job.",
         "I have to ask myself why did I even rent this... an ex-girlfriend recommended it so maybe it was all some sort of revenge... Actually I really liked scream 3 so I was a bit hopeful in watching this but my hopes were mangled much like a fragile monarch butterfly caught in a lawnmower. The story was just horrible; it made no sense just a stream of unconnected gore scenes that don't build tension or suspense. The Characters aren't even amusing stereotypes, and not that the actors had much to work with in the first place. The central problem with movies like this...without good characters the movie drags, the gore scenes become meaningless and we don't care who lives and who dies. The stolen kidney death scene was nice and brutal, and the campus where it was filmed was really cool, that's about it on the good points.",
         "(spoilers) In a time when teenage slasher mystery thrillers are in tremendous overabundance, the sequel to the fairly entertaining Urban Legend is fortunately not a complete failure. I watched Urban Legends: Final Cut with very low expectations, which were the result of having heard that the movie was terrible, as well as my growing belief that a quality film in this genre, especially a sequel, will probably never be created again. The magic of the movies can only go so far. However, I was surprised to find that this particular sequel did have its redeeming values, despite the fact that it has the same old Scooby Doo ending, with the killer finally revealing himself and basically saying that he would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for those pesky kids. The film starts off on the set of a cheesy movie, which seems to take place during a drunken college party on an AIRPLANE (hence, `cheesy' movie). Luckily, this is revealed to be a movie within a movie, so it didn't really take away from the film as a whole, but Urban Legends: Final Cut definitely had its share of stupidity. The security guard, for example, who we remember from the first film, sure didn't seem to have learned anything from her past experiences. Not only do we find her dancing to Pam Grier films while HORROR movies are being made (the perfect setting for a murder to take place) but she also does she not believe the girl when she tells her that she saw a murder. And don't even get me started on the killer. Until the killer is revealed at the end, he is exactly the same as the now-boring killers in countless other rip-off films \u0096 everything from I Know What You Did Last Summer and I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago to all of the Scream films, all of which `borrowed' this idea from John Carpenter's horror classic, Halloween. Seeing how Halloween was released about 23 years ago and has been ripped off in record numbers, I think that it's about time to come up with some different kind of villain. 007 movies always have these cool bad guys, but the teen thriller genre always recycles the now boring \u0091guy in the mask' routine. I didn't hate Urban Legends: Final Cut because there really were a few scenes in the film that actually worked. For example, the scene when all of the students were watching the rushes and they saw the blonde girl's murder was actually pretty effective, in my opinion. Also, the scene with the bathtub full of ice worked pretty well, despite its lack of originality. But despite the unoriginal bathtub, the removed kidney was also pretty good, and this even evokes a painful reaction from the audience as the killer yanks her back in through the window by grabbing onto the freshly sewn wound through which the kidney was removed. OUCH. There was a lot of cheesy stuff in this movie, besides the tired inclusion of the mysterious killer. Much of the garbage is dumbly thrown into the dialogue in a number of wildly idiotic and clichéd lines \u0096 `This is my baby, baby.' `I won't let anything happen to you. I'll be there.' But the story was actually pretty good, at least some of it was. The twin brother for example, keeps the audience guessing more than the killer does, because by this point, anything else will command more interest than the old who's-the-killer mystery. It turns out that he was telling the truth, but for much of the film after his introduction, it is never really certain whether the twin was really a twin, or if he was the same guy, in which case he would probably be the killer. The end of the film is punctuated by a very welcome cameo from Rebecca Gayheart, who should have played a substantial role in this film, given the way that the original film ended. This obviously wasn't done because everyone would know right away who the killer was, but there seems to be a rough transition between the two films because of this. All in all, Urban Legends: Final Cut is worth the time, but it is still not as good as the original, which was also not even that great. But don't be put off by low expectations, it's not THAT bad.",
         "It's been awhile since I have seen a truly horrible movie, well, there was Mission To Mars, but that doesn't even compare to Urban Legends: Final Cut! I love watching horror movies, but I knew this wasn't going to be a \"horror\" movie, but rather a \"slasher flick\", and there is a difference between the two. I saw the trailers and TV spots for the film and they looked decent, so I decided to pay the 6 bucks and watch it, well actually 12 since my girlfriend was with me. While watching the movie, I was wondering if it was 8:00 p.m. in a movie theater watching a slasher flick, or if it was Noon in my house watching a Soap Opera...The premise of the one guy getting his head blown off and his twin brother comes back secretly......come on, these screenwriters are not even trying!!! Why not show the guy get his head blown off? Why the twin brother? Why make a sequel? Why even call it Urban Legends?! I have to admit, watching the girl in the bath tub full of ice was a good \"Urban Legend killing\", but then afterwards all of the killings have NOTHING to do with urban legends. Did they decide to have the sequel with the characters just making a movie ABOUT urban legends, but not have the actual movie about urban legends? I would have rather watched the movie that the film student characters were making rather than Urban Legends: Final Cut! This is just another victim of sequels being rushed. And anyone who rates this over a 3 must not be watching very many movies.....Even my girlfriend, whose taste in movies are not wonderful, thought this movie was horrible!",
         "I liked the original \"Urban Legend\" and I liked this one to. It has some suspense, and pretty much does what it's supposed to do. Another thing that I liked about this was that it didn't bring back the killer from the first film. It showed some originality by setting a \"sequel\" in a different location and dealing with, mainly, a different cast. My rating for both \"Urban Legend\" and \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\": 8/10",
         "URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS Several film students at an isolated university campus are targeted by a serial killer who patterns his/her crimes after various urban legends. John Ottman's unnecessary sequel is a disastrous jumble of humor and horror which isn't nearly as funny or frightening as the filmmakers might have hoped, and the visual references to various classic movies (most notably the VERTIGO-inspired climax) seem entirely superfluous. Most of the murders are routine, except for a grisly decapitation inspired by a similar sequence in Dario Argento's INFERNO (1980), but the rest of the movie adheres strictly to formula, as a masked killer strives to frame weak-willed heroine Jennifer Morrison for a series of brutal crimes. Only two of the characters from the original URBAN LEGEND (1998) have been retained: Loretta Devine as the campus security guard whose aspirations toward COFFY-style bravery are finally realized during a climactic confrontation with the killer, when he/she makes the mistake of trying to punch her out (Devine retaliates with the best line of dialogue in the entire movie!), and Rebecca Gayheart in an unbilled cameo which should raise a smile amongst devotees of the original film. The supporting cast is handsome but interchangeable, including Matthew Davis (TIGERLAND) as Morrison's potential love interest, Jessica Cauffiel (VALENTINE) as a dizzy would-be actress whose final sequence resembles one of the more famous set-pieces from PEEPING TOM (1959), Eva Mendes (ONCE UPON A TIME IN Mexico) as a statuesque lesbian beauty whose fondness for Morrison lands her in a whole heap of trouble, and Hart Bochner (APARTMENT ZERO, SUPERGIRL) as an unlikely college professor. Production values are polished, but the movie amounts to little more than an uninspired rehash, and represents an inauspicious debut for former composer/editor Ottman (THE USUAL SUSPECTS). Also starring Joseph Lawrence, Anson Mount and Marco Hofschneider.",
         "\"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is a lot better than expected for being a sequel. **SPOILERS** Attempting to finish film school, Amy Mayfield, (Jennifer Morrison) decides to change her film to one about a serial killer killing his victims on urban legends. Getting the proper script completed, she gets fellow members Sandra Petruzzi, (Jessica Cauffiel) Stanley Washington, (Anthony Anderson) Dirk Reynolds, (Michael Bacall) Graham Manning, (Joseph Lawrence) Vanessa Valdeon, (Eva Mendes) and Schorm Jabuscko, (Marco Hofschneider) to help her film her movie and must immediately get through several pretty large production problems. Soon, she starts to realize that there's a serial killer running around loose behind the scenes killing off the crew, and must stop the madman before killing off everyone connecting to the film. The Good News: This here was a pretty surprising entry. One of the things it does well is that it makes a hard time of determining if what's being seen is real or just being shot for the movie. It plays the movie-within-a-movie trick to nice effect, since both are quite well-done and make it hard to distinguish from the other. It features enough to make it feel enjoyable, and the twists are really nice. There's several great ones to come from this trick, mainly it's wonderful opening sequence where a crazy couple are attacked on a rowdy plane during a severe thunderstorm, and upon coming out of the bathroom as the plane's shaking and wobbling, there's a big scene with a long chase, a rather great discovery-of-the-bodies sequence and a great fun conclusion, all to learn otherwise after the fact it's been faked. There's even more over the course of the film, and all of them are well-handled, and the non-trick ones come out rather nice as well. A sequence where the assembled cast watch the dailies, only for a strange sequence to air where one of the cast is viciously stalked and killed is screened, all but one thinking it to be a sequence shot for the film but the other positive that it's real and not staged. A murder done during the recording of a scream-test loud enough to drown out the victim's own is a great scene, leading to a thrilling chase through the recording studio and out into the surrounding countryside and pool make for some great viewing. The final confrontation in the movie sets graveyard setting is just fun, being creepy, exciting and all-around a blast. The mask worn in here is quite nice, with a simple ski mask worn over a big jacket, looking quite impressive in the few scenes it's used and hoping that more would've been nice. The last big feature here is a really nice and healthy mix amongst the kills in here. There's a decapitation here by shoving broken glass window onto their neck, slashed repeatedly with a razor, stabbing in several different areas with a knife, a gunshot and a beating with a camera lens, amongst others. These here are the film's rather good parts. The Bad News: This one here only has a few flaws to it. The main one here is that the main explanation for the killing. There's a lot of things that can go wrong for how to interpret it, and it feels just too clumsy and unrealistic to be considered as believable, and becomes laughable at a certain point. This here is really weak, and serves as the main flaw in this one. The fact that the violence is toned down from anything that it should have, since, for all the creativity displayed in the kills, it isn't very bloody and with a couple of kills that could've been in here. These are the same thing that really should've fixed by taking more of those and making them more bloody. It would've taken out a mild flaw in the film rather simply. The last flaw in here is the film's maddening ability to switch between the film shoot and the real world. It's fun at times, but there's also the fact that the film tries to be clever with changing around the two and it gets a little harder to defend the longer they go on. These here are the film's flaws. The Final Verdict: A lot better than expected, with just a few mild flaws that don't quite make this one as bad as it's been perceived. Give it a chance if you enjoy slashers or the general state of the slashers from that time-period or even just curious and open-minded, while all others should heed caution with it.

No matter how bad they are I usually enjoy them all even \"Halloween: Resurrection\" was quite entertaining in my book, although not needed one bit! \"Urban Legends\" was another slasher I enjoyed and although I know it's nothing special, it's certainly no \"Scream\", \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" tries to enter the \"Scream\" franchise but just simply doesn't have the same balls \"Scream\" has. Nevertheless it was entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable! It starts out a little bit like Wes Craven's \"New Nightmare\" being set on a film set, (also like \"Scream 3\"). If you have seen \"Urban Legends\" then you basically have seen \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" because it's more of the same stalk and slash, only this time not all the kills are off-screen! (That really annoyed me in the first one!) It follows the same formula on the set of a top film college. Everyones trying to win the \"Hitcock prize\" by making low-budget crap and a Kirsten Dunst look-a-like (the real one was too expensive) is going to make a film about a killer basing his murders on urban legends (de ja vu!) Only the film comes to life and someone is killing off her crew. That's the basic plot, it's simple and everyone can follow it. This is the type of film girls would watch after \"Twilight\" on a sleepover thinking its a really adult, extreme horror film after being mildly scared by \"Twilight\". That means that for the rest of us, the scares are minimal and the action is just enjoyable instead of heart-stopping! However, what I did like was the way it used humour. It was really funny in some places and the black security guard was a hoot baby! So you can't say that this film wasn't fun. What was also fantastic was the ending! I thought I was being very clever in sussing out who the killer was but it took me completely by surprise! \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" is a wannabee \"Scream\" for a more miniature audience (i.e. 12+) it tries to be clever and sometimes it is but it is fun throughout and never dull. Just don't expect an out-of-this-world slasher because you simply aren't going to get it. If you're not expecting much then give it a try. I really enjoyed it.",
         "I don't understand how people think this was bad! Sure, number one was better, but this one wasn't terrible! Sure, an urban legends movie about making an urban legends movie is a little weird, but I enjoyed it to a certain amount. And you have to love the opening scene! Its Tara Reid all over again. I had to watch her die again and again! But if you don't like number two, make sure you've seen number one first. It's much better. And if you want to make fun of Urban Legends, make fun of number three. The numbers really do indicate how good or bad they are, 1 being the best. 7/10. Not terrible."
