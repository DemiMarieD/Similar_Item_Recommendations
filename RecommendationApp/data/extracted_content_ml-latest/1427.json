         "Here's one of those films that wears you out. By the end, you're exhausted. I really liked this the first two times but three viewings were enough. By then, the absurdity of the whole thing had fried what few brain cells I have left. Ray Liotta is excellent as the psycho serial killer who puts on a charming Ted Bundy-like appearance for a short while before publicly showing his insanity. He's fascinating, start to finish here, even providing some very humorous lines. I wish I could say I enjoyed the other people in here but, except for Ben Cross, I couldn't. Lauren Holly, the female star of the film, is decent for much of the \"ride\" but becomes annoying and totally non-believable in the final phase of the film, becoming out-of-character profane and nasty herself. (Of course, her flight did turn out to be a tiny bit stressful which might have affected her patience. ha ha) Of course, with a film like this, there are going to be some severe questions with credibility, but when did that ever stop filmmakers? Other reviewers in here have already detailed some of the non--sensible parts, so no need to dwell on that. This is not brainfood: it's just escapist entertainment for a night, something to show your girlfriend so she'll hold onto you during all the suspense! Anyway, I enjoyed the special effects, especially with the plane smashing a few buildings, and the sound was awesome, at least on the DVD. For much of the flight, they are flying through a storm and the rumbles form the shaking airliner, was dramatic.",
         "Many people are very critical of this movie-but it does have some fans,including me!Okay,the whole thing is full of absurdities-but so what!Butler takes the old \"stewardess flies the plane\" cliche,runs with it,and delivers an enormously entertaining slice of hokum.The formula is paired down to basics,as mad serial killer Weaver(Ray Liotta),creates havoc aboard the plane,determined it will crash into L.A.-so he can go out in a blaze of vengeful glory.All that stands in his way is plucky flight attendant Teri(Lauren Holly).The stage is set for a frantic live action \"Tom and Jerry\" wing ding between monstrous male psycho predator,and winsome female \"prey\". Liotta really seems to be enjoying himself here,and is given lots of goofy \"psycho speak\" to deliver with relish.Weaver has a sense of humor too!\"I'm never flying this airline again!\",he shouts to himself,after being tumbled backwards down some stairs,a leg painfully crushed in a door. Then there's Terri-cute,willowy and Bambi eyed-I found myself pretty upset seeing what poor Teri goes through in this movie!But despite insults,threats,punches,assaults,smoke attacks and all,she has the moxie to keep going.Battered,bruised and bloodied she still looks stunning!And at the beginning,we are told some guy just broke off his engagement to THIS girl!HE must've been crazier than Weaver!",
         "There's a bizarre human appetite for that which is awful. From lookie-looing at traffic accidents to Man Show mooks to Lettreman's stupid pet tricks to worst home videos, etc., people like to watch people being stupid, outrageous, and ridiculous. Therein lies the appeal of \"Turbulence\", a not-to-be-taken-seriously white knuckle ride into the realm of the ridiculous with Holly as the \"Stew\" who's got to save a 747 jumbo jet with a handful of passengers against all odds including one very whacked out serial killer (Liotta). Ok, ok...this movie is stupid. However, for those who can get to that place in their heads where they don't intellectualize, just go with it, and enjoy the humor-tinged hair raising suspense and silliness, 100 minutes of entertainment awaits. (C)",
         "An implausible but intense thrill ride with a more than competent cast. As the film opens, it is Christmas Eve, and we get our introduction to our Bad Guy, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta, doing the kind of character he does best). He's a good-looking, charming-on-the-surface killer who has come to be known as the \"Lonely Hearts Strangler\" because his M.O. is apparently to target a single woman, romance her for a time, and then . . . well, they do call him \"Strangler\". After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend (next intended victim's) place, he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective (Hector Elizondo) who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence (although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him?) In a clever bit of opening misdirection, we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine (waifish but not anorexic, blonde-haired-big-blue-eyed Lauren Holly) in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new \"girlfriend\", when in fact she is not. The two do meet, however, since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con (Brendan Gleeson, in a Glee-ful performance) who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question, \"What would you like?\", referring to drinks. His response? \"I'd like to nail you, baby,\", in the slimiest-sounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway, our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom, uses the soap-thingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him, and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BAD-ASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head, and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy, who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dust-up, the other con and several others are shot. (The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed). Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers \"No\". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few \"weapons\" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on. (Why, under these circumstances, does our psycho-but-sharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him, even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie, children!) Anyway, after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him, our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psycho-killer-chiller, and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas, this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.",
         "- 3/5 STARS - It's Airport 1975 meets Friday the 13th in this thriller at 35,000 feet. Set aboard the ultra-sophisticated Boeing 747-200, a serial killer and flight attendant battle for control of the airplane as both his mental condition and the plane's altitude deteriorate. A group of U.S. marshals is escorting two convicts aboard a nearly empty 747 on Christmas Eve. One convict escapes and kills all of the guards, along with the pilot. (The copilot is taken out just as efficiently by failing to observe the fasten seat belt sign!) After sitting back and letting them kill each other, serial killer Ryan Weaver (Liotta) fills the power vacuum and systematically secures control of the airplane. He has no intention of mounting an escape, however. Because he was already en route to death row, he plans to slowly torture his group of holiday captives while the plane flies itself into the ground. Flight Attendant Teri Halloran (Holly) will have none of that, and we find ourselves with a far more capable flight attendant than Karen Black (from Airport 1975) at the helm of this 747. A lot can change in 22 years, and this time our flight attendant is strong-willed, empowered, and ready to brandish a gun, if necessary, to defend her safe passage to the ground. But just as significantly, it's the technology that has changed in two decades. The airplane, the set design, and the special effects steal the show. Airplane buffs will be wowed at the display of real-world commercial jet technology, including the autoland system, which effectively replaces Charlton Heston (from Airport 1975) as the emergency pilot-in-command. Most of these whiz-bang gizmos are already present and functioning aboard commercial jets worldwide. By choosing such a high-tech plane, the producers were able to simplify the plot and omit the flight engineer altogether. He's been replaced by a bank of computers, as is becoming standard practice among domestic carriers. The reality factor does have to be put on hold rather often, such as when the 747 flips over and our stars are forced to struggle on the ceiling of the cabin. Or when the plane's landing gear becomes entangled in a rooftop restaurant and subsequently scoops up a parked car. The 747-200's autopilot isn't nearly smart enough to recover from either crisis, but it's easy to let the disbelief slide because the visuals are so startlingly fresh. External shots of the plane are well lit and light-years beyond what we have seen in any other aviation disaster film. Inside the plane, the sets are vibrant and alive with color. Brilliantly lit instrument panels, along with a talkative computer warning system, keep the audience involved. Even the avionics bay is bright and downright inviting! It's a good thing the director let the art designers run amuck, because the psychosis of our serial killer would've sunk the picture otherwise. This character should have been penned as a standard mental case, but instead he's a serial killer and a sex fiend, which makes for a variety of uncomfortable confrontations between himself and the flight attendants. Women generally do NOT like this movie, primarily because the sexually-charged power struggles are repulsive to a modern temperament. The audience is officially fed up when Teri strips to seduce Ryan, just so that she can hit him in the head. Of course, he regains the upper hand moments later. If just five minutes of this rubbish had been cut out the film, the result would have been much more satisfying. Liotta demonstrates his rendition of the crazed lunatic very well, and is highly entertaining until the script leads him to overly indulgent pastures. But ultimately, Turbulence is reluctant to decide whether it wants to be an action thriller or a teenage slasher movie. Although it eventually makes the right decision, half the movie has already passed by that point and those who would have abandoned ship, have already hit rewind. Compared to Airport 1975, Turbulence is at once both a much bigger and a much smaller film. Turbulence has an abundance of top-notch special effects and is a colorful visual assault. Yet, the simple story of a frightened stewardess, struggling to fly a jumbo jet, is lost in this psychotic game of cat-and-mouse. In the world of the seven minute attention span, Turbulence plays by the new rules and thus belays its weakness: it is too youthful to know that by simply sitting back and letting the suspense build, the end result can be so much more satisfying.",
         "Contains Spoilers!! Was this a comedy??????? Because I was laughing out loud at many points during this 'film'. My laughs hit a peek when Lauren Holly, a.k.a. 'Terri the Flight Attendant', smashes down the cockpit door trampling the serial killer Ray Liotta, who was carrying an axe. Terri goes from being a meek scared little stewardess (yes, I called her a stewardess), into Trans Continental Ripley from Aliens. They don't make movies worse than this. The fact that 41 people to date have given this movie a 10 show there are at least 41 people who have yet to be treated for their mental illness. I cannot BELIEVE the IMDb staff averaged this out at a 6.9. You people need help too. Parts that were laugh out loud hilarious include: 1. The fact that though it is Christmas Eve, the plane is virtually empty of passengers. All of us who travel during the Holidays can vouch for how empty planes are. Didn't the director ever see PLANES, TRAINS and AUTOMOBILES, or even HOME ALONE? 2. Ray Liotta taking time out during the F-6 storm to use the air phone to call the detective (Hector Elizondo) that arrested him to say he will be crashing the plane into LAX. 3. The 747 flying UPSIDE DOWN for NO reason (I have a hard time believing it would not crash). POSEIDON ADVENTURE meets AIRPORT 75. 4. The plane clips a restaurant/bar with the terribly clichÃ©d Japanese tourists butchering karaoke Christmas songs. 5. Ray Liotta singing Christmas songs while he runs aimlessly through the plane, his favorite being 'Buffalo Gal Won't You Come Out Tonight'. 6. Liotta's air phone popping up again in the circuitry section of the airplane, so that he can call Elizondo AGAIN, just to let him know he's going to disable the autopilot. 7. The F-16 fighter pilot, who surely will receive a court martial, disobeying repeated direct orders to shoot down the 747. 8. The fact that they put the F-16 pilot in the air to shoot down the 747 over the dessert to avoid civilian casulaties, yet they wait until the plane ALREADY passes over LAX to order him to shoot it down. 9. The F16 pilot instead shoots the Ford Explorer off of the 747's landing gear (yes-that' right, the plane picked up this unwanted luggage when it sheared the top off of the parking garage - again failing to crash). 10. The Ford Explorer not exploding during the first abortive attempt to land the 747 when it was dragged at 400+ mph along the runway. 11. The 747 crashes through a billboard and still flies. 12. The autopilot controls conveniently surviving the ax attack by Liotta. 13. The British accented airline captain who walks Terri through the 'landing' (also, he's not in the flight tower, but sitting in his plane on the runway). 14. The fact that Hector Elizondo appears at the plane seconds after it lands standing under an umbrella, despite the fact we just saw him in the Air Control Tower seconds earlier. 15. The fact that the before mentioned British Captain is the only one there to greet Terri as she leaves the plane, and they waltz away under an umbrella together. By the way, has anyone ever traveled in a plane packed with Christmas decorations??????????? This film makes DIE HARD 2 look like a documentary. If you're in the mood for a good laugh, don't watch Airplane again for the 20th time. Instead check this film out. It is likely to be in the Adventure section of your local video store, but it should be relocated to the Comedy section.",
         "on the evening of the 20th June 2004 I had the choice of watching either Ray Liotta in GOODFELLAS or Ray Liotta in TURBULENCE . To be honest it wasn`t really a choice since I`d already reviewed GOODFELLAS and I hadn`t got round to seeing TURBULENCE so decided to watch the movie I hadn`t seen !!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!! As soon as the credits started I`d worked out how this movie was going to play out . Don`t ask me how but I`d got it into my head that this was going to be very similar to CON AIR with a serial killer taking over a jumbo jet with Ray Liotta`s character Ryan Weaver saving the day . In this respect my prediction was half right with a psychotic nutcase taking over a jumbo jet but it`s Weaver who`s the serial killer . I guess the producers can claim this is a shocking plot twist but for some strange reason it doesn`t feel convincing in anyway , in fact it feels downright ridiculous . Judging by the comments on this page it seems that many people like myself feel cheated as to how the story progresses , here we were expecting the doe eyed Weaver to risk life and limb to over come evil scumbags ( And getting a pardon from the President after the feds finally track down the real serial killer ) only to find Weaver`s the main scumbag I don`t know if it`s down to the script but Liotta doesn`t make a convincing bad guy . No hold on , the more I think about it the more I believe Liotta should start taking more and more of the blame for this fiasco . It`s difficult to tell how his career might have panned out if he`d been given roles as good guys but Liotta has always seemed miscast as a violent killer and TURBULENCE proves it . Just so Stevie Wonder and all the blind people in the audience can get the point Liotta goes so over the top that he`s in danger of going into orbit - into orbit around the planet Jupiter by my reckoning , there`s no subtlety at all to Weaver and would have probably brought the film down if it wasn`t for the fact that there wasn`t much of a film to begin with Note to Hollywood producers - Try casting Ray Liotta as a good guy . Considering he`s appeared in so many turkeys since GOODFELLAS I`m sure he`d be very cheap to employ",
         "Disgusting. That sums up the train-wreck-in-the-sky entitled \"Turbulence\". The DVD should come with its' own air-sick bag, because you'll be nauseaous from the time it lifts off the runway. A thin story is anchored even more by horrible, and I mean horrible acting from both Ray Liotta and Lauren Holly. This is yet another Ray Liotta psychopath flick. When is he not type-cast as a thug or maniac? Very predictable lines from him. Lauren Holly looked like a genius - in Dumb and Dumber. \"Turbulence\" highlights the lowest point in her acting career. From horrible make-up, to times in the movie where she goes from calm (when she shouldn't be) to a screaming mess defending herself from Liotta's killer habits. Luckily, a friend lent me this DVD, so I didn't actually waste any money on it, but I did waste an hour and 37 minutes. This is no Airport '75 - not by a long shot.",
         "*******************Contains Spoilers******************************** Well, the whole movie is pretty unbelievable. After all that had happened previously (the plane was hijacked by criminals, the flight crew were murdered, one of the criminals turned into a crazy murderer, the cabin depresurised, the killer hacked out the auto pilot with an axe, the stewardess lost her blouse fighting a fire, the plane flew into a full strength storm) the plane crashed into the top of several LA buildings without receiving any damage, apart from getting a Ford Explorer attached to one of the wheels! There were some plain ridiculous moments - like when the stewardess believed the crazy fool murderer (Ray Liota) over the advice of the Air Traffic Control Tower. It was also fairly ridiculous when the attached Ford Explorer was removed by a USAF pilot who disobeyed the order from the nasty FBI guy to shoot down the 747. Anyway despite more complications than your average transatlantic flight, it landed safely. There was even a hint of romance at the end when the blouseless stewardess met the British pilot who tutored her down onto terra firma... Still, it was the best thing on at midnight and it's a darn sight better than the Matrix reloaded! Enjoyable, unbelievable, watch if it's on, if not, don't worry about renting it. 6/10",
         "I guess September 11th of 2001 has eaten lots away from the entertainment value of movies like \"Passenger 57\" or \"Turbulence\" but let's face it, this one was never a masterpiece to start with. The biggest reason to watch \"Turbulence\" is Ray Liotta's excellent, furious performance as a psychopathic killer Ryan Weaver. Without him the film would hardly be even half as good. There's very little of decent special effects and the plot is incredibly basic, providing not even a single surprise or a twist. In a nutshell, this is just one watchable plane flick if you really haven't got anything better to do and certainly more interesting than just an empty television screen."

         "Ryan Weaver romances beautiful women before he kills them. Ryan is arrested, convicted, and is part of a Christmas Eve transfer of prisoners on a transcontinental 747 commercial flight. Other airlines at JFK may have holiday passengers waiting on stand-by, but this jumbo jet takes off with a lot of empty seats. Ryan and another prisoner overpower and kill their guards. The few civilian passengers are herded into a \"pantry\" on the plane and are not seen again until the end of the movie. Ryan eliminates the other prisoners and all the crew members except Teri Halloran. The remainder of the movie follows a \"cat-and-mouse\" game between Ryan and Teri on the 747.",
         "Ryan Weaver is a serial killer who is known as the Lonely Hearts Strangler. Ryan was raised by his aunt, who disappeared 19 years ago when Ryan was 16-years-old. Two years ago, Ryan was convicted of raping and killing 5 women in the Los Angeles area, and Ryan was sentenced to be executed, but on his way to the prison, Ryan escaped. For the two years since the escape, Los Angeles cop Aldo Hines has been after Ryan. In New York City, Aldo finally finds Ryan, and Ryan is prepared to be extradited to Los Angeles. Two days later, on Christmas Eve, TransCon Airlines flight 7 takes off with four U.S. Marshals on the airplane guarding Ryan and another convict named Stubbs. While the airplane is over Akron, Ohio, Stubbs kills all four of the marshals. Ryan then grabs a gun and kills Stubbs. During this melee, pilot Matt Powell and co-pilot Ted Kary are both killed, leaving the autopilot to fly the airplane, and Ryan takes the airplane hostage. Flight attendant Teri Halloran rushes to the cockpit, where she radios the nearest control tower and is patched through to Tower Airlines pilot Samuel Bowen, who tries to help her as Ryan repeatedly tries to kill her.",
