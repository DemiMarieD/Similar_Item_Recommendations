      "synopsis": "Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty) is a quarterback for the LA Rams, and has just been given a chance to start. He is an exercise fanatic, and while bicycling, he is hit by a car. He is plucked into a \"way station\" by his Escort (Buck Henry) by mistake. Joe refuses to go on to heaven, and by the time the Escort and Mr. Jordan (James Mason) realize this, his body has been cremated, and they cannot return him to his body. Mr. Jordan allows Joe to see several candidate bodies (just before they die), offering Joe a chance to inhabit their body. He finally selects the body of a murdered millionaire, Leo Farnsworth. It turns out the millionaire was murdered by his wife Julia (Dyan Cannon) and assistant Tony (Charles Grodin). He makes his decision after seeing Betty Logan (Julie Christie), a teacher who is petitioning on behalf of a small town. Joe realizes he can help Betty as Farnsworth. He tries to explain to Betty that he's Joe, but she doesn't buy it. Joe starts to assimilate into Farnsworth's life, but the lack of football is annoying. He's not very happy with the corporate cutthroat style, and amazes everyone with his new, more caring attitude. He uses football analogies to define his company's new direction, and people think he's crazy. Betty is impressed, and he takes her out to dinner - at a drive-thru. They fall in love, awkwardly. The Escort tells Joe they have another body, but Joe has decided to get Farnsworth's body in shape instead. He tells Julia he wants a divorce, and Julia and Tony continue to try and kill him. He contacts his old trainer Max (Jack Warden) to get him into shape. He manages to convince Max that he's Joe. They start an exercise program, and get the staff to participate. He buys the team and announces he wants to play QB. During a scrimmage, Tony drops comments designed to get the players angry at Joe. The defense keeps jumping offside and punishing Joe, but Joe perserveres and wins the players over. After the scrimmage, Joe hosts a party, and Julia and Tony see him wander off with Betty. He sees the Escort, who tells him he can't continue using Farnsworth's body. Joe tells Betty to remember him, and after she's gone, Tony shoots him. The body falls into a well and Joe and Mr. Jordan return to the way station. Meanwhile, the staff and police cannot find Farnsworth's body. During the investigation, Julia tries to pin the murder on Betty. During the Super Bowl, the Rams QB gets mortally, injured, and Joe takes over his body. Watching the game, Max realizes Joe is in a new body and Tony cracks, blaming Julia for the murder. Joe wins the Super Bowl with the Rams, then Mr. Jordan appears and tells Joe that he won't remember being Joe - he's Tom Jarrett, the Rams QB now. Max doesn't realize Joe is now Tom, but finally comes to grips with it. Betty comes to see Max and sees Joe/Tom in the hallway. They speak, and she sees glints of Joe in the new Tom. He invites her to have coffee, and they walk away together. The end.",

         "I too was surprised that this film received a not-much-better than average rating. I am not a huge fan of Beatty, but I think he plays his role in this movie perfectly, running rampant through the lives of his unfaithful wife and private secretary (Charles Grodin couldn't be better), and his former coach. Joe Pendleton is so sweet and earnest that he deserve a happy, fairy-tale ending. I don't think the script ever descends into sappiness and there is a fine ensemble cast. I laugh out loud still, even though I have seen the movie several times, and I still get a bit teary-eyed at the end. This film deserves better!",
         "I couldn't think of any other way to describe it in the summary - so I used the word \"classy\". That's right, classy. It probably stems from the fact that the movie is done in such good taste - very appealing and witty humor. The entire cast does an absolutely perfect job in this movie. From Warren Beatty, to James Mason (is James Mason physically capable of putting in a bad performance ? ), to Buck Henry, to Jack Warden. Perhaps the two best performances are Charles Grodin (the slimy personal assistant to Leo Farnsworth),and Dyan Cannon as the psycho Julia Farnsworth. They are both brilliant in their roles. Very worth watching. Also worth more than its IMDB 6.9 rating.",
         "I just about fell out of my chair when I saw that this film only got a 6.8. This is a light entertainment classic and Beatty has never been better suited for a role. The dream supporting cast includes Dyan Cannon, Jack Warden, James Mason, Buck Henry, Charles Grodin, Vincent Gardenia ... and all are at the top of their game. Julie Christie's character (as the love interest) seems, at first glance, to be a bit underwritten, but her scenes with Beatty linger in the memory - especially the ending where Beatty, in a new body with his memory wiped out, sees this beautiful woman in the bowels of a deserted football stadium and struggles to remember what she meant to him. Growing up, I seem to recall that CBS or some major network used to show this once every year and it was hyped as a big event (this was just before the explosion of cable). I never got tired of watching it each year and it still holds up remarkably well.",
         "6.9 is not a terrible score on here, but for a movie of this quality it is a shame. I very rarely have given a film a 9 and it is very unusual for me to give a higher than average score. This was my favorite movie when I was a kid and when I saw it again recently I was just as impressed as an adult. The cast was excellent and they managed to evoke much emotion out of a fairy tale like story. One of the few remakes worthy of discussion. I would consider this a must see for anyone who has any kind of feelings whatsoever.",
         "After appearing the rare Mike Nichols misstep THE FORTUNE (1975), it took Beatty three long years to return to the screen with the genteel comedy/fantasy HEAVEN CAN WAIT (1978). In addition to essaying the lead role, Beatty also made his debut in the director's chair, with the assistance of legendary comedy writer Buck Henry (who also plays a supporting role in the film). A remake of 1941 semi-classic HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, HEAVEN CAN WAIT may not surpass the delightful whimsy of the original classic, but it emerges as somewhat of a modern classic in it's own right. The film was an instant hit with both critics and audiences, was nominated for an astounding 9 Oscars including \"Best Picture,\" and remains a magical film that is almost impossible not to love. Beatty not only proves himself to be a perfectly competent film director, and the picture also provides the star with one of his best roles as an actor. Beatty's good-natured football player Joe is the exact type of lovable stud that you cannot help but fall for. The film's screenplay takes Joe from earth to heaven and to back to earth again through an assortment of various bodies, and Beatty's easygoing charisma holds it all together and keeps viewers involved in the story and fixated on the screen. This is a star performance if there ever was one, and Beatty has rarely been more likable. The rest of the cast is particularly winning. The still silver-tongued James Mason (in a part originally offered to the retired Cary Grant) as the heavenly Mr. Jordan and the endearing gruff Jack Warden are perfect as father figure-types for Beatty's Joe, and Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon are absolutely terrific as the film's pair of villains. The only performer missing the boat is a blah Julie Christie, who is pleasant but unconvincing in the sadly underwritten role of the ecologist love interest of the body Beatty has temporarily inherited. It seems as though the creators thought dressing Christie in frumpy wardrobe and frizzy hairstyle was enough to give the character depth, but all they succeeded in was making a natural beauty look rather hideous. The film is a joyous, comedic piece of whimsy that manages to incorporate slapstick comedy, romance, fantasy, and even an underdog sports story without ever feeling bloated or disjointed. The true emotional highpoint comes with Mr. Jordan's farewell to Joe, as well as Max failing to recognize him in his new body. The rather shallow development of Christie's character leaves the film's THE WAY WE WERE-like finale ringing a bit hollow, but it's still an effectively bittersweet coda nonetheless. This film launched a major revival of whimsical comedies that remained popular until the late-eighties, and it easily remains the best effort of this revival.",
         "I remember as a kid, I loved this movie. I had seen it in the theatre and liked it so much I saw it again! I think the appeal here is the same as in many of these types of films-it's a sweet whimsical fairytale of a movie that is pure entertainment but manages to be lovely without being corny at the same time. There aren't to many movies like this around now. Of coarse, not having seen this since I was a child who knows whether I'd still be such a fan but at that time, I wept buckets and since it was one of the first films that I saw that stuck with me, I have fond memories of it. People shouldn't put this movie down for realism or not having realism etc. It's a fantasy type movie. It's the type of movie you know your wtavhing a movie while you watch it but you cry anyway! I don't think this movie can be dismissed as being lightweight or unimportant. Where would film be without romance? This is up there in that category and many I know feel the same. It's a breath of fresh air and should be seen by anyone who likes warm sentimental (yeah OK sappy!!) movies!",
         "This film is entertaining. I like Warren in this film, and the script is crazy enough that it works. There is a message about hope in this film, and we all need hope. Some parts of the film can be so funny, I like how they end it. This film ties all the lose ends up nicely. I remember the 78 and 79 Rams those were pretty good teams. 7 or 8 out of ten.",
         "Enjoyable \"It's a Wonderful Life\"-styled remake of \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\", a memorable and sometimes forgotten production from 1941. An over-zealous angel (Buck Henry) takes the quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams (Oscar-nominee Warren Beatty) before his time. Naturally the body is cremated and Henry has to find Beatty another one. Beatty is then re-incarnated as a recently murdered billionaire. This development confuses the billionaire's two-timing wife (Oscar-nominee Dyan Cannon) and accountant (Charles Grodin, also Cannon's lover). Beatty promptly purchases his former team and makes himself the quarterback with aspirations of leading his club to the Super Bowl and winning it. Also along for the ride is the love interest (the always excellent Julie Christie) and the hard-nosed head trainer (priceless Oscar-nominee Jack Warden). \"Heaven Can Wait\" is a film that teaches about love, compassion, friendship and good moral values. Co-writer/co-director Beatty (nominated in both categories) is the primary catalyst here. His ability as a film-maker raises the movie to a near classic level. Admittedly the production never does quite reach the greatness of films of the type from the 1940s, but still ends up being one of the major winners from the 1970s. Co-star Henry shared a directing nomination with Beatty. Is it just me or do you miss having the Rams in Los Angeles? 4.5 out of 5 stars.",
         "Rent this movie with someone you love- it's the one that started it all. (Even thought it's a remake, itself) Buck Henry did a fabulous job with this film. He also wrote The Graduate, by the way, and there are gentle subversive moments in this film as well. I won't spoil them for you, just watch for yourself. Warren Beaty has never been so charming, and that's saying a lot, and Jack Warden just about walks away with the film. Forget GHOST, go right to HEAVEN CAN WAIT. You won't be sorry.",
         "Although made in the very late 1970's, \"Heaven Can Wait\" is really a throwback to a bygone era of fantasy film-making. Hollywood offerings such as \"The Bishop's Wife\" (where Carey Grant plays an angel), \"Angels in the Outfield\", \"It's a Wonderful Life\", and \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" (which is actually the inspiration behind \"Heaven Can Wait\") were innocent 100-minute escapist fair whose only mission was to entertain. Some modern offerings include \"Mr Destiny\", \"Maid to Order\", and the TV shows \"The Flying Nun\" and \"Touched by an Angel\". None of these kinds of films have much in the way of cutting social commentary or even ground-breaking cinematic techniques. However, their entertainment value is very high, being nothing but. \"Heaven Can Wait\" is this kind of a movie, maybe the perfect \"chick flick\" as it combines fantasy, football and even a little love story. The story is relatively simple: Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty), a quarterback in the twilight of his career, feels destined to make it to the Superbowl. The LA Rams, his team, are in the playoffs. One day during early-morning training after consuming his liver-and-whey shake, he bicycles into a tunnel where two large vehicles taking both lanes are charging from the other direction of the tunnel. Looks like Pendleton will be playing in a Superbowl coached by Vince Lombardi with George \"The Gipper\" Gipp as one of his teammates. The next thing he knows, he's jogging among clouds with an escort (played by writer-director Buck Henry who also played the hotel attendant in \"The Graduate\") in a suit and tie trying to get him to stop running around. Pendleton is still in his athletic clothes sporting a soprano saxophone and doing push-ups among the fluffy billows. He doesn't quite realize he's died. Or has he? Turns out the escort made a mistake: Pendleton would have survived, perhaps avoided, the collision, but the escort nabbed him from his body before the resolution of the event, relying on \"probability and outcome\", a recurring theme of the movie. Pendleton was not due for many decades. His case is taken up by Mr Jordan (James Mason in one of his later roles) a kind of heavenly supervisor who apparently coordinates peoples' souls. Realizing the mistake, Jordan takes Pendleton back to earth to find him a new body so he can live out the rest of his life as he was meant to. The only one available is the body of millionaire Leo Farnsworth who has just been murdered care of his estranged wife and personal assistant, played brilliantly by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin. One of the best scenes is when Pendleton reappears as Farnsworth, and Cannon nearly has a conniption. Pendleton, now as stuffy gazillionaire Farnsworth, must forge a way to get back to the Rams in time for the Superbowl. The aspect that saves this film from falling too far into sentimental gush or absolute unbelievability is the quality of the acting of the leads (particularly Warren Beatty, Charles Grodin, Dyan Cannon, Julie Christie, James Mason, and Jack Warden as Max, the Rams' trainer) coupled with a fine screenplay. Everything is believable. Certainly the whole concept is just about as far-fetched as the Land of Oz, but you never contemplate that possibility for a moment. For some reason, everything works, and you run with it, not unlike \"It's a Wonderful Life\". As silly and fantastical as it is, the trip is well worth it."

But he goes out one day and an accident occurs and the next thing he knows he is on his way to heaven. But he convinces the man in charge, Mr. Jordan, that he isn't suppose to be here and upon checking Mr. Jordan discovers that he is right and tries to get him back into his body but his body has been cremated. Mr. Jordan tells him that they can put him in another man's body provided that the man's death has not been discovered. Mr. Jordan now shows him the body of Leo Farnsworth, who has just been killed by his wife and secretary. Joe does not want to take Farnsworth's body until a woman, Betty Logan, who has a problem with what Farnsworth's business is doing to her home, insists on meeting him.
