      "synopsis": "In the beginning, we learn some more of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre's history. We learn that Sally Hardesty died of catatonia in 1977. We also learn that another family member that probably never appeared in the first one, W.E. Sawyer, of the cannibalistic clan was trialed and executed in 1981. During W.E.'s trial, the jury had came to the conclusion that since Leatherface was not taken into custody, they stated that it is unsure whether or not there is a Leatherface in reality. Now, taking place after the second movie, the year in the third installment is 1991. Chop Top didn't die at the end of Part 2 and is currently locked up in an asylum. Leatherface went off to live with some relatives along with Grandpa after the incident in 1987 as well. Leatherface continues along with his reign of terror as the killing machine he was before with the Sawyers keeping the Texas Chainsaw Massacre alive along with his relatives too. In the opening scenes, a young couple, Ryan and Michelle, are traveling from California to Florida in order to return a car they borrowed from a close relative, but \"there's roadkill all over Texas\". They are soon stopped near the interstate at a checkpoint due to an old cemetery desecration, which turned out to be a mass grave of 40-70 bodies just thrown into the one big hole. They are confronted by a Texas State Trooper who permits them to carry on but warns them not to stop on the road for anybody. After getting past the checkpoint, they stop at a service station owned by Alfredo Sawyer, a member of the cannibal family. After hitchhiking, Tex (a.k.a. Eddie Sawyer), stops at the service station as well, in time to give the kids some directions and to stop Alfredo from harassing Michelle who then gets in a fight with Tex saying that it's his place and he can do anything he wants to do there as he then grabs his shotgun and shoots Tex with it. As they leave the service station in a state of shock speeding away for dear life while they were shot at as well by Alfredo, Ryan tells Michelle that Tex gave him directions on where to go. Little did they know, it would lead them to Leatherface while another family member, Tinker Sawyer, tracks them down and knocks them off the road with his large 4-Wheel drive vehicle!!! Once knocked off the road by Tinker according to the family's plan, Ryan and Michelle change a tire that had popped during their get away, but run into Leatherface in the process. They manage to escape, but even more in a state of shock and panic. Due to their reactions towards the family, they end up running off the road again by Tex Sawyer who had found his way into the middle of the road they were getting onto and get hit by another car. The driver is a hunter and survialist by the name of Benny who recovers them from the scene of the crash and helps them. He tells them that his buddies were killed by the Sawyer family and he's out for revenge. After treating the couple, Benny heads on up the road back toward his truck finding Tinker who then tries to run him over. Benny jumps out of the way of Tinker's vehicle and falls down a hill nearby only to run into Leatherface. Benny fights off Leatherface and is saved by a young teenage girl who distracts Leatherface as Benny gets back on his knees. Leatherface ends up loosing the girl who goes back to be with Benny. The teen girl says that she was part of a group of people who were killed by the family as well. Benny comforts her and then goes back to where Ryan and Michelle were, since they weren't moving as much after the accident, but Ryan and Michelle had taken off from that place leaving the young girl alone and defenseless as she is killed by Leatherface due to how protected she was. Ryan is killed by Leatherface as he falls into a bear trap set up by the family telling Michelle to leave as Ryan is impaled by Leatherface's chainsaw. Michelle finds her way into a nearby house and finds a little girl who she follows to the girl's room. Once there, the girl shows Michelle her doll, Sally.... made out of the bones of a baby victim of the cannibal family!!!!! Michelle is all of a sudden grabbed by Tex who turns on the light in the girl's room revealing many human bones and remains as she is taken into the kitchen and nailed to a chair. Meanwhile, Benny, still outside in the woods, finds Alfredo who is disposing human remains in a nearby swamp and knocks him into it. Ryan's body is taken into the house and hanged on a machine built by Tinker, who is the real \"brains\" of the whole family when it comes to manufacturing. Mama Sawyer appears, who is a crippled old lady confided to a wheelchair and speaks through a voice box, and who cares for the deathly pale Grandpa Sawyer. (NOTICE: THIS NEXT SEQUENCE DESCRIBED IS DEPICTED IN ONLY THE UNRATED VERSION OF THE FILM! IF YOU DESIRE NOT TO READ THIS, SCROLL DOWN TO THE NEXT \"NOTICE\" I PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE TO AVOID READING THE FOLLOWING EVENT IN THE PLOT AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN IT IS OVER DUE TO THE NEXT \"NOTICE\" POSTED ALERTING YOU!) Later on, the little girl (a.k.a. Leatherface's daughter), kills Ryan off after he was hanging on the newly-improved meathook machine bleeding to death as the little girl pulls a lever that releases a sledgehammer, which whacks him in the face. (NOTICE: THIS IS THE END OF THE DESCRIPTION OF THE UNRATED SEQUENCE OF THE FILM!) Now almost supper time, Leatherface (whom the family refers to as 'Junior') tries out a new chainsaw given to him by Tex with \"the Saw is Family\" carved on the bar of the bright golden chainsaw on Michelle. Luckily, she survives as Benny arrives outside the kitchen window firing an automatic M-16 rifle at the house, killing Mama Sawyer, Grandpa Sawyer, and eventually Tinker Sawyer all present at the table ready to eat Michelle. Michelle frees herself runs out of the house being chased by Leatherface and looses him as Tex swings an axe at Benny releasing gas from Tinker's car as Benny ignites up his lighter and throws it on the ground as it hits the gasoline killing Tex who burns to death. Michelle ends up running back into Leatherface right when Benny hits Leatherface into a swamp saving Michelle. Leatherface ends up knocking out Benny as he falls to the bottom of the swamp. Leatherface then grabs onto Michelle dragging her into the swamp with her, but she hits him over the head with a rock knocking him out as well as he then sinks to the bottom too. Michelle runs and finds a truck that belonged to Alfredo as it opens up and Benny gets out of the car and comforts her, but all of a sudden Benny is knocked over by Alfredo who is still alive due to only being thrown into a swamp. Michelle jumps into the truck, finds a shotgun, and shoots Alfredo with it killing him finally. Benny gets off his feet and gets back in the truck with Michelle as they drive off into freedom, but as this happens, Leatherface, who is still alive as well as his daughter, watches Benny and Michelle as they drive away.",

         "Leatherface had the greatest trailer of all time (Leatherface meets the Lady of the Lake, remember that?). Maybe that's why nearly everyone was let down by the film itself. Most people view Leatherface as an unwelcome addition to the legacy that is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. No, it's not as good as the original or the sequel, but what do you expect when Tobe Hooper's not on board? However, if you do not compare it to its predecessors, it stands alone as a fun flick. It's at least watchable (unlike the Matthew McConaughey \"remake\"). The only thing I really don't like about it is the lack of continuity. The David Schow script is great, it just leaves out some needed information. In essence, this is the first in a long line of remakes. The director, Jeff Burr, does succeed in creating tension. My heart still pounds every time when they stop to fix that flat tire. Those far-off squeaking sounds are unnerving. The cast does well also. No one has the energy of Bill Moseley (Chop Top from TCM 2), but he's a tough act to follow. What they do have is horror favorite Ken Foree. Foree is always great. I don't care whether he's in Dawn of the Dead or The Phantom of the Mall, he's great. And you must give credit to Viggo Mortensen. He's come a long way from b horror to star in the Lord of the Rings. When it comes down to it, TCM 3 is worthy of a bit more praise.",
         "\"Leatherface:Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3\" is the nastiest installment of the series.There is plenty of violence,gore and ghoulish humour to satisfy many horror fans.The production design by Mick Strawn is simply striking and the acting is fairly convincing.The opening sequence,a grisly excavation of a mass grave in the woods,is unsettling enough to set a proper mood,but the ending is silly and disappointing.As for the characters Alfredo(Tom Everett)simply steals the show-in my opinion he is a variation on the first film's Hitchhiker character.And of course there is Leatherface(R.A.Mihailoff),who has a big shiny new saw.All in all if you liked the first two TCM movies give this one a look-I think that it's worth your time,just avoid \"The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"(1994)like the plague!",
         "\"Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3\" is the third installment in the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" series, and proves to be much, much better than the huge disappointment of the ridiculous Part 2. \"Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III\" is about a couple who are delivering a car to California, and are crossing Texas country. They stop at a gas station where a creepy set of brothers work, and they are back on the road again. When a tire goes out, they stop to try and fix it, but Leatherface emerges from the darkness with his trusty chainsaw. In a panic to save themselves, they speed off and end up later crashing into another man's car. After the accident, they are chased through the woods and taken to an old secluded farmhouse where more torture awaits. The family includes Viggo Mortensen, far before his \"Lord of the Rings\" fame, which is interesting to see him in his early movies. This movie doesn't skimp up on the gore, it is an all-out gorefest, much like \"Part II\" was, except I enjoyed this one a lot better. I rented it on DVD and watched the unrated version, and it was enough to make you think twice about eating anymore meat, it was pretty darn gory. Bottom line, this is one of the better sequels of the series, and a giant improvement from part 2. It had some suspenseful scenes that were well done and the acting wasn't bad. Overall, a well paced, well made sequel. 7/10.",
         "There are so many problems with Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III that I'm not sure where to begin, so I suppose I'll try to limit my comments to the characters. I couldn't have cared less whether the supposed heroes of the movie lived or died. A more unlikable pair do you rarely run across. The guy was a sniveling idiot and the girl had even less personality. \"Kill 'em and kill 'em quick\" was the thought running through my head. Second, we've got the characters that make up Leatherface's \"new\" family. Who are these people and where did they come from? I would have thought that the Texas Rangers would have completely investigated the Sawyer family and discovered any relative who may have taken in Leatherface after the events of the first two movies. And, are we supposed to believe that the entire extended family is also made up of inbred cannibal serial killers? With a family as large as the one presented in these movies you would think that (even if just by chance) at least one member of the family would have some reservations about hacking up innocent strangers. I almost get the feeling that the makers of Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III would have us believe that everyone in Texas is a nutty, chainsaw-welding maniac. Finally, there's Leatherface. I'll just say that he's a sad imitation of the original. And I know this has nothing to do with the character of Leatherface, but what's that engraved chainsaw all about? It's a completely ridiculous concept.",
         "Third Chainsaw film ignores the second film in the series & opens up with the cannibalistic chainsaw wielding maniac Leatherface now sporting leg brace, due to the horrible chainsaw cut he suffered at the end of the first movie & sporting a new look. His name is Junior, not Bubba like he was called in the first sequel & the third film in my opinion is better than the first sequel to the original 1974 horror film. Many may disagree, but I on the other hand found myself enjoying this one more, simply because it tried to take Leatherface back to his roots by making him big & scary & not some bozo who got shoved around like in the second which was really just a horror movie take on the THREE STOOGES & the film plays it straight, returning back to the dark, brooding vision original director Tobe Hooper had originally envisioned, amidst loads of black humour creating plenty of tension. My favourite moment is when Leatherface is working on an electronic device asking him what the image is before him, which shows a person, Leatherface spells food & the thing keeps telling him he's wrong, which soon starts to get under his skin. The film also features a dead armadillo on the side of the road, a crazy wanting to charge someone for taking their picture when they never asked him to. The snap shots of the corpses that have been found chopped up & desecrated, the fact that one of the family members worked at the slaughterhouse, hanging animal bones, the final \"Dinner\" scene with a captured heroine, the final chase between Leatherface & the heroine, the crazed hitchhiker who terrorizes the couple, all the things that occurred in the first.The family here is just as deadly, if not even more so, than the ones in the first film. These one lay out booby traps to catch their intended victims. In a way, this also hearkens back to the first in the sense that, in that film, original director Tobe Hooper had Leatherface butchering the characters as though they were human live stock, here Leatherface catches them in traps as if he & his family were hunters in search of food, only here the animals being caught are humans. The family also tends to be much cleaner than those of the first films family as well. There is no junk in the yard, they have power to their house (No generators used to keep the lights on here) they have an up to date stove & fridge, a clean kitchen & living room & they've even rigged up a contraption that causes a sledgehammer to release & smack their victims in the head. Another thing Chainsaw III does is answer the burning question many fans have had on their minds, why is it that the entire family is men? where did the women go? Here it implies that they maybe raping their female victims & then after the child is born & weaned, they kill them off, unless they share the same sadistic sensibilities as they do. Since Leatherface has an equally crazy little daughter, who has human bones littering her bedroom & plays with the bones of an small infant, using it as a doll. Borrowing an element or two from Chainsaw 2, the film features a blink & you'll miss her cameo appearance by CAROLINE WILLIAMS who plays a reporter near the beginning (She played the character of stretch in Chainsaw 2) the line uttered by Dreighton Sawyer \"The Saw Is Family\" is engraved in Leatherface's heavy duty chainsaw & of course the family keeps a long dead relative around (This time it's the grandfather character) even when it was just the R rated video cassette versions of the film that was available a few years back I still thought this was better than Part 2 (Don't get me wrong though I still loved the second film) New Line Cinema tried to make this come close to the original & in my eyes they created a good a sequel as they could at least as it regards to the original series. It returns the series back to the dark brooding tones & backwoods mayhem seen in the first. Obviously New Line, excited at the idea of owning a second horror character along with Freddy Kruger might bring them even more profits & decided to buy the rights back from Cannon Films. Unfortunately New Line's efforts to appease the MPAA caused their plan to blow up right in their face. Obviously not learning their lesson with the butchered A Nightmare On Elm Street 5: The Dream Child, New Line heavily cut the film & as a result, it not only flopped at the Box Office, but poor word of mouth, over a almost bloodless Texas Chainsaw film, killed off any chance of a possible revival of the Chainsaw series. The Chainsaw series yet again scores in the acting department, landing some really good talented actors for it's acting troupe. The actors here are able to make their characters even more interesting & the score by JIM MANZIE & PAT REGAN really helps ratchet up the tension & makes for a pretty cool horror movie soundtrack & R.A. MIHALIOFF stars as the hideous Leatherface & really makes the character a force to be reckoned with. Director Jeff Burr also does a great job creating tension through out the film & the acting is above par for this type of film, which features an early starring role by VIGGO MORTENSEN as one of the family members. Followed by Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation *** stars",
         "If you watch this as a remake and not a sequel, and then you'll understand it, because that is what it really was meant to be according to all involved as well as Tobe Hooper, who was on board for a while as an adviser. Otherwise, the storyline from TCM part 2 to this one won't make sense. I saw this when it was first released in the theater and didn't think too highly of it, but then I saw the uncut, unrated version recently and it improved more than 100%. It's spooky, atmospheric, relentlessly frightening, with a very good job by R A Mihailoff as Leatherface, whose brutal and monstrous characterization of Leatherface seems to be the basis for the current Leatherface character by Andrew Briniarski. There's no cowering to others in the family, transvestite behavior, or silly screaming as in other versions. Also this one has a great chainsaw, plenty of great character actors doing what they do best, as great characters. The film would have been better had the squeamish producers left in the X-rated violent scenes as they were originally. Would have been top notch if the (hideously deformed) Leatherface unmasking had remained, a bit that was eventually used to a degree in the 2003 version. Could have been a 10 had someone like Savini been involved. As it is, still superb.",
         "Well here we are in the land of chainsaw-wielding lunatics again folks! No longer in the hands of the original creators, this was a new leap for the series. Unfortunately by this point times had changed for horror films and the MPAA was cracking down on the violence in them. This film was target and suffered greatly. It ended up different from the vision of writer David Schow and director Jeff Burr and the closest we've ever gotten to what they intended to make is an Un-rated version. This isn't saying much though since this version is only slightly longer than the R-rated one. Does this mean the film is no good? Not at all. In fact, this second sequel is in some ways better than part 2 and so far is the best of the sequels. Pros: Nice work by the cast. Solid musical score, plus a cool Heavy Metal tune over the closing credits. Stunning photography. Briskly-paced. Some good chilling moments. Though closer in tone to the original, this film has some good twisted humor. Fair amount of blood and gore. Good job on the make-up and special effects. Nail-biting last few minutes. Cons: Brings nothing new to the table. Lacks the raw terror of the original. Not much plot. Unnecessary set-up for another sequel. Final thoughts: By the time this film came out the slasher genre had run out of steam, but this still managed to be a solid film and sequel. It's still no match for the original, but it's not a washout either. Despite the cuts and changes made, an above average horror film still shines through. My rating: 3.5/5",
         "At the end of Texas Chainsaw II, there was something of a variation on the ending of the original film. The girl who spends most of her time trying to escape the family of crazed maniacs with her life ends up holding the chainsaw herself, swinging it around like a lunatic exactly like Leatherface did at the end of the original film, which led me to believe that it would suggest a general direction that the movies would take in any further sequels. Instead, Texas Chainsaw III, one of the more controversial entries in the series, seems to be unaware of its predecessors. I hesitate to condemn the entire film just because it is seriously lacking in the quality department, if only because I watched the 'Making Of' featurettes on the DVD and found that the cast and crew actually went through some serious trouble getting the thing made, and the cause of a lot of the drops in quality was some things that they had to cut or change in order to get an R rather than X rating. You would think that all they have to do is cut out excessive blood or guts or nudity to tame the rating a bit, but they had to completely change scenes in order for the blasted MPAA to allow them to release it. Wes Craven went through similar troubles in some of his earlier films, like Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, and when you learn what they deal with it's not so hard to figure out why the MPAA is not popular with horror filmmakers. (spoilers)One thing that had to be changed, for example, was the ending. This is why you see a character show up grinning at the end of the film, despite the fact that we watched him get his head chainsawed in half earlier in the movie. Before you yank the DVD out of your DVD player and try to stick it in the wall, take a few minutes to watch the making of documentary, which essentially is 30 minutes of the cast and crew trying to explain why the movie was so bad. One verbose reviewer who calls himself Duke De Mondo writes a hilarious review in which he asserts that the Texas Chainsaw sequels all seem to pay homage to the original film as though it were some kind of urban legend, constantly reshuffling everything except Leatherface, the only character who is expected to be in any Texas Chainsaw movie. Hence, in part III, Leatherface is the only returning character, and as the director explains on the accompanying documentary, everyone else is some sort of surrogate family brought together my similar deviations from sanity. Still a pretty weak explanation for the little blonde girl, I should think. Speaking of which, it should be mentioned that at one point in the film, two people get chainsawed to death minutes apart, and it is not until I saw that little girl standing at the top of the stairs that I was even slightly apprehensive. What is it about little kids that makes them so scary? It's the worst when they are dressed in cute little outfits that just clash so strongly with their surroundings, like the little girl in this movie or, probably most famously, the twin girls in The Shining, who I still think are some of the creepiest kids ever captured on film. This girl turns out to be an aspiring member of the family, eager for her turn to put the meat hooks and sledge hammers to good use, and who decorates her room not with flowers or Barbie's or anything even remotely pink, but with human bones and skulls, presumably left over from the original Texas Chainsaw and, subsequently, The Hills Have Eyes. And this is to say nothing of her doll. You know, Jodie Foster had to undergo counseling in preparation for her role as a 12-year-old prostitute in Taxi Driver. I really wonder if there were similar concerns for this girl, whose film-making ordeal can't have been much less damaging. As far as the gore, Texas Chainsaw III is famous for being disappointing, but this is explained by the whole ratings fiasco. On the other hand, there was much talk about death scene of the girl who had already been running from the crazed family for five days or so when this movie started. Supposedly she was sawed in half from the stomach up, but this is simply not true, even in the unrated version that I watched. Yes, there is a vast quantity of blood in the scene, and yes, she does get brutally killed with the saw, but no, she does not get sawed in half and then her body peel off in two directions, having been split down the middle. It just doesn't happen. Nevertheless, I should think there is sufficient gore in the movie to satisfy all but the most depraved horror and Chainsaw fans, especially considering the sledge-hammer scene (which is based on a real police photo of Ed Gein's basement, and is one thing that the movie deserves at least some credit for), the above-mentioned chainsaw scene, and the scene where one character gets his head sawed almost in half at the ear level, although, as we later find out, does not kill him. If this is not enough for you, watch Day of the Dead. And if THAT is not enough for you, watch the news. There are plenty of videos coming from al Qaeda that are truly, truly disturbing. Viggo Mortensen, although he almost didn't get the part because his audition just didn't go very well, was outstanding as Tex, who is essentially the character that Matthew McConaughey plays in Texas Chainsaw 4, which is by leaps and bounds the worst of the series, including the 2003 remake (which I have not seen at the time of this writing, but it is physically impossible that it was worse than that ridiculous mess). There is one scene where Tex nails the heroine's hands to a wooden chair, and then casually asks her how she likes Texas. Pretty disturbing, but it doesn't make you want to slap your forehead, as McConaughey does from start to finish in part 4. Well, I'm sure she's having a blast, although the movie was filmed in California, incidentally about a 30-minute drive from where I live in Los Angeles. That's bike-riding distance for me. I was also impressed with the heroine in the movie, the obligatory girl who is the last to survive running from Leatherface (although this movie makes a slight variation on this trend at the end of the film). She manages to walk the fine line between sufficiently expressing her terror and not screaming mercilessly to the point where you just want her to get killed so she'll shut the hell up, and that is not an easy line to walk. I hope I'm not being misogynistic, but there is nothing worse in a horror film than the hysterical woman who simply screams and moans and won't respond when someone is trying to help her. I hate that. I have to admit that I was disappointed that the fancy new chainsaw, inscribed with the infamous quote 'The Saw is Family' and the most famous thing about this movie, was put to so little use. Not only is it not introduced until the majority of the killings are already done with another, much less shiny and interesting, chainsaw. And to make matters worse, not only is it underwater when it does its flesh-hacking (I guess the ability to run underwater was another of its special features), but the one character that it is allowed to sink its teeth into turns up not dead at the end of the film. Disappointing, true, but I have to say that Texas Chainsaw III is one of the better TCM films. Not as good as the original, but as good as the first sequel and light years better than the third sequel.",
         "Possibly a contender for one of -the most unfairly maligned horror entries of the VHS era, it is with pleasant surprise that I find myself confessing that I really liked \"Leatherface\" (to use its original - and more iconic - title... ) It's not a straight-up horror film like '74's first sojourn in Texas, but it's not totally ridiculous like the mid-80's return visit, either. Gone is the strange obsession the first sequel had with misguidedly over-the-top supposed comedic 'heroes'; the focus in the third shifts back to our favourite deranged family, where it should always have rested. Aside from a sleepy and badly-lit midsection where our potential victims try to escape through the woods, the script does well to keep variety high and the viewer on their toes with some deliciously uneasy moments. The vibe projected on this one fits into that late 80's/early 90's period for horror films with lots of dark humour and cool ideas in the mix. It may have been chopped up by the studio from what it originally was, but it's still a really entertaining watch, and for me sits side by side with the original in terms of quality because both scripts have entirely different tones.",
         "Two friends must deliver a car from coast to coast, but as they pass through the great southern state of Texas, things begin to get a little out of the ordinary. First, they are lured off the main highway to a deserted Texas road. And then here, they are stalked by the menacing Leatherface and his deranged family. Their only chance of escape, is a survivalist with enough fire power to blast Leatherface and the rest of the grizzly predators to hell. An excellent piece, definitely worth watching!!!"
