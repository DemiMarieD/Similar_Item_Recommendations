      "synopsis": "After the credits we open in a laboratory/control room for launching and monitoring satellites. Ellen Peters (Karen Kadler) announces that an unidentified object has been spotted. Her colleague, Pete Shelton (Charles B. Griffith) states that all aircraft should have been out of the area twenty minutes ago. The project manager, Dr. Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) notes that a commercial airliner is just off course. They are three minutes from launch. In Washington, D.C., Secretary Platt (Marshall Bradford) is meeting with Dr. Tom Anderson (Lee Van Cleef) when General Carpenter (David McMahon) enters the office. Anderson is there to beg Platt to call off the satellite project. When Anderson asks about the first satellite launched, he is told it exploded in orbit. Anderson tells them why, \"It was a warning. I anticipated that three years before it was launched.\" He informs them that, \"Alien intelligence watches us constantly.\" Much to his annoyance, Anderson is told the satellite has already been launched. At the Anderson home, Tom and his wife Claire (Beverly Garland) are entertaining Dr. Paul Nelson and his wife, Joan (Sally Fraser). They are just finishing dinner. Nelson reports that the satellite has been in orbit for three months and all is well. Joan voices her annoyance that the men are always talking shop. Claire's concern is more directed at her husband and what she feels are his delusions. The girls work on the dishes while the boys examine Anderson's new radio. He tunes in a station and tells Nelson that the sound is the planet Venus. Within the hum and static he tells Nelson to listen to the voice. At that moment, the phone rings. It is for Nelson; the project is calling to tell him the satellite left its orbit and flew out into space. The Nelsons hastily excuse themselves and drive to the nearby installation. The military lead, General Pattick (Russ Bender) arrives first. Pvt. Manuel Ortiz (Jonathan Haze) and Sgt. Neil (Dick Miller) clear him through the gate. The Andersons are in the living room. Claire is upset that her husband made a fool of himself in front of the Nelsons. The Nelsons arrive at the Installation and are cleared through. When Nelson enters the lab he's told by Pete Shelton that \"its back\". Pete, Ellen and Dr. Nelson exit the lab. Nelson tells them to get the reports to Washington before morning and that they'll bring the satellite down for a full examination. Nelson and his wife then drive home. It is early in the morning and Anderson gets out of bed and tunes in the radio set up in the living room. He's talking to something on board the satellite. Claire comes out to ask him back to bed. He tells her the creature from Venus is on board and will be coming to Earth to save us. Claire is exasperated; She is convinced her husband is crazy. The next day the team brings the satellite back, but something goes wrong. Instead of the designated landing area, it crash lands ten miles south of the Anderson home, at a location near a cave and hot springs. When Anderson tells his wife, \"he's alive, he survived the crash.\" She responds, \"Tom, youre a sick man.\" She tells him she's going into town and hopes he's better when she returns. The Venusian creature exits the satellite. It looks like a giant squash or pickle with horns and claws on long arms. Almost immediately electricity all over the world fails. The Nelson car stops on the road. At the installation the power is off and the phones are dead. Ellen Peters notes how quiet it is. Floyd Mason (Paul Harbor), her colleague, reminds her that it is always quiet in the mountains. Floyd tells the general that the satellite is down; the signals were coming through before the power failure. The Nelsons note the time as 3:03 p.m. when all the clocks stopped. They decide to walk up to the Anderson home to call a garage. Anderson is reading off names to his Venusian master. Eight people are on the list for mind control devices. The creature expels bat like flying objects that will home in on their prey. In town people are beginning to panic. The crowd asks Haskell (Thomas E. Jackson) the newspaper editor what's happening in the rest of the world. Haskell tells them he doesn't know; the wire service broke down. A woman asks Sheriff Shallert (Taggart Casey) what she can do about her husband's iron lung machine. Anderson comes into town to collect his wife and is attacked on the street by a man. The sheriff breaks up the fight. Nelson and Joan are closer to the Anderson home; they stop to rest. They notice one of the bat-like creatures flying. Nelson throws a rock at it, but it misses. The Andersons drive home. He has the only working vehicle on earth. He tells her that electricity and combustion engines have been disabled. Even the water won't work. Claire is incredulous; she turns on the hose on their house and nearly hits her husband with the stream. He tells her, \"That works because it belongs to me.\" As the Sheriff is pushing cars off the road in town the bat-creature stings him leaving an electrical device imbedded in his neck. Like a bee, once it has stung its target it dies. The victim immediately disposes of the dead creature. The Nelsons arrive at the Anderson home and are greeted on the steps. They are invited in for a drink. With all vehicles dead, General Pattick walks to headquarters. Along the way he encounters one of the bat-creatures. It stings him, and like the Sheriff he disposes of the dead creature. And like the Sheriff, he is now under the control of the Venusian. Anderson tells Nelson the story so far, but Nelson doesn't believe him. Nelson does ask why Anderson isn't fighting it. Anderson says that his friend is here on earth to rescue mankind not to conquer. Nelson and his wife get into the Anderson car while Anderson calls the Venusian to tell him to trace the energy from the car to locate and possess Dr. Paul Nelson and his wife, Joan. The Andersons drive the Nelsons home. At the installation, General Pattick tells the technicians that, \"Were in the midst of a Communist Uprising, they've sabotaged every power source in the area.\" He orders the staff to remain at the installation. The city of Beachwood is evacuated. Nelson takes his bike to the installation, but no sooner does he leave but a bat creature stings his wife, Joan. As he is biking through town he notices the Sheriff order Haskell out of town. When the newspaper editor refuses he is shot dead by the Sheriff. Nelson demands an explanation. When the Sheriff tells Nelson he is going to place him under protective custody, Nelson slugs him. The Sheriff cold cocks him with his gun, but before he can kill him gets a message from the Venusian to stop. He tells Nelson, \"you're to be one of us...Get up, you're free.\" Nelson gets back on his bike and leaves. Anderson tells his wife about the control devices--the bat-like creatures. They plant a radiological device in the subject's neck. He tells her that once infected they are subjects of the benefactor and lose all emotions. Claire is horrified by such a condition. Nelson arrives on his bicycle to find the installation closed. General Pattick is there to greet him. He tells Nelson that the staff was relocated to a nearby air base and that he and his wife should join them. He offers him a ride in the jeep and they put his bike in back. Nelson notices the jeep is running and suspects something. He invents a diversion, and hits the general on the back of the neck with his gun. He tosses the general out and commandeers the jeep. He drives to see Anderson and confronts him in his home. He calls him a murderer. Anderson tells him about the Venusian and the part he played. Anderson tries to convince Nelson about the benefit the alien proposes, but Nelson isn't buying any of it. Nelson leaves after calling Anderson a traitor. Claire tells her husband that he barely avoided being killed. Nelson had a gun. She chides him, \"you just had an undeserved stay of execution.\" He contacts the alien, but it refuses to meet with him. No sooner has Nelson's lack of control been reported, but his commandeered jeep stops running. Fortunately he has his bike in back and peddles home. It is dusk when he arrives, but he doesn't notice the lights are on, both outside and inside the house. His wife greets him. She has a control device and throws it at him, then leaves the house for a walk. Nelson fights it off and manages to kill the thing. As soon as the control device is killed Anderson calls Nelson and invites him back over to his house to talk. Nelson tells him he has something to do first. His wife comes home and he pretends to be controlled. She tells him they will be controlled for the rest of their lives. At this, he shoots and kills Joan. After his phone call, the alien tells Anderson to kill Nelson. Claire interrogates her husband about the Venusian. She tries her best to dissuade him from his grim task. He tells her the Venusian is established at Elephant Hot Spring cave because he needs a climate like Venus. He also tells her that Joan has been controlled. Two of the remaining devices have been used. The original targets were the mayor and his wife, but they were killed in the evacuation. Anderson won't tell his wife, but they were used on Pete and Floyd at the installation. At the installation, Ellen wakes up and notices all the equipment functioning. She goes to make coffee and finds the two dead control devices. Floyd kills Ellen while Pete looks on, unemotional. Nelson arrives at the Anderson home in Joan's station wagon. Claire makes her final appeal to her husband, but to no avail. He leaves the house to meet Nelson outside. Furious, she contacts the alien on the radio and threatens it, \"Do you hear that, I'm going to kill you.\" She grabs the rifle that Anderson placed on top of the radio and leaves the house through the garage. As Nelson and her husband walk up the stairs into the house she steals Joan's station wagon and departs armed and ready for a confrontation with the Venusian. She drives full speed to the cave. Nelson informs Anderson that his wife is dead. \"I killed her...not my wife, she wasn't my wife; She was a product of your work.\" He threatens Anderson, but wants information first. While Nelson interrogates Anderson, Claire arrives at the cave and enters looking for her quarry. As Anderson goes to retrieve his rifle he notices it is missing. Claire finds and confronts the Venusian, \"you're ugly, horrible...go on try your intellect on me...you think you're going to make a slave of the world...I'll see you in hell first.\" She fires round after round with no effect. It kills her while her husband hears it on the radio at home. That changes things for Anderson. He tells Nelson that he'll take him to the installation, that Pete and Floyd are controlled. He will go to the cave and kill the creature. Pvt. Ortiz, while out foraging for food, finds Joan's station wagon just outside the cave and hears Claire's screams. He enters the cave and fires at the creature, but manages to escape and return to his unit to report. Nelson enters the installation grounds and finds Ellen's body outside. He enters an office and shoots Pete, Floyd and General Pattick. He only manages to wound Pattick, but steals his working jeep. Anderson, in his own car, encounters the Sheriff blocking and guarding the road to the cave. He fires at Anderson, but Anderson circles around on foot and attacks him with a portable welding torch. The military detachment enters the cave. Gen. Pattick jumps into another jeep and heads for the cave. Nelson's jeep stops, he gets out and starts walking, but hears the general's jeep approaching and ambushes it. He shoots and kills the general and drives the jeep to the cave. The military unit opens fire on the Venusian, but it has little effect other than drawing it outside. Even a bazooka blast has no effect. Anderson pulls up in the commandeered police car and orders a cease fire. He lights up the torch and attacks the Venusian. It attacks and kills Anderson. They both die in a heap. Nelson pulls up in the jeep and gives his, \"he learned almost too late that man is a feeling creature...\" speech as we see the earth in space.",

         "Give me a break! The commentary for this movie cracks me up...why don't you nay-sayers give a second to remember WHEN it was made? It's one of the best examples of 50's drive-in treasure in collective memory. This silly yet earnest little movie has wormed it's way into the consciousness of anyone who's ever seen it. Paul Blaisdell's Venusian Carrot remains one of the most memorable aliens to ever grace the screen! Add to this total piece of weirdness one of Beverly Garland's best performances, most memorable in her first sighting of the Carrot: \"So that's what you look like.....You're ugly!!!\". Where was her Oscar for delivering this line with total conviction (and a straight face?) Yes, there was life before bloated CGI computer effects, and this superior potboiler proves yet again that once upon a time, imagination and ingenuity could work wonders. One of the all time-great sci-fi movies!",
         "A lot of people slam Roger Corman and try and act like every movie he made was worthless schlock, but while he definitely did make a few stinkers in his long career, the truth is that he was involved with more good than bad movies, either as a director or a producer. In fact, some of the movies he directed were better than just \"good\" e.g. 'The Trip' and 'Bloody Mama'. His early reputation mainly rests on his quickie monster movies, and 'It Conquered The World' is one of the most entertaining. So okay, it a low budget movie (and I mean LOW), it's very naive and the special effects are poor. The Venusian monster and the flying bat things will probably inspire fits of giggles in most people, but despite all that the movie has lots of energy and it hooks you straight in. It's also helped enormously by having an above average cast. The two leads are Peter Graves and Lee Van Cleef. Graves later became immortal on TV as Mr. Phelps in 'Mission: Impossible', and Van Cleef became a Western icon via his work in movies such as 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' and 'Death Rides A Horse'. Van Cleef gives an intense performance as a scientist obsessed with communication with aliens. Graves is his more level headed colleague. When Van Cleef intercepts messages from an extraterrestrial that only he can hear, his wife (Beverly Garland) and Graves think he is cracking up. He co-operates with the alien, helping it to try and take over the world. Garland is best known to most people for her later work on TV (e.g.'My Three Sons'), but boy is she sexy here! Hubba! Hubba! Being a Corman movie we shouldn't be surprised to see Dick Miller in the supporting cast. He plays a soldier, as does Jonathan Haze (Seymour in 'Little Shop Of Horrors) 'It Conquered The World' isn't up to the standards of such 1950s SF classics as 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' or 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers', but it's lots of fun, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys b-grade movies from this period.",
         "This is an entertaining, well acted, well edited film of its genre. Classic anti-communist fear, rubber monster, Roger Corman trash fun. Heavily cut on its initial release. BEWARE, the only available DVD release from Siren Entertainment (coupled with Creature from the Haunted Sea) retains these cuts. 29 cuts in total including ALL IMAGES of the monster! Ludicrously, while all images of our rubber friend are removed, most of the human to human violence, some of which is quite strong, remains. I will never understand censorship ! Where Siren entertainment got this copy from I do not know. The film deserves a restored, uncut release.",
         "One of the most entertaining sci-fi/horror films of the 50s. Very much camp with 3 all-time great B-actors (Garland, Graves, Van Cleef, one of the best B-casts ever). I love every minute of it. Includes John Haze and Dick Miller as army grunts and an out of this world monster by the now-legendary Paul Blaisdell. The best scene is where Beverly Garland confronts the monster from Venus: \"You think you can make a slave of this world? Well, I'll see you in hell first!\" Fans of the Sergio Leone \"Fistfull of Dollars\" flicks should enjoy seeing Lee Van Cleef as a scientist who's betrayed the planet earth by helping the monster come to this planet and take over the show. Apparently, however, the \"World\" in this case consists of the environs of Grifftih Park and a few houses up on Coldwater Canyon. The monster is exceptionally poor -- you can see Blaisdell shoving the bat creatures out of the bottom of the suit. This is a must-see for anyone with a sense of humor. It is not a bad movie -- it is a witty, fun, romping good time.",
         "Sci-fi about a creature from Venus coming to Earth. A scientist (Lee van Cleef) gets in touch with it through some machine. He believes the creature wants to bring peace and helps guide it to Earth. Naturally the creature wants to possess and conquer... Infamous Roger Corman movie which has one of the silliest aliens ever filmed. It's also pretty stupid, dull in spots and laughable. But the acting is actually good (Peter Graves and Beverly Garland especially) and I DO find the alien at the end just...unbelievable. Also it does have two instances of over the top violence (for its time)--a man is set on fire and the thing gets its eye poked out (this is cut from some non-cable prints). Not good but 100 times better than its remake \"Zontar the Thing from Venus\". And Garland and Graves ARE good. I give it a 5.",
         "What adjective is best to use when describing a film where Peter Graves fights what looks like the Good Humor alien while also shooting its bat-like minions, ending with a speech about man's nature as being \"feeling\"? Well, if it was directed by Roger Corman, it has to be quirky! Drama-wise, the film does well, even if it is an obvious steal from \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" AND \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\". The male leads, Peter Graves and Lee Van Cleef, perform admirably, but it is Beverly Garland of My Three Sons who steals the show as Van Cleef's ever-suffering wife (\"I won't love a monster, I won't!\") And, of course, there's always the regular Corman cast of stock players, including the cute Sally Fraser, who unfortunately is shot (by her husband, no less - good gravy, this whole film is rather sexist! Killing off all the women characters? Pretty pushy, even back then.) And Russ Bender as the possessed general. And who would've suspected that Dick Miller and Jonathan Haze are the comedy relief soldiers? Let's hope those bat things aim carefully.",
         "It Conquered the World seems to be trapped in a sort of sci-fi Twilight Zone. Though it has a sizable cult following that appreciates its quirky genius, there are many genre fans who dismiss it as b-grade schlock. Rarely mentioned on lists of science fiction greats from the fertile 50s, the movie nonetheless survives and continues to entertain genre fans today. That It Conquered the World is a b-movie is undeniable--indeed, it is a near-perfect example of the type--but its b-movie status doesn't mean it can't be good. And it is actually quite good. The story of an alien intelligence that takes advantage of a disillusioned scientist to plot a takeover of Earth, It Conquered the World is incredibly ambitious. The globe-spanning plot was typical of science fiction from the period, but director Roger Corman didn't have the budget of War of the Worlds or Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers. Corman had to rely on imagination, and his audience's willing suspension of disbelief. Yes, the limited sets and small cast at Corman's disposal don't always do the story justice--crowd scenes are not particularly crowded, the military response to the emergency is about 1/100th what it should be, etc.--but as a result the more intimate drama becomes a fascinating character study, and the multi-layered plot works as both Cold War paranoia thriller and introspective morality play. Corman and writer Lous Rusoff (and an uncredited Charles B. Griffith) are working with a complex, thoughtful plot that belies the movie's b-level reputation. And the cast does wonders with the story. Headliners Lee Van Cleef and Robert Graves are solid as the scientists whose friendship turns bitter once it becomes clear that Van Cleef has sold his soul to the devil in exchange for revenge upon a cruel world. The beautiful Beverly Garland is often singled out for her outstanding performance as Van Cleef's desperate wife, and her nuanced portrayal of a woman trying in vain to pull her husband out of the pit is indeed excellent, and with her gorgeous looks, charm, and a killer scream Garland is one sci-fi's earliest great scream queens. Often overshadowed by Garland's performance, Sally Fraser's role as Graves's benighted wife is nearly as important to the plot, and Fraser's transformation from a caring, decent woman to alien-possessed temptress is highly convincing. Dick Miller, a genre stalwart, plays an army sergeant whose platoon is hunting the alien down...but what can they hope to do to \"It\" if they find it? Critics often blast this movie's special effects, and there's no denying they really aren't that special. But the script doesn't demand a lot of dazzling pyrotechnics, except for the climax, and the lack of high-end spectacle doesn't really take anything away from the drama. The creature design for \"It\" is much-maligned, but there is something wonderfully malevolent about \"It\" that overcomes any shortcomings. In any event, \"It\" spends most of the film lurking in the shadows, where many cinematic monsters are more frightening anyway. Despite the lack of sophisticated FX, even by 50s standards, the story itself draws you inexorably in, and the effects, limited as they are, nonetheless work within the context of the overall plot. Beyond the natural problems generated by the miniscule budget--most of which Corman manages to overcome--the film's biggest problem is pacing. The script, character driven as it is, is necessarily rather talky. Much of the dialog is vital to the surprisingly philosophical plot, but the relative dearth of action is a genuine weakness, and the film does feel rather longer than it really is. While there are moments of humor, the script generally takes itself quite seriously, and the performers do a good job of avoiding the temptation to surrender to parody. It Conquered the World is hard to find these days, but if you can locate a used tape or catch it on late-night TV there are few sci-fi gems from the great 50s that can equal its ambition and creativity. Well-written, competently acted and imaginatively directed, It Coqnuered the World is one of the best b-movies ever made.",
         "It conquered the world is one of my favorite sci fi movies of the 50,s.OK,so the monster is a little ridiculous looking but that just adds to the fun.Beverly Garland is terrific as lee van cleefs aggravated wife and she gives some great screams in her moment of terror.It,s eerie to see people you once trusted turn against you,not of their own volition of course.This movie has good murder scenes,people getting shot down and a great strangling scene,not to mention the monsters way of finishing off his victims.Try to catch this film.It,s corny but habit forming.",
         "This movie was originally given an 'X' rating in England, and was almost banned. This was in reaction to the violent treatment of the alien at the movie's end (it's shot many times and has a blow torch put to its right eye). The concern was not over the violence itself, but rather that an \"animal\" was its object. The movie's director argued the alien was not an animal, but rather an intelligent being. Incredibly, based on this redefinition of the alien the ban was removed. The movie itself? It's lots of fun with some good and familiar actors. If you're old enough to have seen this type of movie as a kid it'll bring back some pleasant memories.",
         "While It Conquered the World can't compare with some of the best sci-fi from the 50s, it's still a fun movie if you can get past the special effects. The plot is straight out of the 1950s Guide to Sci-Fi/Monster Movies. An alien comes to earth with the intention of taking over the place. The alien uses some sort of bat looking things to help him gather \"volunteers\" to his cause (they hit them in the back of the neck and inject them with some mind-control device). The biggest difference between the plot of It Conquered the World and other similar movies is that one character, Dr. Tom Anderson (Lee Van Cleef), is in communication with the alien and willingly tries to help him. This brings the whole Red Scare subtext found in a lot of these movies to the front as Dr. Anderson's friend and colleague Dr. Paul Nelson (Peter Graves) calls him a traitor. Being called a traitor (i.e. a commie) was about as bad as you could get in the 50s. One thing that elevates It Conquered the World is the cast. You don't expect (at least I don't expect) to see names like Peter Graves, Lee Van Cleef, Beverly Garland, and Dick Miller in the same low budget Roger Corman film. I can't think of many movies shot on this kind of budget with four names I'm so familiar with. Corman really had a knack for spotting young talent. The less said about the special effect the better. The monster is not as bad or poorly thought out as something like Ro-Man from Robot Monster, but it comes close to being just as silly. It Conquered the World might have benefited from not showing the monster. I recently watched The Space Children and noted that Jack Arnold was wise to limit his monster's screen time. What I wrote for that film applies here too \u0096 \"Too often, low-budget sci-fi films from this period look ridiculous because of the desire for elaborate special effects (i.e. monster and aliens) that outstripped the funding it would require.\" In the end, while you can certainly find better sci-fi from the 1950s than It Conquered the World, you can just as easily find much worse. This one is about average but worth at least one look if you're into this kind of thing. You might want to check it out just to hear Peter Graves closing speech \u0096 \"Man is a feeling creature, and because of it the greatest in the universe. He learned too late for himself that men have to find their own way, to make their own mistakes. There can't be any gift of perfection from outside ourselves. When men seek such perfection they find only death, fire, loss, disillusionment and the end of everything that's gone forward. Men have always sought an end to our misery but it can't be given, it has to be achieved. There is hope, but it has to come from inside, from Man himself.\" It's worth the price of admission if you ask me!"
