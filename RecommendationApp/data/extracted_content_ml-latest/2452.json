         "While this movie could have been much better, it is what you might expect for a low budget sequel to a b-movie. With that being said, I think the film recalls enough of the charm that made the first a borderline cult classic to hold the interest of those who were fans of the original. One returning character, one returning plot line, one returning minion. So for fans, its a nice hidden rental when your Netlflix Que runs low on must-sees, especially if there other fans out they're like me who didn't even know there was a sequel. I happened to be looking to rent the original and saw this as well. It sat at the bottom of my list for a while but finally I decided to give it a chance and while not blow away, I was satisfied enough by the nostalgic cheesiness this film provided.",
         "** stars out of ****. While it lacks the superior effects of the original, The gate 2 is an O.K. horror film. The plot is pretty much a rehash of the original: A teen unleashes demons, but this time, rather then coming out of a gate, the little demons come out of us. Acting is good, and the characters are realistic and appealing (At least avoid cliches for the most part) and there is some humorous parts. The F/X are good, especially during the multi-monster finale, even though they are second rate compared to the original. still not a bad try for Director Tibor.",
         "This deserves better than it's getting here! Anyone who's seen The Gate, also starring Louis Tripp, would agree. I looked a long time to find a copy of it and finally got one, very-well-used copy for more $$ than I care to spend on videos, but I paid it because I like to watch this movie a couple times a year, and video stores don't usually carry it. It's a solid 7 outta 10 in my book! Good chemistry among these young actors/actress! Nice, dark, creepy feel to the otherworldliness it depicts! Yeah, I like it a lot! So sue me!",
         "~Spoiler~ The Gate II is one of the most unnecessary sequels in all of our genre. As is evident within the movie, there is no story to continue. They just made stuff up. The movie centers on a group of kids (one of whom is Louis Tripp from the first film) who conjure a demon, capture him, and use him to grant wishes. Of course, the wishes eventually turn to crap. Literally. What this has in common with The Gate, I don't know? Let me just say when the only returning cast member is not a good actor nor the hero of the first movie, you're in trouble. And what really shocks me is that the original writer and director are both on board. That's very unusual and rarely results with a movie this inept (of course there is The Hills Have Eyes 2). I don't count The Gate II as a wasted opportunity, it's just a waste period. It never should have been made.",
         "Sadly, despite some decent creature effects ranging from an actor in a demon costume to old school stop-motion animation, Gate II offers very little to the viewer with it's sub-standard storyline and dull characters. One never really feels that the four teens are in that great a danger...and the low budget seems to have had a greater affect on the production this time around. A surprisingly disappointing sequel (considering that the 1987 original was so well done) that is recommended for the unwavering, die-hard Gate fan only. Gate II was filmed in 1989 but sat on the shelf for three years until the resolution of distribution problems earned it a limited (yet ultimately unsuccessful) theatrical release in 1992.",
         "A rather obscure(..and, more than likely, remain obscure)sequel to the entertaining 80's offering, The Gate, brings two of the components that made the first a success..Louis Tripp returns as troubled and lonely nerd Terrence and the director pulling strings once again, Tibor Takács. This film takes a different direction than the first for instead of keeping it in a central location, the house possessed, this film follows Terrence and the problems that exist when he decides to go fooling around with the demonic gateway again. This time three obnoxious teenagers, Liz(Pamela Segall), John(James Villemaire), and Moe(Simon Reynolds), butt in on Terrence as he is attempting to open the gateway in the remains of his former neighbor friend's house. Terrence, in his carefully studied research, finds that you can call forth a demon and get wishes granted with proper persuasion. So John, the clichéd bully and his stooge, Moe wish to push around Terrence and mock his even trying to do such a thing as conjuring demons. But, through the insistence of believer Liz, John and Moe humor Terrence to a degree and partake in his little ceremony. This ceremony yields the result of a demon(one of those little demons that like to bite..we seen many of them in the first film)who is instantly shot by John because he is in this film to simply cause conflict and aggravation. He's a butt-head and Moe is here to be his lackey to run into trouble with. Obviously, Liz will warm to Terrence because he is the supposed hero of the picture, though to be honest he's a wee bit creepy in his Satanic garb and \"demon-speak\". He actually admits to Liz that he only wishes to conjure the demon so that his job-less, drunk father could get his pilot job back. Each of the four teens get wishes when they threat the demon(..who is able to come back to life when Terrence keeps him in a jar of liquid). They find that their wishes , though, have serious drawbacks via \"Monkey's Paw.\" This film, as directed by Takács is not as thrilling as the original because it takes us deep within the whole demonic angle which often descends into foolishness, especially when wishes are granted then taken away. The whole mythology of the gateway as it pertains to Terrence and his cohorts can really get confusing as we hear how everything works and see it. John and Moe try to kidnap the demon to get wishes granted and find that their bodies have become the way out of hell for the \"Unholy trinity\" who need Terrence as the third gateway and Liz as the sacrifice. The ending has them in another dimension with Terrence about to slay poor Liz who begs for him to fight the force taking him over. It's a weird film, and for that alone this might be interesting for those searching for something different. I guess those who like the first film might try to check it out, but may be disappointed to find it takes a whole different approach. The scares and creepy atmosphere is not present, but the film is so unusual and weird, The gate 2 might just be your kind of diversion from the norm of today's horror film.",
         "The original \"The Gate\" was cheap but very entertaining, and had a great feel to it. This film doesn't. They even gave it an \"R\" rating, something the original didn't have and didn't need. I don't think it's the worst horror film ever made, but it certainly could have been better. Maybe a third entry might redeem the series...",
         "I first want to say that I liked the first gate film a lot, and even though it's been a while since I've seen it but I remember enough to compare it to number one. The characters in this film, though stereotypes, have much more of a real feel to them than other films like this. Those characters help make the story compelling. The acting out of these characters is fair, with the exception of Our (SPOILER) main character, the nerdy neighbor kid, from the first one. I know some people liked him, but I thought he was a tad wooden. story is the biggest difference from The Gate. Whereas The Gate has a grander, action filled Premise, The Gate II: Trespassers has a slow build to an explosive ending. Don't think they went cheap on us though, because this \"slow build\" is filed with great stop motion special effects, thanks to the single minion ( the tiny guys from the first one) who gets a fair a mount of screen time. But let's get onto the ending, where things get sketchy. The start of the climax is excellent, but the final \"battle\" is just cheesy and a little disappointing. That's really too bad considering the rest of the film was great. And also if you're expecting scary, you may be disappointed. This film has it's moments, but the original is much scarier. In all The Gate II: Trespassers is a decent film, and if you're looking for some effects laden fun, check this out!",
         "If you watch this movie you will no doubt find out what I mean by bad, intentional or not? The acting is so far beyond good that it makes Troma flicks into Oscar worthy pictures. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Troma, but you know what I'm saying. This has parts that are funny and parts that are pretty decent. It also has a lot of bad parts to it too. But I think the bad is actually meant to be that way. If it is, then I can cut it some slack. The two buddies, Johnny and his hole-in-the-heart buddy, Moe are perfect examples of the \"bad\" acting aspect of the movie. I think they are funny, because they are so horrible it can't be for real. The magic is actually thought out somewhat, although I'm sure using English won't help to raise many ancient demons from billions of years ago. I do believe that hamster sacrifice is a no-no as well. But you have to give them credit for going off the reservation and trying to be cute and clever and more along the lines of an offbeat dark/horror/comedy flick. Not too bad, not the best. Try it if you have watched a lot of other stuff first.",
         "Sequel filmed in 1989, but released in 1992 in the states, doesn't come close to being on par with the original. Terry, Stephen Dorff's buddy from the original, returns here and this picks up sometime after the last films events. Terry's life sucks so he decides to mess around with the spells that brought out the first films demons. This time, they don't come out of a hole in the backyard, they come out from within you. Plus, they grant wishes, which eventually turn to crap (literally). Below average sequel could really have been good, since the original film's supporting actor and director were included in this project. It starts off promising, with a beginning that looks like it's gonna continue from the original, but then the story goes off in a different direction, introducing ideas and sequences that are somewhat interesting at first, but are portrayed in a somewhat slim and rushed manner, making things rather awkward. By the end of the film, the thing is disappointing, and doesn't look anything like a movie that should have followed-up The Gate. It's too bad there is no hope of a Gate 3, because the original had a good, tight story, likable characters and sequences with lots of imagination. Gate 2 could have been better. The slack pace, campiness, and shallow annoying characters hamper this sequel I remember waiting for a few years at the time to come out. See the original if you like horror. Skip this mis-fire. Pamela Segall Adlon does voices for King Of The Hill. One Star."
