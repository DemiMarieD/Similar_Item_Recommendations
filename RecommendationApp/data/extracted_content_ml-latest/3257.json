      "synopsis": "In her film debut, Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron, a pop music superstar. It seems that one of her fans is stalking her and has threatened to kill her, so Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a professional bodyguard and former Secret Service agent, is hired to protect her. The film then follows Rachel Marron's life from performance to performance. Each performance features her singing a song (including Houston's hits I Will Always Love You and I Have Nothing) that reflects her emotional state. Frank Farmer successfully protects her from danger. Subsequently, and possibly as a result of his protection and the trust thus inspired, Rachel Marron falls in love with Frank, and, though he tries to keep their relationship professional, they sleep together. However, recognizing that their relationship puts her and her family in danger, he breaks-off the affair and heightens moves to protect her (many such previous moves were shot down by Rachel). Ironically, in an effort to separate Rachel from her own world, Frank introduces Rachel to his own father and personal life. As the story follows a number of potential stalkers, Rachel must put her trust in Frank ahead of her own selfishness and desire for success; as Frank must face the fact that the threat may not be what was expected. In the end, Frank's duty is fulfilled, having successfully protected Rachel, and they part with a kiss. Frank then moves on to his next assignment...to protect an archbishop.",

         "The story of a superstar singer who falls in love with her bodyguard could have been a major disaster. I remember the previews and thinking it was going to be one. However once the film was out and I actually watched it I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a really good romance and a really good thriller. Of course its hokey and Hollywood and all of that but you get sucked in and carried along for its running time. Trust me this is better than you think it is. The only problem is that the film is a bit too long to do what it has to do. I think the problem is in the early part of the film where all of th e pieces are being set in motion, however once its all going its great. Get some popcorn your honey and enjoy.",
         "Why do people trash this movie? It's not high art but it's thoroughly entertaining. WH's performance in this movie is better than all her others...just watch the scene when she asks Frank Farmer to take her on a date. Natural, unaffected and charming. Kevin Costner underplays his role and I enjoyed watching him. I just bought the anniversary DVD and it has great backstage footage and very interesting tidbits. For example, it was Kevin Costner's idea, against a lot of protest, to have WH sing the first few bars of 'I will Always Love You' acapella. Smart man. And it is interesting to listen to the comments of Costner about this movie. He was a major star but he waited and held up production of this movie a year so he could get WH. He didn't want anyone else and was willing to wait for her. He refused to interject a story line that would 'explain' the Black/White thing (Bravo). And although Black/White pairings are fairly common now, THEN, for a major star to have a real black love interest ( and an untested actress at that) was a bold move. And it paid off. I don't know why he has not been as successful recently. The DVD interviews were done about 2 yrs ago and WH was still drug crazy (so no interviews with her) but Kevin Costner's last words in the interviews are about her and he said, among other things, that he would always love Whitney. Their chemistry was spot on. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE.",
         "The Bodyguard is fundamentally a love story between two contrasting characters with their own idiosyncrasies. The plot is intriguing enough to carry the film through and the romance between Costner and Houston builds steadily and realistically. With some decent action scenes, a decent cast and a great soundtrack, i found the Bodyguard to be an enjoyable movie. Clearly this film is not for everyone, it doesn't have enough action to satisfy the action fans, it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller and as a pure romance film it is fairly weak; but i have to admit it does balance between these 3 genres quite well without excelling in any one of them. 7/10",
         "Frank Farmer is a top line bodyguard, formerly secret service protector to President Reagan, he is approached to guard Rachel Marron, the latest pop sensation on the cusp of Hollywood domination. After initially being reluctant to take the job, Farmer gets to the task of protecting Rachel from a potential maniac who's been sending her threatening letters. As the initial in camp hostilities die down, Frank & Rachel start to draw ever closer, but so does the person who wants her dead... The Bodyguard is one of those films that was long in gestation, originally mooted in 1976 to star Steve McQueen (it was written with McQueen in mind in the 60s) and Diana Ross, it was put on the back burner after McQueen fell ill to the cancer that killed him. Then it resurfaced in 1979 with Diana Ross to play opposite Ryan O'Neal, but the two stars just couldn't get on and the project again fell by the wayside. Enter Kevin Costner and his boys at TIG Productions, original choice to star alongside Costner, Maddona, ruined her chance (thankfully) of starring after being a bitch to Costner in her Truth Or Dare documentary. In stepped Whitney Houston (brilliantly diva casting), Costner gave himself a crew cut (in homage to McQueen) and The Bodyguard went on to make $410,900,000 worldwide. The film now seems like a myth to me because the rating across many forums is on the low side, critics hate it and you will be hard pressed to find macho film fans readily about to own up to liking the picture. That's a shame because as undeniably nonsense as it is, it has got a great thriller heart to blend in with its romantic core. The good ship Bodyguard may dock at all the formula ports in the genres, but it's one hell of a journey getting to the end, even with that song that seemed to top the charts for years! (the soundtrack to the movie selling 17 million in America alone). In spite of the obviousness of the plot, and the general feeling of familiarity, The Bodyguard has much going for it, things that ensured it became a monster hit and had cinema goers queueing round the block to see it. Houston is something of a revelation, here she nails the diva bitch heart of gold portrayal of Rachel with astonishing ease, and couple that with a voice sent from some deity paradise far away, makes her total value for money. Costner also stepped up to the plate to win a new breed of fans as Farmer, his charm and laid back manner works well with a ruggedness that the male viewers could easily get on side with. The rest of the cast are merely playing second fiddle to the well matched up leads, and outside of Gary Kemp becoming increasingly annoying as the film progresses, they all blend in well to create what is now a sadly undervalued picture. See it with someone you love, don't just take my word for it, look at the box office take, it doesn't lie. 7/10",
         "The Bodyguard is a movie with many flows and one redeeming factor: the WH factor. People went to see this picture because they wanted to see Whitney singing and she delivered some of her most passionate vocal performances before the mesmerised eyes of her millions of fans on the big screen. Let's face it, who wants to see her acting when she can sing so beautifully? The unrelenting criticism by couch 'drama experts' of her acting seems a tad over the top. She never claimed to be an actress and despite this being her film debut, she did not disgrace herself. She did the best she could with what she was given: a patchy character with very little to say. What else could she do to play this role? Well, just what she did, sing her heart out. The best thing that Kevin Costner did was to insist that Whitney was the only one he wanted for this part. He knew he had a winner, but he also tried to do too much with the story: a romantic thriller with patches of 'comedy', a study in professional-personal conflict and 'who done it' thrown in. That's the reason for the plot's erratic turns and the non existent character development. The glue that holds the whole mess together is Whitney, the singer, looking stunning and sounding like an angel. This could have been a gigantic flop and instead it was a massive hit. It will remain a phenomenon in popular culture because it delivered what the vast majority of its audience wanted: escapism, a couple of hours away from their own reality and a look inside the glamorous life of a superstar. They were entertained by a great pop singer, who had made a huge video clip for her songs and they did not mind paying for the privilege. Those who hate The Bodyguard, went to see it with some unrealistic expectations of 'serious cinema and acting'?! Hey, go to see foreign movies with subtitles for that and come down from your pretentious cloud.",
         "I have watched many action movies but this one makes one think: what happens next? This material could have been handled badly, but it comes out refined and elegant. Both Whitney Hustoun and Kevin Costner stay true to their types, yet sharing a common purpose giving a spiritual dimension to the movie as observed by a commentator. This is not a conventional romantic movie and that is why many are disappointed. It is a throwback to old concepts of chivalry and knighthood. The remarkable point to observe is that it is a modern story about an independent woman and her child. This is a movie which feels good and genuine in the end.",
         "Oh my, what a wonderful movie. Hollywood is known for churning out a lot of sentimental mush that's supposed to pass for romance. But, thankfully, this is not one of those movies. In this movie the main characters, the bodyguard and the lady he is hired to protect, are likable and have a relationship that develops into something really beautiful and special. Moreover, the story is plausible and the movie is well-acted too, with Whitney Houston turning in an outstanding performance reminiscent of Diana Ross's in Lady Sings the Blues (which is another great movie). If you want to watch a movie with good acting and an engaging story, then this is the movie to watch.",
         "I just recently watched The Bodyguard again and i forgot how good it was. Costner plays the role of the obsessed bodyguard perfectly and Houston's first feature film performance was flawless. This story of an obsessed stalker terrorising a famous performer and the bodyguard trying to protect her at all costs, was made in a refreshing way, even to compete with todays movie standards Mick Jackson's The Bodyguard is a great movie to watch over and over again even when you find out whodunnit .",
         "A movie/music star who needs protection from a psychotic fan, wow what a concept. And who better to play it than Whitney Houston, a stretch I know. The plot is totally disappointing and bland. Luckily the on-screen romance and chemistry from Houston and Costner, along with a great soundtrack, save this film from being a total bust. The love story between Costner and Houston becomes the main driving force, preventing the film from running out of ideas. In the end the romance is what you take away from the film, not the convoluted mystery plot. It's enjoyable in the end and I would recommend it. Of course the soundtrack is one of the best and most popular in history with \"I Will Always Love You\", \"Run to You\", \"I Have Nothing\", and \"I'm Every Woman.\"",
         "I was interested to note from your \"Trivia\" page that it was originally intended to make this film in the seventies with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the leading roles, but that the film never got made because it was \"too controversial\". The cause of the controversy was presumably the mixed-race love-affair between Frank and Rachel, as there is little else in the script that might upset anyone. The story centres around Frank Farmer, a former Secret Service agent now working as a private bodyguard. He is hired by Rachel Marron, an African-American pop star, who has been receiving death threats, presumed to come from a mad stalker. Frank's obsessive concern with security initially alienates both Rachel and some of the other members of her entourage, but, after a number of misunderstandings, he becomes first her friend and then her lover. He, however, is unhappy about becoming emotionally involved with a client and ends the affair. He would also like to end his employment with Rachel, but she is becoming genuinely frightened for her own safety, and he agrees to stay on to protect her when it is clear that she is in danger from an unexpected source. When I first saw this film in the cinema I disliked it. I was a great admirer of Kevin Costner's performance in \"Dances with Wolves\", and I went to see \"The Bodyguard\" in the hope that it would be a film of similar scope and vision. Of course, it isn't, but then it was never intended to be. Having seen it again recently on television, I was rather more impressed than I had been the first time. There is a respectable performance from Costner as Frank, a man who on the surface seems cold and detached but who hides his emotions under the surface- not only his love for Rachel, but also his feelings of guilt stemming from the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981. Frank was not on duty at the time- in fact, he was attending his mother's funeral- but he cannot escape from the thought that, if he had been present, he could have prevented the President from being shot. Whitney Houston is a beautiful woman, with a beautiful voice which was shown off to good advantage in this film. Her rendition of \"I Will Always Love You\" is one of the most haunting ballads I know, far superior to the Dolly Parton original. Her character is supposed to be an actress as well as a singer- the finale actually takes place as she receives a \"Best Actress\" award at the Oscars. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that Whitney will ever emulate her alter ego in this respect, as her acting is certainly not in the same class as her voice. She seems to have too small an emotional range, and it is no surprise that her subsequent film career has been so patchy. \"The Bodyguard\" is a perfectly adequate thriller-romance, if at times too slow-moving, but I felt that it might have been better with a more commanding female lead. 6/10"
