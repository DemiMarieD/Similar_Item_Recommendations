         "Okay, so maybe I'm a little biased by the fact that I'm in my late teens, but personally, I wasn't a big fan of this movie. Very unrealistic, cartoony...in short, standard Disney live-action material. As adult fare, it definitely doesn't get a high rating in my book. BUT, the movie does have its merits. Specifically, like all Disney movies, it has an ability to enchant just about every young child under the age of 12. I saw it while keeping an eye on a group of 9-year-olds, and while I found myself glancing at my watch to see if the film was almost over, the children (boys AND girls, I might add!) were sitting on there seats watching in rapt fascination, wishing that they could BE the Deedles. I had the same experience recently when I watched in on TV with pair of 11-year-olds I was taking care of for the evening...they loved it! So, in short, I'd warn adults away from it, but don't ban it from your house, as it could come in handy if you have some unruly kids around!",
         "This movie served its purpose. It was incredibly ridiculous, fun to watch, and had Paul Walker shirtless in it. It is obviously a movie targeted at 5th graders, but die-hard Paul fans won't be disappointed. I hate to be a typical teenage girl about this, but who wouldn't want to see a movie w/ Paul Walker shirtless? This movie by no means stresses his acting ability, but he looks great. Warning: Some scenes involving AJ Langer will make you want to hurl. But of course, that is what the fast-forward button is for. I recommend it for Paul Walker fans and immature people.",
         "This is simply just another of those predictably lame \"family\" movies that makes a huge effort to be hip and cool. It will come as no surprise to those familiar with such high-budget / low-ambition junk to learn that this film is neither hip or cool. The two lead characters, the \"Deedle's\" of the title are a pair of nimrod's who's constant stupidity is neither amiable or endearing it's just damned irritating and the allegedly comical scrapes they get into are too improbable and silly to ever raise anything more than a half-forced smile. Being a horror fan it was inevitable I would dislike this movie. The only reason I bothered watching it is because it features the mouth-wateringly sexy A.J Langer, who also starred in Wes Craven's excellent \"The People Under The Stairs\". She is the only real reason for watching this film. One to avoid on practically all levels.",
         "\"Meet the Deedles\" is a relatively unknown film with Paul Walker in a lead role early in his career. My kids and I enjoyed watching this movie together several times when they were young (ten and under). A lighthearted family comedy, it's both silly and sweet, with a number of memorable funny phrases that still make us laugh over ten years later. \"Meet the Deedles\" includes positive messages about taking responsibility for yourself, learning to be independent, having goals, working hard, and being close with family. While it may not be Academy Award material, \"Meet the Deedles\" has a certain simplicity and innocence that is refreshing--including a happy ending, which is really nice for a change. While still feeling shocked and saddened by Paul Walker's recent death at such a young age, I am thankful for his contribution to this film and hope more people will now watch and enjoy it.",
         "Well, I think the common theme from the reviews I've read is that kids love this movie. Which is not surprising since I believe that is what Disney's target market is. And if you are a Paul Walker fan like myself, you will watch and enjoy the movie just for the eye candy. This film is brainlessly funny or funnily brainless. Whatever. I got what I wanted from this film. I enjoyed it. I knew that there will be slapstick comedy. That the humor will be childish. But I don't care. I recommend this movie for those who felt like their brain has just been bludgeoned after a long hard day attending meetings, discussions, brain storming sessions, analyzing and calculating numbers... you get the picture.",
         "As another reviewer said; \"I recommend it for Paul Walker fans and immature people.\" Being both these things I was wetting myself laughing at a fair few points of the film. Mainly because I find farts very very funny indeed. I had a rip-roaring hangover this afternoon and decided to put on a film that was so simple it required no thinking whatsoever to watch. This was the ideal thing. It's cringe worthy and very tacky at times but that doesn't mean it's absolute rubbish. Worth a watch if you're into tacky comedies that rely heavily on bodily function jokes or if you want to see Paul Walker in a wetsuit. I'd like him to put a Deedle in my haystack.......",
         "I am heartened to see that, for a change, most others agree with me on the dopiness of this flick. Therefore I shall simply add that this has nothing to do with Yellowstone National Park. The \"filmmakers\" knew nothing about it but that Old Faithful is there and knew nothing about national parks but that rangers wear uniforms. I watched this to see how goofily unrealistic the geysers and hotsprings would look. Surprise, there aren't any, besides a spout of water in the background (Old Faithful) and a love scene in a hot-tub (the hidden hotspring). Disney couldn't even be bothered to make some plastic scenery! Yes, along with each other Hollywood film, they simply set everything in the studio's grassy fields with California's generic mountains in the background. The park's geology and animal-life are joyfully manipulated by the HEROES as the SOLUTIONS to the villain's evil actions. To the filmmakers, the only difference between commercial tourist attractions and national parks is that national park employees wear ranger uniforms. And these are the same people getting worked up over global warming? For sure. But any film with A J Langer is worth at least 3 stars.",
         "It was OK, my little brother seemed to enjoy it. It had some laughs, but it was dumb, stupid, no plot-line, but it was funny in parts, and had some good \"stunts\". 5 out of 10 or ** out of ****",
         "those of you who think this is a bad movie either think that because you have terrible taste or you think you're too cool for ridiculous humor. If you've seen this movie you know it's funny. If you haven't seen this movie then you should rent it and you will enjoy it, but if you want to enjoy it more rent it and get yourself a fifth of wild turkey while your out... then you can have a great part. P.S. Paul walker is baller, even and especially in this movie. Phil and Stu deedle are two surf bums who end up working at a national park and dealing with a prarie dog infestation. They have to portray themselves as experts in the field so that they can keep their cover, escape from a crazy ex-camp leader and continue to receive free lodging. How does this premise not even make you laugh just by the sound of it? This movie is also awesome because it has insane slang from the ninety's that will crack you up",
         "On their 18th birthday, Hawaii surfer dudes Stew and Phil Deedle skip school. Their wealthy father Elton, informed that the boys will get no more second chances, has to do something. Realizing the boys will someday take over his business, he must see that they are turned into men, so he sends them to a sort of boot camp in Wyoming. A couple of unexpected detours result in the boys ending up unconscious at the entrance to Yellowstone Park, wearing the labelled clothes of Mel and Mo, the park's newest ranger trainees. (Did I mention Mo and Mel are female?) Mel and Mo were hired because of their rodent expertise, because the park has a serious prairie dog problem. This was caused by former head ranger Frank Slater, fired after an incident several years ago and now out for revenge, along with his associates Crabbe and Nemo. Stew and Phil don't bother to correct Capt. Pine, the current head ranger, when he believes they are who the clothes say they are. They see an opportunity to satisfy their father in a way that lets them have a good time. Mel and Mo, meanwhile, are otherwise occupied. The big event coming up, which Slater wants to sabotage, is the billionth birthday of Old Faithful. Another reason the boys want to stay at Yellowstone--Lt. Jesse Ryan, another ranger who is the stepdaughter of Capt. Pine, who declares her off limits. That doesn't stop the boys from trying. I don't understand how Disney could be associated with such garbage. For one thing, there was too much off-color humor for my taste. But I enjoyed this mess overall. There was plenty of slapstick comedy, especially the constant misfortunes of poor Capt. Pine, and Slater's brainless sidekicks. And we were taken on several exciting thrill rides, especially in the sequences immediately preceding the boys' arrival at the park. Another thrilling sequence involved surfboards (In Wyoming? Yes). Steve Van Wormer and Paul Walker had their good moments, reminding me a lot of the superior Bill and Ted movies. So did A.J. Langer and Robert Englund. But one doesn't watch movies such as this for good acting. And there wasn't much. I'm surprised a respected actor such as Dennis Hopper would get involved with something like this. He really didn't add that much. John Ashton also didn't make me as happy as he could have. And despite talent he has shown over the years on \"The Young and the Restless\", Eric Braeden fell flat in his brief appearances as the boys' father. As mindless enjoyable entertainment, though, this film succeeded. I can say I had a good time."
