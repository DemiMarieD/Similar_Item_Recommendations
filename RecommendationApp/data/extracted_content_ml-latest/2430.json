Many of the team from King Kong reteam to make this film, and undoubtedly it's pretty much the same plotting only with a different resolution.\r\n\r\nHowever, the effects work is still magical, harking back to a time when geniuses like Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen sweated buckets to make the magic move on the screen. Mighty Joe, the huge Gorilla of the title, is beautifully realised, full of expressions and emotions, he even has time for some sense of humour traits.\r\n\r\nAction is never far away, with models and sets destroyed with brute force, while plenty of beings get flung about to emphasise the madness of it all. Narratively like Kong there's still themes of greed and ignorance, the tampering with Mother Nature a big mistake, which all leads to a thrilling finale that in turn leads to something to savour.\r\n\r\nKiddie Kong? Who cares! A wonderful film of skill and guile, of charm and brains. Go Joe Go! 8/10",

      "synopsis": "Seven-year-old Jill Young is a lonely little girl living on her fathers farm in Africa. One day she barters for a pet/friend: a baby gorilla carried by two African natives. Twelve years later, a New York nightclub entrepreneur, Max OHara, plans to open an African-themed nightclub in Hollywood. Gregg Johnson, a champion roper from Oklahoma, whose rodeo just closed locally, visits to ask to go to Africa with OHara, who agrees, having come up with the idea of having the cowboy lasso lions. In Africa, OHaras encampment is close to the Young farm. The gorilla, now grown, sees the strangers, who decide to rope him (although the local agent, Crawford, tells them You cant rope a gorilla!) A wild-and-wooly Western style scene ensues, with cowboys and horses converging on Joe, who breaks the ropes like wet mop strings! He captures OHara just as Jill, now nineteen, shows up. OHara recovers in time to see Jill command and Joe obeyand OHara is stunned. He tracks Jill down and convinces her to come to Hollywood with Joe to star in his nightclub, commanding Joe as Jill the Jungle Queen. As OHara predicted, the opening night is a resounding success. The opening act consists of Jill playing Beautiful DreamerJoes favorite tuneon a fancy grand piano, while Joe lifts a platform holding Jill, piano, and all! His next strong-ape feat is a tug-of-war with ten real-life strongmen, including Killer Karl Davis, Man Mountain Dean, the Swedish Angel, and ex-boxer Primo Carnera, whom Joe throws into the audience! But the novelty wears off. Joe must live in a somber gray cage in the basement. He loses his appetite; so does Jill. Ten weeks follow; Jill cries on Greggs shoulder (It seems like ten years!) She decides to quit; OHara talks her out of it. Seven more weeks pass. An organ-grinder act turns out to be a bad idea. Three drunks sneak backstage and ply Joe with liquor; one (Nestor Paiva) also touches a lighted cigarette to Joes bare skin and Joe loses control, and wrecks the place. A court orders him shot. OHara cooks up a plan, and the remainder of the movie is a thrilling chase scene beginning when OHara plays sick so the guard has to leave his post, allowing Jill to free Joe. They sneak him into a moving van, and almost get away when a transient worker/tramp sees Joe in the van. He tells this at the police station, and the cops are almost on the vans heels when they transfer Joe to a truck. OHara delays the police in the van. The truck continues, and, in the climax, approaches a burning orphanage. Jill and Greggusing his roping expertiserescue two more children hiding in a closet inside. Last of all, Joe himself climbs a tree to rescue a little girl trapped on a parapet, and when the tree he clings to burns he falls with it almost to the ground. Jill approaches the exhausted, bruised Joe, and an unidentified male voice assures her, Nobody in the world is gonna shoot Joe now! The epilog shows OHara back in New York, months later. Windy shows him a film the agent, Crawford, took of Gregg and Jilland Joe. OHara says, Theyre back in Africa where they belong. Goodbye from Joe Young. dougm90248@aol.com",

         "Great film about an oversize gorilla (about 10-11 feet), its owner (Terry Moore) and what happens when an unscrupulous promoter Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) lures them from Africa to America to become a hit. Let's get the bad stuff out of the way--the story is nothing new; Terry Moore and Ben Johnson are among the worst actors I've ever seen and there's zero lack of characterization among the humans. But when Joe Young appears all is forgiven. He looks great, moves realistically and has incredible facial motions. You can tell exactly what he's thinking by his expressions! Also, the scenes where he's grappling with humans, horses, lions look extremely realistic--that's saying a lot for a film that's over 50 years old! A fun family film. Try to see restored prints--there's a final sequence involving a burning building in which the whole reel is tinted red--very nicely done.",
         "I remember seeing Mighty Joe Young before I ever saw King Kong, and for the longest time I preferred it to Kong because it seemed newer, with better effects, and more familiar actors, while Kong seemed older and a little creakier with a less familiar cast of characters. Over the years I've come to appreciate both as great movies, the same basic story or premise, but with a slightly different spin, one as a grand thrilling epic, and one as a heartwarming story with laughs and thrills. Where Kong is the tragic violent figure meeting his fate for the love of a woman, Joe Young is a warm cuddly teddy bear of a creature trying to stave off that wild beast that lives inside of him for the affection of a woman. Where Kong wouldn't expend a drop of sweat helping a human, except for Ann Darrow, Joe Young appears more than human in that he would sacrifice himself to save the children and adults in an orphanage engulfed in flames. And although Robert Armstrong doesn't play the same character in both movies, just the same type of character, it's kind of nice to see him learn from his mistakes in the previous film and early on in this one so that he can make a determined effort to have this story end differently. While King Kong may have been a grand slam out of the park, Mighty Joe Young still comes out as a solid home run.",
         "Of all the great ape films, this one made by the same folks that brought us King Kong and Son of Kong has to be the most charming. The story is simple enough about a young girl that raises a gorilla from infancy in the wilds of Africa to be wooed and wowed by an American showman looking for acts in Africa. The showman sees her gorilla and the way she can make it listen and do tricks...and soon both beast and beauty are off to the US to star in a night club act of all things. Terry Moore is a real cutie portraying the girl. The showman is played by...well who else but the same man responsible for bringing King Kong to New York City 16 years earlier...Robert Armstrong. The rest of the cast is adequate with Nestor Paiva in a small but crucial role standing out. The real star, however, is the ape itself and the special effects centered around it. This gorilla is brutish yet humane. He is playful and yet serious and somber at times. Willis O'Brien has done it again with the effects and his stop motion animation, with a great deal of improvement since Kong. The best thing about this movie is its heart, and the heart shown between the young girl and her pet/child. Some scenes are very striking in the film. One that stands out the most is the introduction of Mighty Joe Young in the night club with Terry Moore playing the piano. It looks like Busby Berkley choreographed it. Another very powerful scene involves Joe with an orphanage on fire. The scene is tremendous and even tinted red. Very impressive for its release. A True Classic!",
         "A wonderfully entertaining slant on \"King Kong\" by Kong's creators, Cooper and Schoedsack (along with John Ford). Much better than Kong's 1934 sequel, \"Son of Kong\", which was hurriedly made. The creators put a lot of thought and effort into this worthy follow-up and it shows. More superb special effects from Willis O'Brien as technical director, featuring the budding talents of protege, Ray Harryhausen.",
         "\"Mighty Joe Young\" was a very entertaining film with a surprising amount of action. In fact, the last third to last half of this film is just about non-stop. it reminded me of King Kong, of course with a big age being brought to New York City for display and then things going haywire. This movie, however, has a happier ending than \"Kong,\" although it doesn't look like that will be the case near the end. It turns to be a very suspenseful movie in that last 30 minutes, especially. Even though this was an early Ray Harryhausen special-effects effort (and he's interviewed in two features on the DVD), it still looks pretty hokey in spots. But in 1949, this must have been pretty cool. Hey, to be fair, some parts are decently realistic if you aren't too critical. One thing: they are fun to watch! The only weak point was the acting. A very young-looking Ben Johnson sounded wooden and Robert Armstrong overacted. Terry Moore, as Mighty Joe's guardian, so to speak, was so-so. What made this movie better-than-average was the injection of some humor into this adventure story. Humor, and a bit of sentimentality as Mighty Joe is humanized to a degree. The big ape was funny while sitting in the back of a speeding truck eluding the police, and at the very of the movie he made most viewers laugh. This movie is much better now that it's on DVD. The transfer is excellent; a nice picture. Near the end, with the big orphanage fire, the black-and-white scenes are tinted. Overall, if you liked the 1933 version of King Kong, you'll like this. A lot of the same people were responsible for both films. This is pure entertainment, which is why I gave it '9' stars.",
         "Thanksgiving just can't be Thanksgiving without Mighty Joe Young. From as far back as I can remember, until about 10 years ago, WOR, channel 9 in New York City, played a King Kong festival on Thanksgiving day, and then a Godzilla festival on Friday, dubbing it \"Monster Weekend.\" Of the 3 \"ape movies\" played back-to-back (King Kong, Son of Kong, and Mighty Joe Young), this was far and away the best. There were several reasons for it. (1) Mighty Joe Young has the best special effects of all the ape movies (and, truth be known, far better than those of most of the Godzillas -- which were filmed 10-20 years later!). (2) Mighty Joe Young has the best story. It's about a little girl who adopts a young gorilla in Africa on her family's plantation, and she grows up with it. The gorilla turns out to be the largest in the world (but nowhere near the size of Kong). Joe is affectionate with his \"sister\", and very protective of her, and the animators gave him a wonderful range of facial expressions and emotions. (3) Mighty Joe Young has the best climax, and the best ending. All told, Mighty Joe Young is a terriffic movie. It was light years ahead of its time in so many ways, including special effects. It is well worth the time to see it. My score: 8/10",
         "In Africa, the girl Jill Young trades a baby gorilla with two natives and raises the animal. Twelve years later, the talkative and persuasive promoter Max O'Hara (Robert Armstrong) organizes a safari to Africa with the Oklahoma cowboy Gregg (Ben Johnson) to bring attractions to his new night-club in Hollywood. They capture several lions and out of blue, they see a huge gorilla nearby their camping and they try to capture the animal. However, the teenager Jill Young (Terry Moore) stops the men that intended to kill her gorilla. Max seduces Jill with a fancy life in Hollywood and she signs a contract with him where the gorilla Joseph \"Joe\" Young would be the lead attraction. Soon she realizes that her dream is a nightmare to Joe and she asks Max to return to Africa. However he persuades her to stay a little longer in the show business. But when three alcoholic costumers give booze to Joe, the gorilla destroys the spot and is sentenced by the justice to be sacrificed. Will Jill, Gregg and Max succeed in saving Joe? \"Mighty Joe Young\" is a surprisingly excellent movie, with a story that entwines drama, romance and adventure and with awesome special effects for a 1949 movie. I bought this DVD a couple of years ago, but I was expecting a lame rip-off of King Kong based on the awful Brazilian title. However, the plot is engaging, with lots of emotions and many plot points and Joe's runaway is spectacular. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"Monstro de um Mundo Perdido\" (\"Monster of a Lost World\")",
         "When many people bring this film up, many of them want to compare it to its predecessor King Kong. However, if they would let this film stand on its own they would see that this is a good film about a young girl and her pet gorilla. Joe is almost childlike and is even lovable. Also, the human cast is fine especially Terry Moore and Robert Armstrong in what pretty much is a repeat of his role of impresario Carl Denham in the original Kong. But, lets not forget the special effects. Willis O'Brien and his protégé, a young Ray Harryhausen do a remarkable job with Joe. The pretty much show him as being a more rounded character than Kong and you can see the aforementioned childlike qualities they bring to him. This is definitely a great film.",
         "When this first came out, I saw it on the Silver Screen. It's been described before, and the closest thing to a really nasty person are the cops who want to dispose of Joe. This is an MGM film: Misunderstood Gorilla Movie. As presented to the audience, he's neither a menace nor a bad sort. Possible minor spoiler: The introduction of Joe in the nightclub was a memorable scene. The girl plays Joe's favorite song at the piano on a stage, and as the song continues, the piano and stage rise smoothly until they reach a significant height, and then the lights come up: Joe is holding up girl, piano, and stage. This is one of my favorite scenes in the film.",
         "If Hollywood must makes remakes due to the mostly lack of creativity that we see these days coming out of Tinsel Town, then at least make the remake better. This original story of a Girl and Her Ape is so much better, so much better paced and without the hideous mean spirited additions the new one had added. The very fact that this first version was done with stop motion photography gives it an edge over the computer generated swill we saw in color just a few years back. Sure there are some 1940ish hokey \"B\" movie formula stuff, but in the end-the 1949 film is just so much better paced and more palatable for the younger set. If you have not seen this one, give it a shot. If you prefer the newer version then you obviously have a thing against the black and white films of yore. MM"

         "In Africa, the girl Jill Young trades a baby gorilla with two natives and raises the animal. Twelve years later, the talkative and persuasive promoter Max O'Hara organizes a safari to Africa with the Oklahoma cowboy Gregg to bring attractions to his new night-club in Hollywood. They capture several lions and out of blue, they see a huge gorilla nearby their camping and they try to capture the animal. However, the teenager Jill Young stops the men that intended to kill her gorilla. Max seduces Jill with a fancy life in Hollywood and she signs a contract with him where the gorilla Joseph \"Joe\" Young would be the lead attraction. Soon she realizes that her dream is a nightmare to Joe and she asks Max to return to Africa. However he persuades her to stay a little longer in the show business. But when three alcoholic costumers give booze to Joe, the gorilla destroys the spot and is sentenced by the justice to be sacrificed. Will Jill, Gregg and Max succeed in saving Joe?",
         "Jill Young has brought up her pet gorilla since she was a child. Twelve years later, when the gorilla is fully grown, Hollywood promoter Max O'Hara travels to Tanzania, Africa, and convinces Jill to bring her extraordinarily large gorilla, Joe, back to America. While in Hollywood, Joe is used in a stage production and is exploited to no end. It doesn't take long until Joe is sick of being mistreated and he escapes to run loose in civilization."

This fun and wonderfully entertaining slant on \"King Kong\" is much better than Kong's 1934 sequel, \"Son of Kong\". This all ages adventure has superb special effects from Willis O'Brien and his protege, Ray Harryhausen.",
