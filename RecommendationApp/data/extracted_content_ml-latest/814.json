         "Scott Caan, the young son of James Caan, stars here in the title role, a teenage delinquent released from jail. Hate, after being released the same day, commits a crime, where he leaves a man for dead after he finds him attempting to rape a girl (Missy Crider). The two hit the road, in the usual, cynical way most films take it. Crider is not a good actress, and her performance does little for her typically bitter, depressed, hard-to-get-into-yet-lovable-as-time-goes-by chick. Although at first Caan seemed like a cocky wannabe actor, but as the movie rolls along, he shows great depth (and the scenes between him and \"Smoke Signals\"'s Adam Beach, as an Indian, are the best of the film. Those two generate more chemistry than twenty times that of Caan and Crider.) Fair road flick with a few highlights, but overall, nothing special. Two and a Half stars out of Four.",
         "I have to agree with the fact that the acting in this movie was not as good as it could have been, but it is a great movie of teen angst without being completely watered down and Hollywoodized like teen films of today are. This movie definitely ranks up there with Pump Up the Volume or Heathers(I am in fact, NOT, obsessed with Christian Slater. Those movies are just awesome.). Scott Caan shows great skill in this movie and proves that he is as good an actor as his father. It's a shame this movie is not available on DVD and I wonder if it ever will be... If Summer Catch is $5.50 at Target, this movie should surely be there.",
         "The main problem with 'A Boy Called Hate' is the lousy script. This film does nothing new and displays such limited character development that it is impossible to amount any sympathy for its cliched characters. As a result I was left wondering if the film had any point at all..."
