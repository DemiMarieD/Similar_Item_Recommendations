Laraine Newman and Jane Curtin were very underrated as comediennes, and the unsung heroes that held the cast together during its excellent run of the early days.\r\n\r\nWhat's hardly ever talked about, when it comes to movies based on SNL skits, is how important the supporting players are. 'Coneheads' undoubtedly has the strongest supporting cast of any of them, and while director Barron has hardly become a household name in terms of movies (only this and 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' really hit the radar), his prowess on some of the greatest music videos of all time (ie., Dire Straits' 'Money for Nothing', Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean' and A-Ha's 'Take On Me') was picture-perfect for the comedic set-pieces here. Definitely worth at least a watch, here in the 21st-century.",

            "content": "Fun shenanigans with the Coneheads on Earth and Remulak.\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1993 and directed by Steve Barron, \"Coneheads\" chronicles events when a couple from the planet Remulak, Beldar (Dan Aykroyd) and Prymatt (Jane Curtin), are mistakenly ditched on Earth, during a reconnaissance mission for planet takeover. Their misadventures include: Dodging the INS (Michael McKean & David Spade), moving to suburbia and having a kid (Michelle Burke) and meeting all kinds of colorful people (Sinbad, Jason Alexander, Chris Farley, etc.). In other words, there\u2019s a constant string of guest stars that were popular at the time, mostly comedians. \r\n\r\nI had my doubts about this movie because I didn\u2019t think they could take an amusing 9-minute SNL skit and effectively make it into a film ten times longer. But the flick\u2019s funny from the get-go and the writers wisely change settings & peripheral characters so regularly that the story never gets dull. \r\n\r\nOn the female front there\u2019s Lisa Jane Persky as a voluptuously winsome neighbor and the mind-blowing Michelle Burke as the Conehead daughter, Connie (a role that Laraine Newman fulfilled on TV, but she was considered too old for the role in the film at 40). The creators wisely showcase Burke\u2019s beauty without resorting to tasteless sleaze. The third act features a well-done sequence on the Conehead homeworld, Remulak.\r\n\r\nCritics may have hated it, but \u201cConeheads\u201d competently entertains and amuses on several levels.     \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 28 minutes and was shot in New York City; Paramus, New Jersey; and Cerritos, California.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: B",

         "Coneheads is one of the best \"Saturday Night Live\" movies. I was expecting a light comedy but what I got was a whole lot more. Following a similar plot to the skit, Coneheads is the story about the Beldar Conehead family who crash on earth during a scouting mission for planet conquest. While here, they dodge the INS, have a child and discover that life on Earth is quite good. This is where the movie shows its heart. It could have been a movie of comedy bits but by the end, it is about happiness in a stable family, which is quite refreshing in these days of depressing movies about divorces and unmarried couples. It is nice to see Beldar be a father figure to his daughter rather than the \"Let Your Kids Be Who They Are\" mentality of these days. The direction of the film in excellent, setting up many nice visual gags and shots that are very impressive for a comedy film. And at times, the film feels \"epic\" as you see the family on the run from the INS, to moving to the suburbs to returning to their planet. There are great performances throughout the film and the many cameos are perfect. Look for funny scenes from Jan Hooks, Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, and Garrett Morris. Michelle Burke makes a nice debut as Connie Conehead and I expect to see more of her in the future. On the surface, this seems like a dumb movie and it has received many poor reviews. But if you sit back and let it take you on an adventure (and if you can keep up with the way the Coneheads use different words for common items) you will be pleasantly surprised.",
         "Remember back in the early 90's where Paramount released unforgettable comedies and they just wouldn't stop? Coneheads came out and for some weird reason that is beyond me got a bad rep, I know that this was a sillier movie and not the strongest to come out of the vaults of Saturday Night Live with it's goofy characters. But the film in my opinion worked because it had Dan Aykroyd writing the film as well as starring in it. Honestly, how could you not laugh at this movie? If you're telling me that you did not laugh one time during this movie, there is something wrong with you, check your funny bone because this movie has a great cast who looked like they just had a blast making Coneheads. Beldar Conehead and his wife Prymaat Conehead as they try to assimilate into American society and pursue the immigrant's American dream. Their spacecraft was part of an advance scouting mission for an invasion, but was shot down by a F-16 fighter-interceptor, stranding them on Earth. They live with secret identities while an INS agent tracks them incessantly over the years. They Conehead family blend into Paramus, New Jersey and take up activities that are part and parcel of the American Dream. They also raise their teenage daughter, Connie, who has recently begun dating. As they continue to wait for their mother ship, they live the American dream where they are respected and upstanding citizens. I know this is silly but I can't help but laugh at the way the coneheads talk to each other, especially when Beldar gets his \"citizen\" name Donald R. DeCicco, the way he says DeCicco is just too funny. I'm not a huge Chris Farely fan, but he is so hilarious and charming in this movie as Ronnie who takes a liking to Beldar's daughter. When he starts to get a little touchy feely with her and she tells her parents about it, Beldar rips the roof of Ronnie's car like a can opener saying in his own alien way that he will kill Ronnie if he tires anything again and Ronnie being confused by the way Beldar said it said back \"Uh, thank you?\". The movie may be silly, but when have we let being silly get in the way of us having a good time? If something makes you laugh, don't fight it. I think this was a fun comedy that is a treasure in my DVD collection. Trust me, just let go and have a good time, I'm sure you'll get at least one laugh from this wonderful comedy. 7/10",
         "Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin reprise their roles from Saturday Night Live on to the big screen. The film is filled with countless classic cameos that really make this film. Jason Alexander as the follically challenged neighbor and Chris Farley as Connie Conehead's boyfriend are especially hilarious. I really wondered if you could pull off a feature film from basically a 5 minute TV skit...but the script is so well written with so many funny jokes...David Spade is another who delivers line after line as the smarmy kiss butt assistant to Michael McKean's character. But its the talent of Aykroyd and Curtin, two comedy veterans who really drive this one home. Laughs all around, I loved it!",
         "The fact that this is a good film AND it was done by ex-SNL actors help this movie to really stand out for me. Dan Aykroyd is terrific as Beldar and it shows that he CAN do a decent film (and he's done some stinkers--Neighbors, 1941, Nothing But Trouble, Dr. Detroit). As I said above, I haven't been that impressed by many of the films by ex-SNL cast members--especially when they are movie-length versions of SNL skits. However, this movie expands on the characters and has great heart. In other words, despite the humor, the lead characters come off as sympathetic and decent. If the characters had been just like they were in the skits, the movie would have fallen flat on its face. Instead, we are treated to many instances when the Coneheads try so hard to fit in and be the average American family. It's also quite amusing that almost no one seems to notice that they AREN'T! There are many SNL-related cameos and supporting players throughout the movie and they are pretty well integrated (i.e., they usually don't seem like tacked on cameos but fit within the plot). Also, although I generally hate David Spade, his annoying personality fits in perfectly with the character he plays. This is a good film for the whole family. It's cute, funny and actually has amazingly good family values!",
         "Other than WAYNE'S WORLD, this is the only film adaptation of an SNL skit that really worked for me. CONEHEADS was an inventive and smartly written 1993 comedy that expanded upon the original Saturday Night Live skits starring Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, and Lorraine Newman as Beldar, Prymatt, and Connie Conehead, the aliens who are trying to live as earthlings and tell the world that they are from France. The movie starts before Connie is even born, showing why Beldar and Prymatt were sent to earth and how they ended up smack in the middle of suburbia. There are some moments of genuine warmth that you feel for the Coneheads as they have to stay on the run, as they are being pursued by a slimy Immigration agent (Michael McKean, in an on target performance) and his ass-kissing assistant (a hysterical David Spade). The film has one hilarious moment after another. Jan Hooks appears as a student of Beldar (who is seen working briefly as a driving instructor)who lusts after Beldar and her silent encounter with Prymatt in a supermarket is hysterical. Chris Farley is very funny as Ronnie, Connie's boyfriend. The role of Connie has been inherited by Michelle Burke for some reason, though Lorraine Newman can be spotted in a cameo near the end of the film. Jason Alexander and Lisa Jane Persky are very funny as Beldar and Prymatt's suburban neighbors. Sinbad has some funny moments as Beldar's first boss and Adam Sandler is funny in a brief scene as a guy who provides Beldar with a phony Social Security card and whole new identity. There is so much to take in here and a lot of talented comedians are seen to good advantage, whether in starring or cameo roles. CONEHEADS is one of the most underrated comedies of the 90's which I don't think ever got the credit it deserved. If you've never seen it, definitely worth the rental.",
         "I love, love, love Coneheads! This movie has GREAT lines. The perspective of American life from that of an alien is SO funny. Some of my favorite lines...like when Primaat and Beldar invite the neighbors over for \"charred mammal flesh\" or when she reads a magazine and asks Beldar how he'd feel if she passed away (his answer is one that EVERY husband needs to memorize and tell his wife OFTEN!. There are too many to list, and so many that I think are better than what are listed on the page. I love the creativity of the story line. From screaming at the bowling pins and eggplants to rigging the pop machine to get \"silver tender disks\" to pay for the motel room. I've watched it over and over again through the years and each time find a new favorite part! It's a movie that grows on you from the start!",
         "Just like Beldar's homemade fireworks display this movie may not make a lasting impression immediately, but give it a chance. The movie is a really fine piece of work, it's good for a laugh again and again. On top of that most (US) comedy actors worth mentioning are in the movie!",
         "Beldar (Aykroyd) & Prymaat (Curtin) Conehead are two aliens who come from the planet Remulak their ship has crash landed on earth and have no way to return home. Forced to enjoy human society they try to get used to their new surroundings but are soon on the run from immigration officers Seedling (Mckean) & Turnbull (Spade), months later Prymaat gives birth to a beautiful baby girl whom they name Connie . 18 years later Connie (Burke) is pretty young woman who is always at ends with her parental units she falls head over heels in love with Ronnie (Farley) a local mechanic and neighborhood boy who admits to never have dated a girl taller than him before. Coneheads is a great family comedy with tons of laughs from start to finish , Chris Farley 29, & Michelle Burke 23, play the star crossed teenage couple with humor and warmth 8/10 Stars",
         "\"Coneheads\" is the perfect kind of movie to have on killing time late at night, or when you just want to veg and not think about anything. The humor in the movie is simple to understand and easy to laugh at. Adam Sandler's cameo in the movie was great. Sinbad has a cameo too that he turns into many laughs. This movie was fun to watch. Of course there are many jokes about how these people have cones for heads, but that is the title of the movie, so no complaints warranted there. Dan Aykroyd really loves his Beldar character, and it shows here as much as it does in the many Saturday Night Live skits about the Coneheads.",
         "Coneheads was a good SNL movie, the coneheads space ship crashes and they have to adjust to lifestyle on earth. Coneheads has a lot of great SNL names in the cast (Akroyd, Hartman, Sandler, Nealon, and Farley) so I don't know if that is good or bad for this movie you decide, but I enjoyed this movie and I think you will also."
