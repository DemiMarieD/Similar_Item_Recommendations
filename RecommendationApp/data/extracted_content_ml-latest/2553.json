      "synopsis": "After a series of establishing shots of a village in rural England, we switch to a study where Gordon Zelleby (George Sanders) is making arrangements by phone with his brother-in-law, Alan Bernard (Michael Gwynn) to come down for the day. In mid-sentence Gordon collapses to the floor. All through the town people have collapsed or passed out. Cars crash, phones ring unanswered. The local bell tower shows 10 minutes to 11. Alan, who an officer in the British army, reports to his superior that something strange seems to have happened in the village of Midwich, he asks permission to leave early. He wonders if the exercises the 4th Brigade are doing in the area could be responsible. Driving to the town, Berrnard encounters a local police officer Gobby, (Peter Vaughan) who is investigating the non appearance of a scheduled bus from Midwich. Rounding the next bend in the road the find the vehicle crashed in a ditch. Gobby investigates but passes out just like the people in the village. Bernard realizes something is terribly wrong and heads to the previous town to report to his commanding officer. The alarm is immediately raised and local area commanders are ordered to seal off the town and surrounding areas. Unsure what they are dealing with, soldiers are ordered forward carrying caged canaries attached to poles. When the birds pass out, the spot is marked. It is quickly noted the creatures return to life as soon as the cage is retrieved. At the site of the bus crash the army sends a volunteer in to the affected area. He is wearing a gas mask and tethered by rope so that if he collapses he can be pulled to safety. As they begin Dr Willers (Laurence Naismith) the local Midwich doctor arrives on his way back to the town. The soldier collapses as expected and is pulled to safety. Examination by Willers shows no obvious cause, and the man revives under his own power. Other than feeling intensely cold the solider reports he is perfectly fine. The army then sends a plane to overfly the town. The pilot reports nothing unusual other than absolutely nothing is moving in the area. The pilot takes his craft lower only to black out and crash in a nearby field. The military are considering their options when suddenly all the people in the bus and officer Gobby revive. We see images from all over town of people regaining consciousness and trying to understand what happened to them. In his study Gordon wakes as his wife Anthea Zellaby (Barbara Shelley) chides him for letting her sleep so late, she then comments its nearly 3 p.m. Gordon apologies that he also fell asleep, but given he woke on the floor of the study, he may have passed out. Discussing how they feel, the couple agrees they feel intensely cold and Gordon complains he can't feel his hands. Bernard arrives at the house and is pleased to see the couple are okay, he goes on to explain the events of the last four hours and Midwich was surrounded by some barrier that cut it off from the world. Through the rest of the day, military units pour into the town. The local townsfolk are subject to a battery of tests by specialists and the town is examined inch by inch for any unusual readings or signs of activity. Later, Gordon is invited to London by Bernard to take part in a meeting to review what occurred in the town. No direct after affect or cause for the phenomena has been discovered. This leads Gordon to be concerned about how they will identify long term effects if they can't understand the situation that caused it. Bernard suggests Gordon be put in charge of monitoring the towns population. The obvious solution would be to hospitalize them but this would create huge disruptions and potentially alert the press. Later, Anthea announces to Gordon that she is expecting a baby. Gordon is flustered but overjoyed by the news. Although Anthea is young, Gordon married quite late in life and never really expected the opportunity to raise children. At Doctor Willer's office, Milly Hughes (Pamela Buck) is devastated to find out she is also pregnant. Milly is distraught because she is still a virgin. Dr. Willers comforts her, but clearly he does not believe her. Tension is high in another household. Mrs. Pawle has just told her husband she is pregnant even though he's only just returned from a full year at sea. Concerned by the sudden rash of pregnancies, Doctor Willers and Gordon meet with the town vicar (Bernard Archard). An attempted suicide has been reported and the two men want to see what information the vicar might have, especially if any of the girls had confessed to the priest who the father might be. The Vicar has heard nothing from either Mrs Pawle or Milly, but is aware of three further girls who are also expecting. He is deeply troubled that one girl is only 15 years old. . As three men compare the information they have, Dr Willers realizes that every woman of child-bearing age is the town expecting, and that all the pregnancies date from the day of the strange events. Five months later, the pregnancies are going well, too well according to Dr Willers. Each fetus appears to be at the 7th month of development even though the women are only in their fifth month. Anthea becomes depressed over the baby. She wants to know whose baby she is carrying, what sort of monster or strange child she is going to bring into the world. Gordon comforts her with the thought; all they can do is wait. The village becomes pensive and nervous as all the women go into labor at the same time. One of the first born, Anthea's child, is healthy 10-pounder, but the doctor in bothered by the child's strange eyes. We then learn that a total of 12 babies are born, all weighing a touch over 10 pounds and all with strange eyes. Four months later, the doctor examines some hair taken from Gordon's son, David. Aside from their odd fingernails and strange eyes, the children seem perfectly normal except that they have the developmental level of 18-month-old children. Upstairs in the Zellaby nursery a commotion breaks out. Anthea is in a state of panic and puts her hand in a pot of boiling water, burning it badly. It seems she forgot to test the child's milk and it was too hot for him. A year passes. David, now a toddler, spells out his name with blocks. As a test, Gordon then gives him a Chinese box puzzle. He works through the puzzle and opens it with alarming speed. Gordon then goes to a neighbor's home and tests their child; it opens the device without hesitation. A third child is tested but his older brother steals the puzzle. The child's eyes light with a strange glow, and the older boy falls into a trance and meekly returns the stolen puzzle. Years pass, and the children become inseparable and deal with the taunting from other children as a combined group. It is now becoming apparent that they can read minds. It is three years since the children were born, and Gordon is summoned to London for a special conference to discuss the children. Alan is becoming disturbed at Gordon's intellectual detachment from the issue of the strange behavior of the children. Gordon believes (unlike others in the village) that the children are not evil or bad, but just need to have morals instilled in them. In London, it is revealed that Midwich was not the only town that has experienced this phenomenon. In Australia, something went wrong and all the children died within 10 hours of birth. In Greenland and Mongolia, the children were killed at birth by frightened members of the community. One other group, born in the Soviet Union, is thriving and receiving the best of educations. Present at the meeting, Dr Carile suggests that the children may be a naturally occurring evolutionary jump. Others such as Professor Smith disagree and believe the children may be the product of an energy beam directed to Earth by some unknown intelligence. News comes through that a child has drowned in Midwich after having an altercation with the strange children, and they are being blamed for the event. George continues to defend them, arguing they need studying. They seem connected by a hive mind, and if humanity could control that, it was advance intelligence by a factor of 12. To keep better control of the children, Zellaby suggests that they be kept together under one roof at Midwich's school. He offers to run the project and continue studying them for another 12 months while the government decides the best course of actions. Back in Midwich, Zellaby begins teaching the children. They now openingly admit that they can read thoughts at the front of his mind, but have not mastered the complete understanding of everything he is thinking. Deciding to test Dr Smith's theory, he asks the children about life on other planets. The children go into a communal trance and refuse to answer Gordon's question. He rephrases the question but the children still refuse to answer. Gordon then asks David what he intends to do with the powers the children are developing. David tells Gordon he knows what Gordon is really trying to find out and it would be better if these types of questions were not asked. David says they are here to learn from him. Later, Mrs Zellaby witnesses one of the special girls nearly killed by a car. The driver jumps out, fretting that he may have hurt the girl. Some of the other special children who witnessed the incident begin to gather around the driver. The man seems to slip into a trance, returns to his car and drives it without hesitation into a wall, being killed on impact. At an inquest into the accident, Mrs Zellaby is called as a witness. Her testimony is confused and lacking detail, as if she is trying to remember something but can't. Ultimately they court records a verdict of accidental death. On a country road, the brother of the man killed tries to ambush the children. Gordon talks him out of the attempt, but before he can leave he is spotted by the children. They put him into the same trance his brother fell into and fatally shoots himself with his own gun. Zellaby now understands how deep the situation is. He'd hoped to communicate with them, but clearly the process is breaking down. He realizes they need to somehow be stopped before they expand their power beyond the village. Zellaby and Bernard are discussing the best course of action when news comes through from Russia. The other surviving colony has been destroyed by an atomic shell fired from 60 miles away. The entire population, including the children, has been killed. Back at Midwich, the panicked villagers decide they need to do something about the children. The men form a mob and, armed with farm implements and flaming torches, advance on the school house with the intention of burning it down and trapping the children inside. David goes outside to confront the advancing villagers. David then puts the man in a tell take trance and forces him to set fire to himself, only releasing him from his control when the man is close to death. Bernard witnesses the failed attack and enters the school to confront David, who is aware of the Russian colony's fate. David warns Bernard that an attack on this colony won't succeed. When Bernard asks why, the boy responds, \"This group MUST survive.\" David then takes control of Bernard and reinforces a message that the children just want to be left alone; they drive that into him before releasing him. Later, Bernard is examined by Dr Willers who believes Bernard is suffering the worst case of shock he's ever seen. David arrives at the house and confronts his father. He tells the man the children have decided to leave the village and spread out across the country. Their power has reached a point where each child can found a new colony. David then outlines a series of travel arrangements he wants Gordon to organize to help the children disperse. Gordon comes up with a plan to get through to the children; sensing Anthea's fear, he arranges for her to travel back to London with Alan. As Alan says goodbye, Gordon seems very introspective and on the verge of crying. Now alone in the house, we understand Gordon's emotions. He is building a bomb he hopes will destroy the children if he can keep his mind blank enough to avoid detetection. He begins to practice imagining a brick wall in his mind to help build a mental barrier that the children can't penetrate. On the drive to London, Anthea realizes something is wrong, and insists on returning to Midwich to try and stop Gordon from doing whatever he's planned. Gordon arrives at the school, and David senses immediately that he is nervous and ill at ease. The children try to break down his mental defense of the brick wall. Gordon holds out long enough to avoid any chance of the children escaping. At the last second, Gordon's mind collapses and the children realize he's been hiding a bomb. Anthea arrives at the school just as an explosion rips through the building. She immediately understands the implications of Gordon's sacrifice in killing the children and himself.

         "On a perfectly normal, lovely afternoon in the English countryside, a small town is suddenly taken over by an unseen presence. Everyone within the town - man, woman and child - suddenly passes out cold for no apparent reason whatsoever. Anyone who attempts to enter the town from the outside is also stricken down, yet revive instantaneously when removed from the danger zone. No one, not police or military, can pass the invisible barrier, but within a few hours the strange presence is gone. Everyone seems to be alright...until a few weeks later, when all of the women in town who are of childbearing age discover themselves to be pregnant. Nine months later, a dozen identical children are born to these somewhat suspicious mothers, children with white- blond hair and scary eyes that glow. The children are oddly emotionless and only associate with each other, acting as a single entity. Worst of all, they can make anyone do whatever they want them to do, which often has fatal results. Can kindly schoolteacher (the wonderful George Sanders), whose beloved wife has borne one of these creatures, help the alien children embrace their human half? Or will he have to destroy them all? This is an absolute masterpiece of paranoia, sci-fi style. The acting is superb, especially by the late and under-appreciated Mr. Sanders, whose compassion and intellect sets the tone for this quiet and somewhat sad little tale. The lovely Barbara Shelley as Sanders loving wife is sweet and totally believable. Indeed, the townsfolk are all very realistic and approachable, kind and simple folk who don't really deserve the wrath of the spooky children who have invaded their small town. Young Martin Stephens, who also turned in a creepy performance in the ghostly masterpiece \"The Innocents\" is every bit as creepy here as George and Barbara's \"son.\" Filmed in moody black and white, this movie creeps along with all the menacing stealth of a thick London pea souper. This is an intelligent horror film which deserves better attention. It probably won't be appreciated by people who consider expletives and explosions to be main characters, but for people who prefer horror with brains (and not brains ripped out of skulls) this is the film for them. Fans of George Sanders shouldn't miss this; it's quite a switch from his usual smarmy roles, and a nice switch at that. Highly recommended!",
         "Village of the Damned is a strongly compelling Science-Fiction highlight and easily of the eeriest movies I ever saw. Although it's a very modest and simply made production, the scary-effect of this film is a lot more effective than some of its big-budgeted colleagues. On a random day, the entire English village of Midwich falls into a trance-like sleep. Completely inexplicably, they awake again seemly normal but two months later it appears that every fertile woman in town got pregnant on the day of the blackout. The newborns show a strange resemblance in looks and \u0096 what is even more bizarre \u0096 they're telekinetic! Due to their amazing intelligence and emotionless behavior, they form a huge threat and freak out the entire little town. `Village of the Damned' is loyally adapted from John Wyndham's novel `The Midwich Cuckoos'. Throughout the whole film, you don't get much explanation and, as a viewer, you're forced to guess at the mystery's origin. Although highly unlikely, the events in Midwich really are alarming and make you feel uncomfortable. This effect is reached through solid tension and macabre atmosphere much more than through special effects. The eerily lit eyes of the \u0091children' are the only real effects but they cause a lot more fear than gallons of blood ever could! Village of the Damned also owes a lot of its power to a terrific casting job. Essentially to achieve the obtained scary effect were the children. Well, they did a good job! The offspring looks alienated almost naturally and their appearance literally chills your blood. The concerned adult in Village of the Damned is excellently played by George Sanders. Sanders was a terrific and shamefully overlooked English class actor who committed suicide in the early 70's. He has a got a few other delightful horror movies on his repertoire like `Psychomania' and `Doomwatch' (both are some of his last films). Village of the Damned is a highly recommended picture that'll certainly keep you close to the screen till the end-credits role. Equally recommended is the (unofficial) sequel called `Children of the Damned'. There's a bit more background in that film, as well as some more explicit horror sequences. The 1995 remake by John Carpenter, however, is rather unexciting and one of the most redundant films ever made. Stick to the original and be scared!",
         "This classic low budget, black and white film is right up there with the best of the sci-fi/horror movies of the time. It appears that it was shot on a very low budget ($300,000), thus no special effects beyond the superimposed glowing eyes of the children and the burning house at the end (not much of an effect). But it became a real moneymaker and a cult developed around it. They went on to make a sequel which doesn't live up to the original. The cast, though limited, is quite good. The ever sophisticated, urbane, George Sanders as the scientist; Barbara Shelley from Hammer films as his wife; and little Martin Stephens as David, putative offspring of Shelley and Sanders. This kid is evil personified and does a bang-up job for such a youngster. The story involves the village of Midwich and the birth of 12 children fathered in a very strange way that is never totally explained, who are intellectual giants with one purpose.....take over the world. Should they be destroyed or studied?....that's the problem facing Sanders and the government. Sanders comes to the inevitable conclusion and because they can read his thoughts, he must think of a brick wall in order to mask his intent. The ending, although not surprising is still effective. This film is a keeper and is recommended to all those who like their films straight to the point without all the special effects and computer generated action. It's minimal with maximum punch.",
         "I am giving this film a 10 based on the \"bang for the buck\" it provides. Despite having a small budget, few special effects and an unknown cast (aside from George Sanders), it is an engrossing and terrifying sci-fi adventure. The movie begins with a VERY STRANGE occurrence--a small village just STOPS. All people life within the village stops--machinery, animals and people. And, when the military tries to enter the town, the soldiers just STOP as well--falling into comas. Then, just as suddenly, everyone awakens--none the worse for wear. Or so it would seem, for later, many women in this small hamlet are found to be pregnant! Once these little bundles of joy are born, the fun begins as these brilliant but disturbingly freaky kids slowly scare the crap out of everyone--especially as they walk, talk and look alike and speak as one (sort of like an evil version of Huey, Dewey and Louie)! And, it turns out, they are apparently unstoppable and up to some sort of evil (though exactly what they intend is uncertain--but it MUST be bad considering their evil proclivities)! NOTE: Do NOT see the supposed sequel, \"Children of the Damned\". It's terrible. Instead of the kids harassing people (such as making them crash their cars into walls or blow their heads off), the kids are misunderstood and only want to live in peace!! What crap--I want murder and global domination! Another NOTE: Do NOT see the recent remake of Village of the Damned. It lacks the subtlety of the original and just does NOTHING to improve an already great film.",
         "I originally saw this when I was in junior high on late night TV. Those glowing eyes gave me nightmares for weeks! Seeing it now MANY years later, it still scares me. It's very quiet but very spooky. No real on-screen violence, no special effects (with the exception of the eyes) and all talk but never dull. The film is intelligent, doesn't talk down to the audience and handles the subject matter in a very realistic manner. Most people in horror films act like idiots--not in this one! Also some superb acting by George Sanders, Barbara Shelley (as his wife) and those creepy little kids (especially Martin Stephens) helps a lot. Proves a quiet little, goreless film can scare you silly. AT ALL COSTS, AVOID THE 1995 REMAKE!!!!!!! Carpenter's a great director, but you can't remake a great film. See this one!!",
         "Village of the Damned is a very well-made thriller that seems to have been overlooked because of the sheer magnitude of its competition - Psycho. Both of these films are testaments to the idea that low budgets are very capable of producing great films. It is not the size of the budget that matters, it is the skill of the filmmakers and the actors. Village of the Damned makes use of a variety of very easily done but also very effective special effects, such as the boundary across which all people and animals lose consciousness, the creepy eyes on those kids, and their hypnotic powers. The discussion of the exact same phenomenon happening to a few remote towns all over the world does a lot to show what these kids can do, and it increases the dramatic tension of the film as a whole. Cheaply made, but also very well made because a lot of thought was obviously put into it, Village of the Damned is a timeless thriller, even in black and white. When you watch a movie like this, if you are the kind of person who is so superficial about your movies that you refuse to watch black and white films, keep in mind that black and white photography REQUIRES good acting, to put it in the immortal words of Orson Welles. You can't have black and white photography and bad acting, the film would never work. Village of the Damned takes black and white photography and fills it with excellent acting, a fascinating story, and good direction that makes me wonder why this was the only film that Wolf Rilla ever directed.",
         "The best way to watch this movie is ignorantly. Go to Netflix now, put the movie at the top of your queue and watch it when it arrives. Read about it later. If you enjoy sci-fi classics like \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and \"Them!\"; if you love the Britishness of the Hammer horror pictures; if you prefer a well-told story, rich suspense, sympathetic characters and black-and-white photography to special effects, color and gore, you will want to see this film right away. The movie begins in Midwich. We meet the scientist Gordon Zellaby having a telephone conversation. Mid-sentence he passes out. At the same moment, every single person and animal in town has passed out just as suddenly; some unknown force has put all the inhabitants of Midwich to sleep. When the army gets involved, we discover this force has precise boundaries. One soldier, after being lassoed around the waist, walks past the boundary, loses consciousness and immediately revives when his fellows pull him out of the infected area. A few hours later, this strange force disappears and everyone wakes up. The mystery remains unsolved for weeks, but it has a sequel. All Midwich women of childbearing age are unaccountably pregnant. Watching this science-fiction movie paired with almost any modern one demonstrates how storytelling has devolved as special effects have advanced. It also demonstrates how one simple effect can be more memorable than a thousand complex ones. I happened to see this just before watching \"The Forgotten\" (2005), a stupid movie with expensive effects; but not of those expensive effects is as potent as this movie's signature device. When the blonde-haired Midwich children wreak psychic havoc, the picture freezes and their eyes glow. That inexpensive trick shot is worth the millions blown on \"The Forgotten.\" Another nice effect: George Sanders. He plays the hero, Gordon Zellaby, a scientist who becomes a dubious father to one of the Midwich freaks. Sanders plays rogues in almost every other movie, but here he is sweet-natured and convincingly so; he betrays not a shadow of his usual cynicism. Were this his only surviving film, one would think he was born to play kindly old men. The excellent cast has one other outstanding performance by Martin Stephens, who plays Sanders's cold-hearted \"son.\" Would you be surprised to learn his voice was dubbed by a female actress specializing in children? I was surprised to learn it wasn't. That is the boy's own eerily precise diction. Special praise must also go to the director and photographer, Wolf Rilla and Geoffrey Faithful, who give the movie the detached air of a documentary. The script, credited to Stirling Silliphant, George Barclay and Rilla, is an excellent adaptation of a fine book, \"The Midwich Cuckoos\" by John Beynon Harris. Fans of this movie will want to read it. The book has many enjoyable details that were necessarily and wisely cut from the adaptation. To note one difference, the children in the movie are psychically linked: what one knows they all know. But in the book, the boys are psychically linked with the boys, the girls with the girls; but there is little or no link between the two sexes. The reasons for this are fascinating. I haven't seen the John Carpenter remake, and I don't want to. What would the ideal remake of this film look like? It would look like the original: black-and-white, set in the late fifties, cast with Brits and scripted with the same restraint. Maybe modern resources could add a piquant touch or two; it would be amusing to see all those sheep fall asleep in the opening scene. Oh, and that awful model shot of the school could be replaced. Otherwise, we have the film we want, so why remake it?",
         "at least if you're a science fiction and horror fan. There's a great build-up here and a very satisfying climax. This has a wonderful eerie feel reminiscent of the feeling one gets watching \"the original Outer Limits\". The story feels a little bit more like \"the Twilight Zone\" however with the questions of morality, right and wrong it raises. This film might not appeal as widely to non-genre fans but it's classic great stuff for the fan. Best scenes involve the eyes--it's a very effective nightmare when it's your own children who are the evil ones(or are they?).",
         "A small countryside village in England experiences a time period of several hours where all living things lie lifeless and helpless. Anything living that connects within this sphere of lifelessness gets the like treatment. Everyone soon awakens from whatever happened, and soon the women of child-bearing years all get pregnant and are all due on the same day. Village of the Damned is one of those discerning, intelligent science fiction films of yesteryear that tends to leave much to your imagination in terms of gore and violence as well as make you think and ponder important questions about the limits with which humanity should go to procure knowledge. The children are decidedly very creepy as their eyes glow when they are angered. Martin Stephens as George Sanders' boy is particularly good as he looks and speaks with such class and distinction yet has the conscience of a cold-blooded, calculated killer. Sanders is also very good in his role as a man torn between bridging the field of knowledge with the unknown and protecting mankind from foreign/alien harm. His wife, played with credibility, is Hammer beauty Barbara Shelley. A great British science fiction film and certainly one of the more thought-provoking ones around.",
         "This is a great Classic film mainly because of the great movie star George Sanders(Gordon Zellaby),\"Hangover Square\",'45, who unfortunately took his own life. In this film Sanders plays a professor and has the great pleasure of raising a child with Barbara Shelley(Antnea Zellaby), who turns out to become a child with glaring eyes and a very bad temper! It seems the children in this film seem to grow at a very rapid pace and have great hidden abilities to do just about everything they want in controlling the minds of all ADULTS! In 1960, this was a great Horror film and captivated the movie goers. This is truly a great Classic Film to enjoy!"
