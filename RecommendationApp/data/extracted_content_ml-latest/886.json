         "content": "I don't like your God. Your God scares me.\r\n\r\nStarring Adam Sandler and Damon Wayans, the former a criminal, the latter a cop, plot sees the mismatched pair thrust together to bring down a criminal kingpin (James Caan). So it's all set up nicely for a high energy action comedy from the realm of buddy buddy bonanza. Sadly it has energy to burn but the execution of the comedy is weak to the point the makers have to resort to the base level of comedy writing to try and get laughs. \r\n\r\nThe odd line raises a chuckle, but quite often this is followed by a period of inanity, which in turn is followed by a ballsy action sequence (the makers very aware they quickly need to keep the demographic genre fans back on the clock). All this while a budding bromance - that's coupled with some lame homophobic undertones (a revolver up the butt gag? Seriously?) - threatens to turn it into the Brokeback Mountain of the buddy buddy action genre of film. Hell! the screenplay even has the whiff of misogyny about it. \r\n\r\nThe stars are badly served by poor writing and direction, but they themselves are guilty of offering up a chemistry free movie that dulls the senses during all the interim talking sequences. It's hard to believe this is the same pair of actors who have The Wedding Singer and The Last Boy Scout on their respective curricula vitae. This is a waste of talent and a wasted opportunity for something fun and exciting. A pic only marginally saved by its shoot-outs and fisticuffs (for the so inclined of course). Oh and what was James Caan thinking? Working for food or what? 5/10",

      "synopsis": "Archie Moses (Adam Sandler) is a small time crook and thief who lives in Los Angeles, and he is working for a local drug lord Frank Colton (James Caan). He is unaware that his best friend Rock Keats (Damon Wayans) is actually an LAPD undercover cop, whose real name is Jack Carter, and who's seeking evidence against Colton, and he is trying to infiltrate Colton's gang. One night, Jack goes out with Moses and gets him drunk, and manages to get info from Moses, and he finds an address for one of Colton's fronts. During a raid on Colton's warehouse, Archie realizes that Jack is a cop, and he tries to escape the warehouse during the police raid, during which an out of control crane hits Moses in the back and he accidentally shoots Jack in the head, but he miraculously survives and makes a full recovery with the aid of his physical therapist Dr. Traci Flynn (Kristen Wilson). Moses then flees the state, and is subsequently found and arrested later on. Moses is brought into custody, and he agrees to testify against Colton, but the trial is at the other side of the country. After Jack's recovery, his superior officer Jensen (James Farentino) orders him to get Moses to transfer him personally to the courtroom. Having been bitter about the accident, Carter harbors resentment against Moses, and problems get escalated since a simple transfer has gone awry when Colton learns through bribed federal agents and Los Angeles Police Department officers of Moses's attempt to testify against Colton. Carter and Moses slowly mend their friendship and are successful in returning back to their local police department. However, Colton apparently holds Flynn hostage, and blackmails Carter into turning Moses over in order to save Flynn. Carter and Moses pretend to comply with Colton and shoot their way through Colton's guards. It is later revealed that Flynn was responsible for leaking Carter and Moses's whereabouts to Colton and was actually on Colton's payroll. Carter manages to distract Colton after Moses gets shot in the shoulder by Colton and after apprehending Flynn and Moses manages to kill Colton. Moses gives the incriminating documents on Colton to Carter, and he heads to Mexico, where he becomes a bullfighter, with Carter and Moses's mother later accompanying him.",

         "The criminals Rock Keats (Damon Wayans) and Archie Moses (Adam Sandler) are best friends and have been stealing cars together for one year. Archie invites Rock to join the gang of the drug lord Frank Colton (James Caan) without knowing that Rock is indeed the undercover detective Jack Carter, assigned to get evidences against Frank. During the police raid against a heroin shipping of Frank, Archie accidentally shoots Jack in his head. Once recovered, Jack declares Archie his enemy, and arrests him. But the former mates have to join forces against Frank's gangsters and many dirty cops. \"Bulletproof\" is a very funny police story, with a great timing and pace. There is a great chemistry between Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler, the good story has many twists and jokes, the cast is charming, especially the gorgeous Kristen Wilson and this is the second time that I watch this film and I still like it. This movie seems to be underrated in IMDb, with some very unfair reviews, and it is a great entertainment. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"À Prova de Balas\"(\"Bulletproof\")",
         "This movie, I think, is one of Sandler's best and I laughed my A off. I've watched it probably 15 times and I still laugh. I think the characters were well formed and the comedic chemistry between Sandler and Wayans was really entertaining! I think Archie Moses was a cute and fun character(especially when he used this Budweiser dog as a hostage and then out of guilt he lets the mutt go).I also love it when he and Keats are at each others throats one minute and then best buds the next. My favorite line in the whole movie is when Keats and Moses are pulled over by the cops and Moses has to pretend he's mentally challenged and while pulling a dopey face he says \"Disneylaaaaaaaaahhhhhnd.\" Hillarious. James Caan made a brief cameo as Sandler's notorious boss, Coulton and that was cool too.This movie is no Academy Award winner, but so what! It made me laugh and dispite other reviews it is my favorite Sandler, tied with The Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore off course. Very, very humerous.",
         "I really didn't find anything that bad in this movie, it has some big names and really entertaining. I found Adam Sandler's character Archie funny, along with Damon Wayans formed a good team. James Caan as the bad guy was a nice choice. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending, but nothing that big to gripe about this is worth renting if you like Sandler, cussing, and fun action.",
         "Bulletproof is one of those movies that the critics are obviously going to give a blow and thumbs down, but in reality, I really had a good time watching Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler dodging bullets, cussing each other out, just basically getting on each others nerves. An undercover cop named Rock Keates (Damon Wayans) is planning to arrest long time friend Archie Moses (Adam Sandler) on drug accounts. When the bust goes terribly wrong, Keates is ACCIDENTLY shot in the head by Moses. Days later, Moses is arrested by the survived Keates and both are put into a danger situation with an airplane. After the plane crashes in the desert, Keates and Moses annoy each other the whole way down. Damon Wayans (My Wife and Kids) and Adam Sandler (Big Daddy) star in this hilarious comedy that will have you laughing!",
         "Bulletproof is one of the funniest and action filled movies I have ever seen in a long time, and Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler are a great team, and James Caan is also good as the drug boss Frank Colton. The whole cast kept me laughing, and the action kept the adrenaline running. 4 out of 5",
         "This movie is about friendship and betrayal. Both of the major characters in this movie are betrayed by their closest friends, and come to understand what it is really like to be betrayed. One of them is an undercover cop while the other is a criminal, but also quite timid, but has joined forces, and then earned the emnity, of a major drug lord. The movie opens with the cop and Archie Moses as best friends stealing a car, but we quickly learn that the cop is an undercover cop who is trying to bust a drug dealer who owns a huge car dealership. Moses then brings the cop to the factory and it is discovered that he is a cop and the police raid the place. The cop wants to protected Archie, but due to an accident, Archie shoots him in the head. Months later, the cop has fallen in love with his therapist and Archie is running from the drug lord. He is found by the police but requests that this cop return and escort him back. There isn't much to say about this movie other than how they begin as best friends, but after the truth is revealed, Archie cannot trust him anymore. The cop in upset because Archie shot him, but does not want to believe that it was an accident. We also know that somebody else is tipping them off, but we do not know who, but the movie is about the friend's betrayal, and is summed up in Archie's comment to the cop, \"now you know how it feels to be betrayed by a friend.\" The drug lord is interesting because he also owns a used car yard and we always see his advertisement on television. It is as if this guy is flaunting himself in front of everybody, and those who know the truth about him are frustrated because they cannot get at him. Archie has the evidence, but the guy wants Archie dead because of his relationship with the cop. This is not a bad movie, but Adam Sandler has done far better. It is not really a comedy, more of an action movie, and though Sandler does act weirdly, this movie does not stand out in my opinion.",
         "I think Bulletproof may be a better movie than Billy Madison, but outside that it's the worst Adam Sandler movie yet. First there are quite a few scenes of dumb dialogue none of which are funny. And second this movie has some bad action sequences. In the end this movie can't seem to make it's mind if it's an action movie or a comedy and who really cares. *1/2 out of **** for Bulletproof!",
         "Mixing hard, violent action and yuk-yuk humor is very difficult to do successfully, and this movie proves it. Though I like action, and I like comedy, I just don't find the sight of people being bloodily blown away hilarious, as this movie seems to think. The action scenes are bland. There is some humor, but it's pretty spotty. Bottom line: only watch if you have nothing else to do and no other choice.",
         "I believe this movie was highly, highly underrated. Sandler and Waynes(spelling?) work amazingly together, in my opinion. It seems that for some reason this year this movie was overlooked, maybe because of Happy Gilmore, which is a possibility. Definitely one of the better action/comedies of the 90's, as you can see I feel strongly about it. The plot is very interesting, and there definitely are some twists and turns that do keep you guessing. As you can see from this movie Sandlers career went uphill, as Waynes seems to have fallen. This movie reminds me a lot of Nothing to Lose (starring Martin Lawrence) and other movies of the sort. I don't know what it is but I have a soft spot in my heart for the 90's action/comedies.",
         "Not only was this a bad action movie, but it was a bad Adam Sandler movie (Hey, that's a little bit redundant, isn't it?) But what I really wondered is why James Caan wasted his time in it. Why would a great actor who played in the Godfather movies want to embarrass himself in such trash? Sandler plays a conman who unknowingly befriends a cop, played by Damon Waynes. When Sandler reveals that he knows the kingpin behind a massive heroin ring, he leads Waynes to the location, Sandler finds out that Waynes is going undercover as a cop, and shoots him in the head (by accident). Nevertheless, he recovers. To make it so the movie's plot goes on par with the title, they put a metal plate on the wound. \"Bulletproof\" Get it? Ooh, that's so clever and funny! My sides are splitting. I won't tell what happens from there. If you're brave enough to tolerate mental pain from sheer stupidity, you'd see it for yourself. This movie wasn't only a rip-off of several other action movies, but the jokes were unfunny and offensive, many of them being sexist, homophobic, or racist."
