         "My sister and I originally rented this film when I was 9/10 years old. Since then I have watched it possibly 20 times. Its one of the funniest films I've seen and is not only a great flashback of the 80s [Although not a damn patch on 13 GOING ON 30] but a hilarious bimbo movie, possibly the best if it weren't for 2004's MEAN GIRLS. This is an endearing, funny, mean, warm movie about the innocence of being a bimbo and its negatives and positives. Lisa Kudrow is especially comfortable in this role thanks to Pheobe. It's not exactly high brow humour, but the laughers and great characters of the 97 set picture not only bring back memories of the 1990s now but it also lets us all know that we shouldn't accept the crap of todays Hollywood. Brilliant [A]",
         "ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION (1997) ***1/2 Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow, Janeane Garofalo, Alan Cumming. Hysterically funny comedy about two best friends/roomies Sorvino and Kudrow (think female \"Dumb and Dumber\") facing their 10th high school reunion and, realizing their lives are not worth really bragging about, coming up with pseudo lives. Lots of belly laughs especially Kudrow's explanation of how Post-It glue is made and her run in with a limo. Garofalo is a scream as their fellow bitter alumni. Kudos to costumer Mona Maya's outlandishly colorful creations, Robin Schiff's kitschy screenplay based on her play \"Ladies' Room\" and a waycool soundtrack of ersatz 80s tunes (best one: The Smithereen's \"Blood & Roses\" to start off the flashback). Directed in high comic style and snappish glee by David Mirkin.",
         "\"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion\" is a terrific comedy that you can't miss. This film is plain fun and makes you laugh throught the movie!! Mira Sorvino is great as Romy White , as is Lisa Kudrow as the ditsy yet fun Michele, and Janeane Garfolo as the rude and moody Heather Moony. This film is a sure great comedy. If you liked \"Clueless\" or \"Legally Blonde\" this is a great film for you!!! The acting is great, and the film itself is a non-stop laughing machine!!!!! This is a great and hilarious film that keeps you laughing!! I give this film a 10 out of 10!!!! :)",
         "Romy and Michele have been friends since school. They stick to each other and just have the best time together. In school they were outcasts but it never phased them one bit. They currently reside in L.A. and are exactly how they were in school. When they hear that there is a high school reunion, they are over joyed about going back to meet everyone again; even their nemesis the A group. But they realise that people might not be impressed with their lives, so they think of a lie that makes them look really successful. But from this simple lie their friendship is broken apart and are made the laughing stock at the reunion. Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is a great little comedy of nostalgia; looking back upon school years, the fashion, the music and how people were back then; seeing that they've changed or just stayed completely the same. Overall this doesn't say much; there is that moral that friendship is the most important and to stand by your friends in any situation. There is that idea also that when people look back upon school years people realise if they were liked or not; Christy and the A group finding they were the most hated and despised and that the 'freaks' of school go on to be the most successful. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow fit their characters perfectly; giving so much energy and naivety to them. Janeane Garofalo was great as the surly, fowl mouthed Heather Mooney and Alan Cumming as the nerdy Sandy Frink is also great. It isn't the best comedy, but its still a great watch. Makes you look upon your own school years.",
         "Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michele (Lisa Kudrow) live in Venice, California and love watching the film Pretty Woman. They also adore going out to the dance clubs every night and looking for their own potentially rich boyfriends. However, on most evenings they end up turning down invitations from jerks and dancing with each other instead. Word arrives that their ten year high school reunion is approaching. Since Romy and Michele were certified geeks at school, they get the idea that they will make a triumphant return as winners. After all, they both look pretty and they can make up the rest. So, they outfit themselves as successful businesswoman, with a hot car and cell phone and take off for Arizona. Will they be able to fool the old gang with their new, trumped-up identities? This is a classic tale of dumb blondes who are clueless but, who nevertheless, end up making good. Sorvino and Kudrow are perfection itself as the dimwitted but lovely blondes. Janeane Garofalo is also on hand to steal scenes with her acid wit and intelligence. The costumes are to die for and the overall production values are very nice. But, most importantly, the humor is abundant and zestful. If you need to drop all your worries and get your fighting spirit back, spend an evening with the delightful Romy and Michele. They will make you giggle and get you ready to face the more somber world again with a renewed and optimistic attitude.",
         "\"Romy & Michele's High School Reunion\" is all about Sorvino and Kudrow as a couple of best friend ditzes who have supported each through and since school and are confronted with their first high school ten year reunion. This female frolic depends entirely on the audience buying into the fun and funniness of the two leads and their nonstop blonde moments. The rest of the film is the usual high school reunion gig with all the stereotypes in place and the usual morals about just being yourself, being happy with who you are, being real, etc. Personally, I adored this flick but then I love \"Adventures in Babysitting\", \"Sixteen Candles\", and \"Hollywood Knights\" which requires going to a whole different place in your head to get away from \"Gone With the Wind\", \"Citizen Kane\", and \"2001 A Space Odyssey\". \"Clueless\" for the adult dating distaff. Fun, fun, fun. (B)",
         "For those of us who weren't in the \"in\" crowd, but turned out OK, this movie is a hoot. And the message is pretty clear: Happiness comes from within, not how successful people think you are. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorveno excel as to Blonds who return to their high school reunion intent on making the \"Popular People\" stand up and take notice. These two are the movie, and an confused appearance by Janeane Garofalo only garbles the basic plot, which isn't wide enough to absorb her. Alan Cummings bit part shows his true talent of being able to step into any role and fit in. The only place where the movie fails is too much time with Romy and Michelle in L.A., and not enough with them at the reunion, which if written correctly could have made this laugh out loud funny.",
         "In recent times many films have been made about the boring lives of American teenagers.If there is one film which has the ability to stand apart from a huge crowd of inane Hollywood teen pictures,it is surely Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.It is a perfect film which does not hesitate in attacking fake American values prevalent in high schools.It is a known fact that there is too much pressure on American high school children to succeed in all realms of life.There are many people who become a part of this system.There are some like Romy and Michelle who decide to follow their own paths.Hollywood director David Mirkin has directed a nice film about these two girls who do not take their lives seriously.It is through a great soundtrack that we are showed a not so rosy picture of the lives of disillusioned souls like Romy and Michelle.It is a nice film which teaches us that people can be happy with what they are.One has to remain true to oneself if one wants to be respected.Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino look fabulous as Romy and Michelle.",
         "\"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion\" is a movie that I've heard about for a long time, having seen the video stored at someone's house or whatnot. But I've never gotten a chance to see this movie until now. The verdict is while there are some funny moments, and the ending is good, there are enough dead spots to only get it a lukewarm recommendation. Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michele (Lisa Kudrow) are two best friends...and first class ditzes. Both of their IQs are far below what is considered normal, and the term \"Valley Girl\" seems to have been tailor made for them. They are living \"stylishly\" in LA when an old school chum Heather Mooney (Janeane Garafalo) tells them about their high school reunion. But seeing as the only reason to go to the high school reunion is to boast about their careers (neither Romy or Michele has an enviable job), they decide to lie and pass themselves off as rich and wealthy business women. And the creators of Post-It Notes. The problem with the film is that it's too plot heavy for its own good. These two bimbos are hilarious in their own right, but Robin Schiff's screenplay (based on her play) spends too much time developing the story and not enough time letting the characters be themselves. There are plenty of flashbacks about how the Queen Bees of their school bullied them, but this material comes off as cruel, rather than funny. The movie is at it's best when it allows them to be the ultra-dim bulbs that they are, but there just aren't enough of these moments. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are terrific as the leads. Romy is the smarter one, although that's not saying much. Neither one is a stranger to playing a mental vacuum, and they're pretty funny. Surprisingly, Janeane Garafalo is ineffective as the cynical Heather. The character has to add a dose of emotional damage to her character, but Garafalo goes way far over the top. Garafalo can play a dramatic character, but she's just not very good in this film. Alan Cumming is good as the geek who has long held a torch for Michele. Camryn Manheim steals her scenes as the organizer. She's one of those people who is so into this thing that she doesn't realize that no one else really cares. We all know someone like this, and that's what makes it funny. Some people have been calling this a chick flick, and that's not necessarily true. It's not a sappy romance, and while the central characters are girls, the humor is such that members of both sexes can get it. Fluff, but not that great fluff.",
         "Seriously, Bunuel couldn't have come up with something so surreal. The 90s managed to generate some really neat exercises in irony, the blonde heroine who in her own fashionable and dizzy way stumbles upon self-empowerment and manages to stand up to the face of society, but this is no Clueless, mostly because the extended dream sequence just before the third act doesn't look, feel, or flow any different than the rest of the movie. The acting is uneven, too--Lisa Kudrow gets nowhere near the empathy Mira Sorvino illicits, and neither of them are nearly as interesting and Janeane Garofolo. However, honestly, once the three-way dance between Kudrow, Sorvino, and Cumming occurs, all bets are off. I felt higher than coke-addicted drunk mixing a cocktail of LSD and heroin to the mix for extra flavor. Seriously, the writing of this movie is straight-forward enough but the tone and progression of it is unaccountable. I can actually see the cult enjoyment this film gets, but whereas I was expecting something more along the Sugar and Spice lines, I wasn't expecting Legally Blonde meets Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. What a weird friggin' movie... --PolarisDiB"
