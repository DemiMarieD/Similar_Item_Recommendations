         "It always amazes how many opinions can come from the viewing of the same movie. But this movie should have as many admirers as possible. OK, the ending is predictable. So is eating, sleeping, working and making love. Is that any reason not to watch a movie? What makes CLOUDS wonderful is the ride. It is a beautifully acted ride: Keanu Reeves acting his guts out plus: international sensation Sanchez-Gijon, noted actress Aragon, veteran actress Elizondo, Giannini the legend and the irresistible Anthony Quinn, Beautifully directed: Alfonso Arau, Wonderful cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki, the wonderful music of Maurice Jarre and the song by Cuban Guitar composer, pedagogue and legend Leo Brouwer. What is bad about smiling during a movie? I found myself smiling and giggling during the grape stomping scene. Does it hurt when you laugh? I guess only if you are jaded, spoiled and bored with life. There is love, mysticism and joy...This is a movie to savor and breath in and enjoy the wonderful.. Walk in the Clouds....",
         "What a revelation, a romance, pure and simple, with no sex, no violence, no foul language just pure and simple romance. While many modern romance films claim to be such they invariably end up with hero and heroine ending up in bed (sometimes with a little too much detail thanks very much). But here, in this visually stunning feast, we have a romance where the hero, out of honour and respect, doesn't bed the heroine. I am amazed that it has taken me five plus years to see this movie, and I am grateful to the family channel for screening it for me to tape. With a relatively simple story, set against beautiful scenery with cinematography to die for, we are swept into a world of the past, where honour meant something, where marriage vows, no matter how hastily taken were still to be respected, and where a single pregnant female was a family shame (not the norm as today unfortunately). I read one review where the reviewer said \"in reality Paul would have said not my problem babe get an abortion\" in whose reality? 2002 reality perhaps but not 1940s reality, abortions were for bad, nasty girls in back streets, by unlicensed doctors not for nice girls who had made a mistake (okay so some things have changed for the better.) I simply loved this film, while it gives a fairy tale view of the vinyards and the family running it, it is a feast for the eyes and the soul. The entire cast are superb, particularly Anthony Quinn who relished his role as the family patriarch and seemed to simply enjoy being in this delightful tale and of course Keanu whose performance is so beautifully low key and understated he reminded me of those wonderful hollywood leading men of old, strong, silent, gorgeous, Cary Grant would have played this role back in the day, who would have thought to put Keanu in the same role? Turn off your 2002 brain and just revel in the sheer delight of this wonderful film. I just know I will watch this again and again.",
         "Does anyone recall a time when values, integrity, uprightness and true human compassion were a way of life? A Walk in the Clouds does. The story is sweet, romantic, dramatic, and heartwarming. The 1940's was an era when it was terrible shame to be unwed and pregnant. Daughters were often cast away or sent to some distant relative to bear their child in loneliness and disapproval, then the child was given for adoption. I know because I was one of those children. For my mother there was no Paul Sutton to love her and rescue her and her child. The father, portrayed by Giancarlo Gianni was a typical man of those desperate war torn years who was unable to get in touch with his feelings on any level except work and anger. I am more amazed at his ability to show affection for his wife than I am at the anger which rules his life. The family who eventually adopted me was just like this family. Hard horrible father, heavy drinker, full of anger, yet rapier wit and tongue. The rest of the family are so real because in those days most families who had a disagreeable father figure pulled together to make up for and cover over the hurts and embarrassment generated by that father. Very different from today's dysfunctional families. Anthony Quinn was superb and Keanu Reeves could not have been more believable as a simple man with a good heart and high values. His character is not meant to display anything but goodness, which he does beautifully. We have to remember that men used to be governed more by what was right than by the emotion of the moment as they are today. Aitana as Victoria is very lovely and desirable, but her character is also governed by the morals of the day. While she is sexy and flirtatious and clearly loves Paul, she stops short of using his attraction to her to seduce him because the very things she values and loves about him are his stability and uprightness. Today most women would simply go for it, but this film is not about today. It is about real love and true respect. The musical score is simply beautiful and very moving. The wine country and the shot of the California coast along Big Sur are great. Oh, by the by, for the unbelieving, after the grape harvest in the fall the branches of the vine die and become dry and brittle very quickly. The only part of a grape vine that continues to live is the stock and it's root, but even that seems all gray and dead from just looking at the outside. A fire in a dry, post-harvest vineyard would spread and destroy all, just as it did in the film. Today, there are sprinkler systems, etc. to prevent such loss, but not in the 1940's. What a great movie. I own it and will always enjoy watching it again and again.",
         "This film in one word, \"beautiful.\" Keanu Reeves and the rest of the cast make this film enjoyable. I am not a big fan of romance pictures, but this has to be one of the more enjoyable ones. The acting is superb and the story is excellent. A young woman heading back home meets up with a chocolate salesman. She is pregnant (but not married) and cannot bare to face her father. Keanu's character hides his true identity to play the role as her husband. This picture is worth seeing and I advise anyone to see it. Whether they are into romance films or not. People who bad-mouth this film are too dense to realize you don't need action and bloodshed to have a good movie.",
         "After working as an actor in such films as Sam Peckinpah's controversial Western \"The Wild Bunch,\" and starred in Alejandro Jodorowsky's legendary cult film \"El Topo,\" Alfonso Arau makes his directorial debut in a magical Mexican art film, 'Like Water for Chocolate,' set during the Mexican Revolution... His success makes him direct his first English-language feature, where he presents the strength and beauty of the bonds that can unite human hearts... The time was right after World War II... The place was more lovely than you ever imagined... Gorgeous scenery dominated by vineyards, the perfect nestle for a romantic fairy tale... Everything comes from the heart in this rich heartwarming film... Arau's vision and dream was to build a tunnel between what we know and don't know about two-spirited people, the roots and blood-ties of a family, its traditional values, and its attachment to the earth... Arau reinforces the borders of tradition in the Mexican aristocratic family who have lived on American soil for generations, describing her fundamental values: family solidarity, religious commitment, and cooperation with the land and nature... His motion picture derives its emotional power not only from the sweet love that blossoms between Paul and Victoria, but from the unconditional familial love that the young GI encounters while at her hacienda... Each type of love is strengthened through the knowledge that one leads to the other... Keanu Reeves plays the quiet expressive dreamer who finds the traditional values in a magical place... He is a genteel seller of chocolate candy who, en route on a train from San Francisco to Sacramento, meets a graduate student in crisis... He learns that she is frightened to return home because she is pregnant and unmarried... To protect Victoria from her father's wrath, and ignoring obviously the outcome, Paul tells Victoria that he believes \"there's a perfect someone for everyone - someone who'll love you no matter what.\" He gallantly insists in posing as her husband just for one night... Making her American film debut, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays the strong, exquisite woman 'so easy to love'... Victoria has been seduced and abandoned by a 'free spirit.' She is now on her way to her wine-growing family in Napa Valley to help with the annual grape harvest... While her silken butterfly big wings spread the heated air around the frozen grapes, Victoria's sight was enough to engulf Paul with desire... And when her dark hair tumbled down to him, Paul's face was burnt by the harshness of actually having been able to feel some part of her... This burning has been caused by something as soft and luscious as her beautiful black hair... It is simply Arau's shot of her luminous figure, that discreetly heightened her feminine mystique, and her strong sensuality... The legendary Anthony Quinn, a two-time Academy Award-winner for \"Viva Zapata\" and \"Lust for Life,\" is the wise patriarch, Don Pedro who tries to intensify the romance between Paul Sutton and Victoria, while her father tries his best to show his displeasure at her choice... While chomping Paul's chocolates, the sagacious old man shows the polite soldier the root from which the entire vineyard has grown, and instructs him the traditions and beliefs of his ultra-conservative family... Screen veteran Giancarlo Giannini (who received an Oscar nomination for his performance in \"Seven Beauties\"), plays the proud, suspicious, ultra-traditional father, whose beliefs are deeply rooted in tradition: 'My daughter can trace her roots back 400 years to the best families in Mexico,' he affirms... As a strong believer in the importance of family, Don Alberto Aragón reacts violently to the prospect of his beloved daughter already married to someone who has nothing... No family. No past. No future! If you want to be moved by a consummate screen composer, and enjoy a wonderful family dinner... If you want to watch Reeves and Quinn singing and getting drunk... If you want to observe joyous women rolling around in a tub of emerald green grapes, keeping pace with the help of musicians... If you want to admire sensational landscapes sleeping against the sunset sky, or forming like a dream out of the silver dawn... don't miss this breathtaking piece of visual art, and step into the magic!",
         "Who are you and what have you done with the real Keanu Reaves? This guy's come a long ways since Bill & Ted. I was floored by the cinematography, the story itself, and the way the family was portrayed, capturing the way so many of the wine-growing families of the day were in California--not to mention the traditions and mores that existed at the time. Anthony Quinn also turns in a stellar performance, as always, as the eccentric grandfather that really isn't quite as odd as he'd like everyone to believe he is, spots Reeves for what he really is early in the story, and pretty much drives him to face what should be his destiny--but lets him think that he's making up his own mind. All in all, I have to say this flick is a major winner, despite the fact that there's no sex, no one is gunned down, no one is blown to bits, and there are no computer generated graphics of meteorites plowing into gasoline refineries. See it.",
         "This is a magical movie. Even if you turn off the sound and just watch it, it is beautiful. Of course, if you turned off the sound, you would miss the beautiful music. As for the story, it is a fairy tale, totally unrealistic. But it is a very, very romantic fairy tale. I'm an overage, overweight, cynical old lady, but I still cried through half the movie. If you watch this movie, have a big box of tissues, a big box of chocolates, and a large dose of the willing suspension of disbelief. If you have even one romantic bone in your body, you'll love it. If you can't suspend your disbelief, skip it - you will just be irritated.",
         "Many women who have written reviews said Keanu Reaves was an ideal man. Most men would like to think they could live up to the quiet strength shown by Reaves portrayal of Paul Sutton. Of course a woman as stunningly beautiful as Aitana Sanchez-Gijon could certainly inspire such nobility. They are many roles that Reaves is not suited for. I am not a fan of his Matrix acting and please keep him away from Shakespeare. However playing a humble straight forward guy with some nobility he can do. Essentially that is what he was doing in Speed, Something has gotta give and this role. He even did that playing an adult turned teenager in Young Again. I am not sure he is a great actor but he is perfect for this part. Aitana Sanchez Gijon has a beautiful screen presence which has shocked me why the Hollywood hype machine has not tried to build her up like they did with Penelope Cruz. This film did nothing for her career over here. I would watch her over Jennifer Lopez, Penelope Cruz and dozens of other actresses that Hollywood has hyped into stardom. Giancarlo Giannini is great as the father. Although Italian, his portrayal of a Mexican with roots back to Spain was dead on. Living in Florida near Tampa, many Cubans In Tampa trace their ancestry back to Spain and exhibit the same type of pride he showed in the movie. It was also Anthony Quinn's best role in years. However the star of the show was the music and the photography. Except for perhaps the music and photography of Last of the Mohicans, I can not think of a film where the scenery and the music did so much for a film.",
         "This is an enjoyable film without a lot of surprises. It is pleasant without being really suspenseful, and its sweetness may be a little too much for the small screen where on the big screen, you just go with it. Aitana Sánchez-Gijón is flawless as the female lead, which is a good thing considering her leading man is the almost always flaw-FUL Keanu Reeves, who has amazingly held onto his leading man status despite having only his great looks and minimal talent (the modern-day Rock Hudson). With a great supporting cast (including a pre-Six Feet Under Freddy Rodriguez and a post-original \"Swept Away\" Giancarlo Giannini), Reeves' shortcomings as an actor can't help but stand out. Amid all the good players and romantic tone, there's also some lovely scenery and good costuming. But seeing this film on HBO nearly ten years after viewing it on the big screen begs the following questions: Why has Penelope Cruz been foisted on the American moviegoer when we could have had Aitana Sánchez-Gijón all along?! Why did it take Hollowood so long to rediscover Debra Messing after her bit part in this film? Why is Keanu Reeves a big star while the extremely sexy Gregory Martin (whom I still remember steaming up the small screen in the miniseries \"Ellis Island\") never appeared in a movie again? Man, he was hot! And although you wouldn't know it from his small role here, I'm sure he could act circles around you-know-who. I may never get answers to these questions, but if your video store doesn't carry \"Il Postino\" and \"Cinema Paradiso,\" you might want to check out this slightly inferior but nevertheless enjoyable film. The reason the story is timeless is because it is an English language remake of the 1942 film, \"Quattro passi fra le nuvole,\" and it was a good idea on the part of the producers to resurrect it.",
         "in the whole career of Keanu Reeves this is probably one of the mightiest movies ever ...probably anyone would envy him for working with the king himself \"Anthony Quinn\" in all the years Anthony Quinn whom has made many movies there wasn't a better interpretation on why people should break medication rules those doctors say Don Pedro no salt , Don Pedro no wine , Don Pedro no chocolates , Don Pedro no women ...they know about the needs of the body but what do they know about the needs of the soul .... He is one of the best actors to live in this Earth and I guess it was Earth's honor that he was in it ....this movie proves it with his noble decent yet lovely presence ...also the 1940 morals make the movie superb and Keanu's way of being so polite makes this movie more than just a classic...it makes it a \" You Must Buy\" kind of movie...."
