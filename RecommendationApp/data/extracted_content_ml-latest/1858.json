         "This film is certainly not an Academy Award Winner, but it most definitely is just a plain old good action film with tons of senseless fighting. The fighting is incredible in this film and the stunts are quite impressive, the choreography and the stunts are what make this film good, don't expect a great story or any great acting. The story isn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be, it's actually quite interesting and takes a little bit of step aside from Jackie Chan's typical cop character. This time he's simply a TV chef that gets mixed up in things against his will. It sounds pretty stupid, but it's not all that bad. The acting and even more so, the dialogue are two things that I'm not even going to begin to defend. The acting is pretty bad at times and the dialogue is god-awful! Sadly, a lot of the bad dialogue could easily have been avoided, I don't know what the writers/director was thinking. Virtually all of the cast members were new faces to me, with of course, the exception of Jackie Chan. Jackie does a good job with his role, exactly what you would expect from one of his films. I feel I have to mention Gabrielle Fitzpatrick, what a beautiful actress!!! And she's actually a pretty good actress, I'll definitely be keeping an eye open for her future work. If you are a fan of Martial Art films, or just like Jackie Chan, then watch this movie. Just watch this film thinking you are going to have a fun time watching Jackie kick some bad-guy butt! I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading, -Chris",
         "Melbourne, Australia, TV Journalist Diana (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick) tapes evidence against drug lord Giancarlo (Richard Norton), but on her way away , she is spotted and has to escape . Chinese Jackie (Jackie Chan) is a well known television chef who accidentally gets involved with the news reporter who filmed a drug bust that went awry and is now being chased by gangs who are trying to get the video tape . But when Jackie's visiting sweetheart Miki (Miki Lee) gets abducted for the tape as ransom. Jackie Chan's vehicle with plenty of over-the-top action , thrills , explosions , ingenious stunts , tongue-in-cheek and amusing music . This exciting movie is packed with adventure , intrigue , unstopped action , overwhelming stunt-work and lots of fights but with humor . Jackie Chan is top-notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous nasties led by Richard Norton and as always he makes his own stunts like is well showed . Awesome , incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include spectacular brawls in a mall , Jackie in a crane , jumping down a building , on a roof , in a globe , impressive and interminable fights with Chan dangling and downing , a funny door games , a breathtaking final full of destruction with a giant truck and other extraordinary action sequences in overwhelming style . This is a diverting action movie distinguished by nice cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entry . In the film appears known Outback secondary actors as Rachel Blakely , Barry Otto and Gabrielle Fitzpatrick as an intrepid reporter . Jackie Chan usually forms couple to notorious actors as Sammo Hung here as an unfortunate cyclist and also filmmaker and actresses as Maggie Cheung and Michelle Yeoh . In this outing Jackie contends a notorious Kung-Fu actor , Richard Norton , a fine action star in their own right and with a relatively successful career , that stands out as a masked ninja, in ¨Octagon¨ (1980), and their grueling final combat endures as a classic cinematic fight scene , director Robert Clouse chose Norton to be one of the ensemble heroes in ¨Force Five¨ (1981), an international hit, and the young martial artist's career in movies took off , his reputation for stellar performances emerged largely from high-energy Hong Kong films directed by Sammo Hung Kam-Bo and starring Jackie Chan in the mid-'80s. Muscular charisma made Norton the perfect Anglo bad boy for ¨Winners and sinners¨ (1985) and ¨Millionaires Express¨ . His collaborations with Cynthia Rothrock catapulted him to a high level of fame . Sammo Hung encouraged Norton to play in ¨Superchef¨ the \"Guy\" nemesis, a well-heeled gangster, with eccentric edginess, Norton embraced the assignment and delivered one of the best , though some excessive, co-starring performances in all of Chan's films. ¨Superchef¨ is a passable action movie distinguished by ferocious sequences , and packs silly sense of humor as well as Jackie's former and subsequent entries . Furthermore , moving and thrilling original musical score fitting to action . Good cinematography by Raymond Lam filmed in Chinatown Mall, Fortitude Valley, Queensland, Hunter Valley, New South Wales, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia . The picture achieved success in China and around the world . However , Jackie Chan's failed at Box-office in his American debut ,¨Battle creek brawl¨ . Chan usually pays overt homage to two of his greatest influences as Charles Chaplin and Harold Lloyd . Chan is a hard-working actor and director throughout his long and varied career . He went on playing ¨Cannoball¨ , ¨The protector¨ and \"Rumble in the Bronx\", until getting all American success with ¨Shangai Knights¨ , ¨The tuxedo¨ , ¨Around the world in 80 days¨ and ¨Rush hour¨ trilogy , and the recent ¨Karate kid¨. Of course , his biggest hits were ¨The Police story¨ series that won the Golden Horse Award, a Chinese version of the Oscar , the first was titled ¨Police story(1985)¨ directed by the same Chan , it was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was ¨Police story 2(1988)¨also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches. It's followed by ¨Supercop¨ or ¨Police story 3¨ and finally, ¨Police story IV : Crime story . ¨Superchef¨ rating : Acceptable and fun film that has its sensational moments here and there , but also with abundant humor touches mostly provided by its agile star , the super Jackie . It's a satisfying action film for enthusiast of the genre and specially for Jackie fans .",
         "In my review of 'Who Am I?', I mentioned that 'Rumble in the Bronx', 'First Strike', 'Mr Nice Guy', and 'Who Am I?' all followed a similar formula as Jackie tried to capture western audiences. After watching 'Mr Nice Guy' again, I was actually kind of surprised to realize that it was almost a carbon copy of 'Rumble in the Bronx' - a Rumble in Melbourne's Central Business District, anyway. Giancarlo (Richard Norton), Melbourne's top drug lord is angry because Diana (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick) has a tape that incriminates him. Jackie (Jackie Chan), a TV chef and arse-kicker extraordinaire comes into possession of the tape, making Giancarlo angry enough to kidnap Jackie's girlfriend Miki (Miki Lee). This makes Jackie angry. The end. Wow. It seems like I've written out the whole plot and embellished upon it rather than summarized it. I'm just kidding - or am I? 'Mr Nice Guy' might be a contender for the thinnest plot in the universe prize, and the so called \"supporting actors\" don't even seem to be trying to act. Almost everything that happens in 'Rumble in the Bronx' is recycled for this. Unfortunately, the hovercraft was replaced by heavy machinery. Nothing can be an adequate substitute for Rumble's hovercraft. Jackie kicking arse is the only reason for anyone to watch 'Mr Nice Guy'. It doesn't feature anything new or innovative, but any keen fan of Jackie should notice various 'Protector', 'Police Story' or 'Rumble in the Bronx' moments. It is a fun and exciting action film though, and that's what Jackie is all about. And now for something completely different: Yet again, 'Mr Nice Guy' features Jackie playing a character called Jackie. I'm convinced that Jackie quit acting for several years, and took up a life as a cop, spy, chef, etc. All the while he had a film crew filming his adventures in order to create easy action movies. It's the only logical explanation - the writers can't be that lazy, right? 'Mr Nice Guy' reeks of being direct to video, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun action movie. Fans of Jackie Chan or Sammo Hung should give this a look - 7/10",
         "The thinnest plot imaginable (1: Bad guys think Jackie has an incriminating tape, 2: Bad guys go after him), but it doesn't matter; the movie serves up one virtuoso action sequence after another, and some priceless comic dialogue as well (\"Oh my God, you want the tape too? If you find it PLEASE take it\"). Jackie was 43 when this was filmed, but he sure hadn't lost a bit of his physical dexterity. This film is much better in every way than his American \"breakthrough\" hit, \"Rumble In The Bronx\", and Richard Norton makes an enjoyable villain. (***)",
         "Thin on plot and fat with exciting stunts, Jackie Chan's \"Mr. Nice Guy\" is more like a speedy carnival ride than a movie. Chan plays a television chef who gets mixed up with a female reporter with an incriminating videotape that drug lords are after. Along the way Jackie Chan has his prerequisite close calls and death defying stunts mixed with his affable humor. All the stunts are good ones and there's a set-piece that requires Chan to escape his enemy in an unfinished building where all the blue doors are already installed that is my favorite. It's quite a farce having people opening and closing doors in pursuit and escape and never knowing who or what's behind the next door. One extended scene is a guilty pleasure for me and involves Chan commandeering a large earth moving vehicle and wreaking havoc with it. When I say large, I mean LARGE. The tires alone must be 12 feet tall in and of themselves. It's pretty cool to see the devastation this vehicle incurs. A fun film. Had the plot itself been a bit more thickened my rating would've been higher.",
         "This movie is a strange combination: quite possibly the thinnest plot and worst acting of any Jackie Chan movie... and some of the best and funniest fight scenes, as well. Fortunately the movie moves along briskly and there's never much time between humor and fight scenes for you to dwell on just how bad the acting was in the preceeding scene.",
         "You have to have kind of a high threshold for silliness (and bad acting) to enjoy this one. The plot's almost nonexistent, but it's got some good (little) fight scenes and stunts....A little disappointing, though, that Jackie doesn't get to fight lead villain Richard Norton, quite a good fighter (see \"City Hunter.\") The ending's pretty funny though. Probably the most \"Turn off your brain, and enjoy\" Jackie film since \"Rumble in the Bronx,\" it delivers fun, plain and simple.",
         "If you want to see great action scenes, stunts and fights... watch this! And this film is funny too... \"How the hell did he do that???\" :) If you want to see good acting... Avoid this :)",
         "C'mon, all of you! Throw some more votes into the pot if you've seen enough out of everything! Jackie Chan's recent movies including MR. NICE GUY show their prescnce in the Hollywood mainstream thanks to a special ingredient: originality. Take your pick at RUMBLE IN THE BRONX and thereafter! Impressive and fast stunt choreography from TV chef Chan is astounding and well done, something that highly trained professionals have died for. Voices aren't dubbed this time around, but Chan's accent takes some learning. The touch of comedy is another welcome feature, making this one specially entertaining. Fat bicyclist steals the show for fighting back, and the end outtakes are a nice bonus. There are a couple of gripes, though. MR. NICE GUY tends to run the same route as R.I.T.B. from start to finish (like the giant truck finale), and it could have been less on stupidity, but as I said before, the comedy was welcome. More movies like this would (almost) put James Bond 007 in the retirement home! Another must-see for action buffs! Another must-have for the fan of Chan!",
         "This film has some of the worst acting, and very nearly the worst plot of any movie out there. But I loved it. The action sequences (and to a lesser extent the comedy) are really impressive in this film. Its what we've come to expect from Jacki Chan movies. The finale is really quite impressive. The acting in itself is quite humorous. Aussie actors doing really bad american accents, or just totally overacting. And some of them are actually quite good in other roles. There also is a question to be raised over the editing. Why was the take where I was standing in the background not used? Doh, I could've been a movie star!"
