         "It's cold in the small hamlet of Mystery, Alaska, but there's plenty of warmth in `Mystery, Alaska,' the film, directed by Jay Roach, about the town and the sport that is ingrained in the collective consciousness of the community. Hockey is the game, and when a former resident, now a journalist, writes a story about Mystery's home-town team and their `Saturday Game,' and it ends up as a three page spread complete with pictures in Sports Illustrated, it has far reaching effects on the populace of this small dot on the map. Soon the town is turned upside down, embroiled in an event, the proportions of which, to them, are huge. Needless to say, it involves hockey and an encounter with a high-profile professional team. Yes, there is a lot of hockey in this movie, but be advised, this film is not `about' hockey; this is a movie about people\u0096 real people\u0096 and what makes them tick. Roach has crafted a thoroughly entertaining and emotional story of want and need, dignity and desire, obsession and love, and he's captured it all through the winning performances of a stellar ensemble cast, the most prominent of which is Russell Crowe. The charismatic Crowe, finally on his way to superstardom thanks to his turn in `Gladiator' plays John Biebe, Mystery's sheriff and captain of the hockey team. His rugged good looks and persona fit the character perfectly, and he puts all of his myriad personal resources to work to put it across, and that he does. Also notable is the personable Mary McCormack as John's wife, Donna, who does a great job of fleshing out the character of this woman who made what she deems to be the right choices in her life, without regrets or apologies to herself or anyone else. It's a refreshing portrayal, and the chemistry between her and Crowe is unmistakable. Also adding to the overall texture of this film are Hank Azaria, as Charles Danner, the journalist who gets the whole thing rolling; Burt Reynolds, as Judge Walter Burns, a man forced to deal with his own personal issues, which include a son, Birdie (Scott Grimes), a member of the hockey team; Colm Meany, as Scott Pitcher, Mayor of Mystery, and Lolita Davidovich as his wife, Mary Jane; Maury Chaykin, as Bailey Pruitt, the man who seems to personify the very essence of Mystery's spirit; and Ron Eldard as `Skank,' another member of the team who's good for two things\u0096suffice to say that hockey is one of them. Mercifully, `Mystery, Alaska' never pursues the beat-the-dead-horse cliched mentality that sports `teaches one to be a team player and builds character.' Instead, Roach has given us a worthwhile, memorable movie with a human touch, and because of that, in the end these are people you care about, as individuals as well as a community. The climactic game is exciting and far from predictable, beginning with the celebrity they bring in to sing the National Anthem. This may not be one of Russell Crowe's biggest or highest profile movies, but this is one he's going to be able to look back upon with pride, because it's right up there with his best. Remember, you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this movie; all that's required is that you have a membership in the club know as Mankind. I rate this one 9/10.",
         "Mystery Alaska was one of the best comedies to come along in 1999. In the best ensemble film fashion a truly eclectic cast forms the very core of the story that is Mystery, Alaska. Hank Azaria turns in a spectacular performance as \"the ugly duckling\" \u0096 a character not too popular who escaped the town for fame and fortune in television sports. He garners the small town some big time noteriety when the announces that the New York Rangers will challenge a game against the locals pond hockey team. Typical small town chaos ensues as all prepare for the big event. Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Mary McCormack all turn in fine performances contributing nicely to the oddities inherent in any small town. While the story can seem a bit forced formulaic, David Kelly's script and Jay Roach's directing bring a freshness and satisfaction that made this one of 1999's best sleepers. A most watchable feel good movie.",
         "... That a film so seemingly inconsequential pays such care and attention to its characters is to its utmost credit. Before viewing I mistakenly assumed this was a gig Crowe took only because he needed the career-boost. How wrong I was! We've all essentially seen this before in one form or another; underdogs band together to reaffirm pride for their history and heritage, all thanks to the great leveller we've come to know as 'sports'. Sure, all the expected clichés are present, and I did get a little annoyed at just how MUCH hockey was in the last segment, considering I'd previously been enjoying the character details too much to really care about the event that unifies them - but it's the rich characterisation that prompts many a smile, delighted laugh and one or two moments of poignancy. It's 'fuzzy' - and I guess perhaps manipulative - without being sickening, and that must come down to Kelley's background in the world of populist TV. There are enough sharp lines to offset the sentiment, so you don't tend to bristle when it's there! Jay Roach really impressed me with this one, as it proves that he's more than 'adept' enough to handle a little pathos, too; a branch of comedy I somehow don't see the Austin Powers franchise extending toward... ! Although the final game is a bit 'dull' from my perspective, the hockey training scenes are inventively shot; keeping the speed and fluency of a viscerally exciting spectacle. Burt Reynolds again excels after \"Boogie Nights\", with a completely different performance this time - 'quiet dignity' instead of brash smarm. Really it's unfair to single out, though, from such a fantastic ensemble. It's the sense of togetherness and perfect encapsulation of small-town spirit that makes this work, and if you're searching for a movie to lift your gloom then it's no 'Mystery' where you should look: Alaska... ! 9/10.",
         "The preview for this movie does not give the audience enough of an idea of how well this movie actually plays out. Russell Crowe is not just an ill-mannered detective from Los Angeles, or a Gladiator from ancient Rome; no, in Mystery, Alaska, he showed that he indeed has a nurturing, almost lovable side to him. Mystery is a small, quiet town located smack dab in the middle of Alaska. It is a town where hockey is the most important thing in their lives. There are special \"Saturday Games\" where the town's Mayor, and two other board members select a few townsfolk to play against each other for the enjoyment of the other townspeople. When an article about this town and their hockey playing is published in Sports Illustrated, The NHL decides that the N.Y. Rangers would play an exhibition game in Mystery, Alaska for a little publicity. Throughout this movie, the people of Mystery band together and eventually play their game against the Rangers.... This movie is well worth the $3.79 to rent, if you weren't one of the lucky ones to see it in the theater. As much as I enjoyed this movie, there was one scene which was a little reminiscent of Varsity Blues. The acting is wonderful, and I think that everyone that gives this movie a chance will appreciate the great story.",
         "There are now over 100 reviews of this movie. And I guess my little blog won't matter much. But I love this movie. Anyone who is into hockey will surely fall in love with this movie. Watch out for some of the language if you're going to have younger kids watching. The first time I saw this I was maybe 13 or 14 and I remember my buddy (our goalie no less) telling me to relax. I guess I had my fists clinched all during the game hoping the Rangers would lose. Sorry if I sound biased. But I AM! Anything smelling of hockey grabs my interest. (Pun intended. As anyone who has been in a locker room knows that hockey players REEK) But, seriously, this movie was a lot better than most hockey movies. I actually like this movie more than \"Miracle\" which is another of my favourites. So my thoughts are, if you like hockey even a little bit you better check this one out if you haven't already.",
         "I was drawn to this movie because I love hockey and Russell Crowe. Both are seen to good advantage in this sweet movie. I thought it dragged in parts and some of the drama is forced, but overall it was a enjoyable movie and I had a good time watching it. It has a terrific cast - any movie with Chaykin, Meaney, Ivey and Davidovitch as your supporting cast has a lot going for it right there.",
         "I had no idea at the time that I would enjoy a movie about hockey, and I was right, because this movie had nothing really to do with hockey.It's a great character based movie about a small town that makes it big and the reason the town makes it big is because of it's people. It's a great rocky type movie that makes you root for a small town and it's wonderful characters. Russell Crowe is excellent as well as the entire cast and a great turn by Burt Reynolds as the town judge and coach. This is a very well crafted, witty , warm and realistic and just a charming movie overall. Don't let the hockey fool you, this is a movie about people and a quite enjoyable movie I may add.",
         "I enjoyed this film. It, as others have said, had great heart. The many important subplots of the film were played out very convincingly by a fine group of actors. But the issues and how they came to be were only skimmed over leaving you wanting to delve further - know more. The fairly realistic ending would have had a much bigger impact if we could have felt closer to the characters. This great little story could have really hit the spot with a closer look via a good long book.",
         "In a place where the sheriff is captain, the grocer is the marquee player, a high school senior who is the rising star of the team, and the town judge is the coach comes a hockey team from a small town on the outskirts of greatness. Russell Crowe leads all-star cast that included Hank Azaria, Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich, Ron Eldard, Colm Meaney, Maury Chaykin and Burt Reynolds in \"Mystery, Alaska.\" Full of hope, pride and determination, \"Mystery, Alaska\" will capture the hearts of the audience. A 13-year tradition in Mystery where everybody comes together to participate in the Saturday game, a hockey game played every Saturday, draws the interest of the National Hockey League and the New York Rangers. Azaria comes to propose this challenge to the townspeople of Mystery. After some debate at a town meeting, the mayor accepts the challenge to play the New York Rangers; the players must put their personal feelings aside to win the game. This game between the team from Mystery and the Rangers becomes a David and Goliath match-up, which ultimately comes down to which team can outduel the other first. Can the team from Mystery rise to the challenge given by the New York Rangers? Crowe is an actor that has brought integrity to his roles such as Officer Bud White in \"L.A. Confidential.\" Crowe, who received critical praise as Bud White, brought the same amount of integrity to \"Mystery, Alaska,\" as soft-spoken Sheriff John Biebe. Burt Reynolds, who has starred in Boogie Nights and received an Oscar nomination for his role as Jack Horner, portrayed hard-nosed Judge Walter Burns in \"Mystery Alaska.\" Reynolds role as Judge Burns turned out to be very impressive since it seemed that he took his time and enjoyed portraying the small town judge/coach from Mystery. Co-writers David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne as well as director Jay Roach work in conjunction to make one of the best films in 1999. Kelley, who has enjoyed success as producer of \"The Practice,\" \"Ally McBeal\", \"Chicago Hope,\" \"L.A. Law\" and \"Picket Fences,\" has brought originality to the film. This film allows the audience to sit back, relax and focus on putting themselves in the movie. \"Mystery, Alaska\" is a highly recommended film that should be seen by everybody because it was performed by a talented cast, well-put together by the writers and director, has a great plot, and noteworthy performances by the actors.",
         "This movie is easy to bash because of its \"underdog\" formula, but this is one of the better spins I've ever seen put on it. Mystery, Alaska is a small, ice-covered town that no one would ever have heard of were it not for former resident Charles Danner's (Hank Azaria) article on the \"Saturday game\" of hockey that has become a ritual in the town. Danner sings the town's hockey praises, likening their skating ability to that of \"any team in the NHL,\" and the gods of fiction hear the call, arranging for an exhibition game between the New York Rangers and the Mystery players. This sets off storms of conflict and multiple subplots which give this film a depth normally not found in the genre. The hockey game itself is almost an afterthought, because while the players know how to play the game, they don't have the same mastery over their daily lives. John Biebe (Russell Crowe) is the town sheriff and involuntarily-retired player from the Saturday game who is called upon to return to the team as their coach and as a player. His wife, Donna (Mary McCormack), is proud of the life she has built and slightly wistful about what the rest of the world would have held for her, but is content with what she has and does not live with her head in the clouds. Burt Reynolds is excellent as town judge Walter Burns, who must grapple with his teenage children, one of each gender, with the boy lacking the ambition Walter has for him, and the girl being a little too ambitious for his taste with her boyfriend. Colm Meany is the town Mayor who must deal with marital conflicts, and the remaining characters are what you'd expect to find in a closely-knit small town. The game itself is more like something out of \"The Air Up There\" than any of the movies mentioned in the other reviews. In that movie, the Africans played basketball for much the same reason as the Mystery boys play hockey, and as in that movie, the talent pool from the area is rich enough for the pros to take more than a passing look at the players (two of the Mystery players wind up signing with the Rangers and playing for their minor-league outfit in Binghamton). The players' main worry is that they'll get blown out by the Rangers, and shatter their illusions about their talent, but since the game is held on \"their pond,\" where they believe \"nobody beats them,\" they weren't about to back down. The Rangers, at first reluctant opponents who would rather have had some time with their families, get an early wake-up call in the game that causes them to remember why they played hockey in the first place, and take the game as seriously as a Stanley Cup final from then on. It is then that we see that while the Mystery players may lack the polish of the NHL, they are hardly outclassed. As expected, the Zamboni makes a cameo, as does Mike Myers as a former player/announcer. The movie has the usual small-town hostility towards outsiders, including some ribald swipes at a female TV reporter, but throughout the movie, we see what makes this town tick, and how their commitment to hockey is one that every professional player should never lose. Sports may be a business, but in the end, the play is the thing, and this movie makes that point better than many of the better-known films that try to drive home the same point."
