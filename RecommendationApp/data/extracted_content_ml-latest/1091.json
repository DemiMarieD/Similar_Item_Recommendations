While working one weekend, Richard and Larry discover that someone has been stealing money from the company. They report it to Lomax. Unfortunately for Richard and Larry, it was Lomax and his henchmen who had been doing the stealing. Lomax lures them to his summer home with the promise of a relaxing weekend - little do they know he's hired a hit man to knock them off. Shortly after the guys arrive, Lomax dies, presumably from a drug overdose. This thwarts the hitman's plan since he was supposed to wait until Lomax had left his home. Eventually, Richard and Larry realize what is going on and they decide to prop Bernie up and cart him around with them so that they cannot be killed. Hilarity ensues.",

         "Maybe I'm just stupid, but I love this movie. I still remember when it came out and maybe it's just nostalgia because I watched it so many times when I was nine years old, but I still enjoy watching it. It does a pretty good job at catching the look and feel of the late 80s. All the hairstyles and clothing are pretty dated but to me, that's all part of the fun. It all starts when our guys, Richard and Larry, discover a $2 million insurance fraud scam in their company. When they report it to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser) he seems grateful and invites them to his beach house for labor day weekend. As it turns out, Bernie is the one doing the scamming and has hired a mob hitman to take them out. Little does Bernie know, that the mob has decided that Bernie has been a little too careless and they have decided to take him out instead. So, by the time Richard and Larry reach the island, they discover that Bernie is dead from what looks like a drug-overdose. Instead of calling the cops, the less than bright Larry, decides it better to pretend that he didn't die. This will work since all of the island partyers are pretty self-absorbed and clueless. This is where it starts getting funny. Since the hitman is still on the island, he keeps seeing Bernie, who he thought he killed and keeps re-killing him. It's hilarious, because the boys really don't have a clue that the hitman is even around. Watching them lug a dead corpse around, making him look alive, is one of the highlights. The fact that all of the islanders believe he's alive is even funnier. One of my favorite parts of the movie was Andrew McCarthy's performance as Larry. His slacker part killed me and he has some really funny lines. What ever happened to him? Jonathan Silverman also does a great job with an underwritten part. He plays the ulcer-bound Richard who SO tries to be the moral center of the situation. Terry Kiser is incredible, as always and he plays a dead guy VERY well. Some of the stuff that he has to do, I really can't see anyone else pulling off as well. My favorite scenes came when Bernie was alive. The guy is such an unbelievable jerk, he's actually fun to hate. Ignore the other comments on here, and go get this one. It's great for some laughs and I STILL get a lot out of it everytime I watch it. A great semi-black comedy. Go pick it up and look for the sequel. I enjoyed it as well, although not quite as much.",
         "This is one of the funniest films ever made. Sure, it's stupid, and it could never really happen, but it is hilarious. The 3 main actors are great, esp. Terry Kiser (Bernie). The boat scene is the best. Anyone with a sense of humor will love this movie.",
         "Weekend at Bernies! Sure it is dumb. But the comedy is so smartly done that it makes it hilarious. I for one laugh my butt off every time I watch this movie. It is one of those movies that cheers you up if you are having a bad day. The duo of McCarthy and Silverman is almost flawless. They are wonderful to watch. Together they almost remind me of classic pairs like Laurel & Hardy or Abbot & Costello. If you just sit back and relax this movie can really tickle your funny bone. It even might make you `drop dead from laughing'. Oh.was that to corny.sorry. But honestly, this is a good film. Give it a try someday when you have nothing else to do or are having a party. (But beware just rent this one. The second one, although it has its moments, doesn't meet up to the original)",
         "Many will say Weekend at Bernie's is a comedy, but is it really? This review will contain SPOILERS, so discontinue reading if you do not wish to know the story. The tragic anti-hero is Bernie, a man who seemingly has it all. He has a great NYC apartment, a house at the beach, a boat, a high-priced sports car, women falling at his feet, and a great toupee. He is the symbol of 1980s material success. Any of us would love to be in his position, right? Perhaps not, for all great tragedies possess a fall from grace. Bernie is successful because of his involvement in the NYC organized crime underground. This combined with his lack of self-control in regards to the Don's girlfriend results in his untimely end. The tragedy is this: in death, no one notices. Bernie's supposed \"friends\" continue to use his boat, party at his house, drink his booze, and yet no one realizes he is dead. The woman who indirectly caused his death defiles and molests his corpse without noticing. This is an insult not only to his person, but his sexual prowess as well. It would seem Bernie lacked any real emotional attachments. Instead, he plunged himself into the seedy world of 1980s materialism. It was this world that would not only cause his death, but would also insult his humanity through the implication that his life was irrelevant. Indeed, Bernie became in death what he could not attain in life, a hero. While dead, Bernie's corpse protects two losers from meeting their own untimely ends at the hands of both the New York mafia and Neptune's realm. In death, Bernie was able to give pleasure to all those around him through his possessions and, in the case of his girlfriend, his body. However philanthropy and necrophilia aside, all of these redeeming acts are meaningless because when those around him find out that he is really dead, some do not believe while others express shock. However the shock is not from losing a dear friend, but from the realization that they were too absorbed in their material lifestyle to take notice of the recently departed. The tale of Bernie is a tragic one. A man unloved in life and death, let his story guide you. For it is not the material success that brings one happiness and love, rather it is the depth of friendship.",
         "This is a great \"black humour\" comedy - I gave it 9 out of 10. Judging by the low rating most of the people here are giving it - they \"can't handle the truth\". Maybe that's because most of the people are constantly brained washed by Hollywood type comedies - sweet and romantic or alternatively rude and full of body parts /smells/sounds/etc. But wait - those comedies also have to \"educate\" us, always at the end of the movie, with a \"deeper message\" - the meaning of life, love, god, peace and happiness to all the world, blah, blah, blah... So for those of you that have to have a deeper meaning - did you noticed how many real friends, one that will noticed that he is dead, for instance, Bernie had? Maybe life in the fast lane is not as glamorous as it seems...",
         "Hilarious, totally off the wall black comedy about two buddies (Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman) whose boss, Bernie, has been bumped off by gangsters but whose death goes unrecognized the entire weekend by his self-centered beach friends. Utterly tasteless, goofy, ridiculous, wonderfully funny movie with loads of quirky characters. Andrew McCarthy at his most charmingly loopy and Jonathan Silverman terrific as his straight arrow buddy. Great turn by Terry Kiser as Bernie, who will not go away or play dead. Ridiculous situations that are just plain fun to watch. A movie to remember with delight and to enjoy at a repeat viewing.",
         "\"Weekend at Bernie's\" is a hilarious film about two losers (Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy) who stumble onto a plan by some unknown person in their company to steal from the corporation. They tell the boss, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), and it turns out that he is the culprit. Now he wants the two of them killed, but his wandering eyes make him the target of the assassin. Bernie invites the two losers out to his beach-house in the hopes of them being eliminated. However, he is killed instead and when Silverman and McCarthy discover his body they pretend like he is still alive so they can get the great weekend that their late boss promised them. A truly original idea carries this film which is sick in one sense, but amazingly funny in another. Silverman and McCarthy make a surprisingly effective comedy team. However it is Terry Kiser, in one of the most under-rated roles ever seen during the history of the cinema, that makes the film work as well as it can. His uncanny ability to play a stiff corpse for nearly the whole film is truly revolutionary. If there was ever a performance that was overlooked by the Academy, it may be Kiser's role here (do not laugh). Overall the film over-achieves and is well-worth watching at least once. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",
         "This movie is great from start to finish. The characters are well developed and Andrew McCarthy(The Joy Luck Club) and Jonathan Silverman(The Single Guy) play wonderfully off of each other. The Dialogue was better then that of any modern made comedy I have seen. This is a dark comedy but for the family which is something I have never seen done before. This movie is unique and over the head of anyone who didn't like it.",
         "I first saw this film at about 2:00am one morning and knew that I had to have it. Okay, so it's a one joke movie, but hey it is still incredibly funny. It is a film that encapsulates the eighties and the two lead roles are perfect. The actor who played Bernie's corpse deserves an oscar as although he doesn't say a single word it honestly seems he is dead!! Classic moments include Bernie waterskiing and Bernie making love to his girlfriend (he is of course dead in both scenes.) A must for anyone who wants a good laugh.",
         "There is really nothing funny about a dead man and his corpse. Yet occasionally corpses happen to be the subject of humor. There was the amusing film (based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel) THE WRONG BOX, which was elegantly done, and was quite good. There was Alfred Hitchcock's attempt at a totally funny black comedy regarding hiding a dead body in New England, called THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY. And best of all was this 1989 comedy about a body that takes on a \"life\" of it's own. Hitchcock's fans insist THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is one of his greatest films. It isn't. It demonstrates that Hitchcock's sense of humor was best used as a seasoning. A good example: in FRENZY the trouble the Scotland Yard Inspector had with his wife's \"continental\" cooking attempts. Every now and then the action leaves the scenes involving the suspect and the real killer and the victims, and we watch the poor Inspector discussing the case with his wife (who makes some good suggestions) while they eat all sorts of concoctions that the poor man loathes. It is not a bad running joke - but it is not the main theme of the film. The main theme of THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was that a number of people in a New England town all have had problems with Harry. The joke is how each of these people tries to hide the corpse, alone or with each other. They are helped by the stupidity of the local sheriff. The problem is that Hitch's originality and inventiveness began to fade in the film. After all, how many times can you show people hiding a body and make it funny? And this was the actual plot - not a sideline to the plot. In THE WRONG BOX there were other strands (the antics of Michael Caine, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock, Ralph Richardson, and John Mills in different directions - frequently at cross purposes). The fact the body gets mislaid, when it is at the center of the plot of Cook and Moore, concerning a tontine. The corresponding scheme of Mills trying to get rid of his rival Richardson for the tontine. In short the body is an element, but not the center of the joke. WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S changed this. The corpse is the center and movement of the plot, but screenplay writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotchoff realized what THE WRONG BOX showed, and what Hitch missed. The key of the use of a dead body as a matter of humor is not hiding the body, but producing it. In THE WRONG BOX it is hidden by various people, for different reasons, but several (Cook and Moore) plan to produce it at a given moment - and can't. In short the body has movement despite being a body. Hitch just kept having the body of Harry dug up and moved to another grave several times - movement it's true, but repetitive movement at best. One exception, but a meaningless one - when Harry's body is put into the bathtub in Shirley MacLaine's house. Why should it be in the tub? Hitch never really gave a reasonable reason for that. In WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S Klane and Kotchoff solved this by creating the necessity of making people believe the dead Bernie is not dead. Terry Kaiser is Bernie Lomax, the head of a large company that Andrew McCarthy (as Larry Waters) and Jonathan Silverman (as Richard Parker) work for as accountants. They discover a huge discrepancy in the books, and make the mistake of trusting this information to Bernie. They don't realize he and his partner have been looting the company. Bernie invites them to his home in the Hamptons for the weekend (where he secretly plans to bump them off). What he does not realize is that his partner has decided to bump him off, so Don Calfa (as Pacho, the hit-man) shoots Bernie, and leaves his corpse in the house. He thinks that the two visitors or someone else will report the finding of the dead body. When Waters and Parker show up, they discover the dead man, and they are aware of his plot against them. Should they call the police? They decide they would be suspected. So the best thing is to make it appear that Bernie is still alive, and that he is having an active, fun-filled weekend with the two fellows. With plenty of people seeing and \"speaking\" to Bernie during the weekend, they will make sure that when they leave, nobody will suspect them. Of course, as time passes, Pacho can't understand the failure of anyone to discover the murder. He keeps returning and \"killing\" the living Bernie again and again and again. But Bernie keeps surviving to be seen limboing, swimming, and even water-skiing (my favorite part of the film). From a comedy about a dead body it becomes a comedy about frustration for the gunman, and of inventiveness by the two young heroes. It also is a smörgåsbord of prat falls, blows to the head, and unnatural natural accidents for actor Terry Kaiser. His performance as the all too lively when dead Bernie is one of the funniest silent comic jobs in recent movies, as his semi-smile and sunglasses make him seem crocked more than dead to everyone dancing on the beach front at his house. It is certainly more interesting than that of the actor who was \"Harry\" in Hitch's film - who just had to lay on the ground or get carried somewhere. Again, a clever grasp of the possibilities of the situation in reverse, in a well written and directed film like BERNIE'S, beats out the unimaginative use of the corpse as a simple prop even if the director is (otherwise) a master of cinema elsewhere."
