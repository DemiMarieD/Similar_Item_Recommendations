      "synopsis": "The movie opens with an incident on the island of Isla Sorna (code-named \"Site B\" by the InGen company), located in the vicinity of Isla Nublar, where the film \"Jurassic Park\" took place. A British couple has stopped along the coast to relax, and their daughter has gone off on her own. She soon encounters a group of Compsognathus or \"Compies,\" that attack her, much to the shock of her family when they find her after hearing her scream loudly. The film then cuts to Ian Malcolm, who is called to the Mansion of John Hammond, the \"former\" head of InGen. Malcolm meets Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim there, whom he encountered on Isla Nublar in the first film. Malcolm also meets Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who has taken over InGen as its new Chief Executive Officer. Both trade barbs over the aftermath of the incidents at Jurassic Park, with Malcolm chastising Ludlow for covering up what really happened, and Ludlow claiming Malcolm went public telling stories (of which Malcolm counters he told the truth but took no payment for what he revealed). Malcolm then is allowed to visit Hammond, who is now bed-ridden. Malcolm is soon shocked when Hammond tells him about Site B. Isla Nublar was the location for Jurassic Park, but Site B was where the animals were originally created and bred. However, in the aftermath of Hurricane Clarissa, Site B was evacuated and the animals let loose to roam free, with them inhabiting an environment free of human interference. This shocks Malcolm as he had assumed that the dinosaurs should have died, since they were bred with a lysine deficiency, that needed to be supplied by medical means. Hammond explains he has no idea why they are still alive, and shocks Malcolm when he explains that a research team has been recruited to conduct studies on this subject, and that brings him to Malcolm, who Hammond wants to be the 4th member of the team. Hammond then explains that after the incidents at Jurassic Park, InGen has been on the verge of Chapter 11 bankruptcy for some time, with the Board wanting to exploit the remaining dinosaurs on Site B for profit purposes. Hammond was able to keep them from doing so until the incident with the British Family. After this, control of InGen was taken away from Hammond, and he explains that his plans for the research team are seen as a possible deterrent for whatever his nephew Peter has planned. Malcolm (of course) refuses Hammond's offer, and plans to make sure that the research team does not set foot on the island. However, he soon finds that his former girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) has already arrived, with the additional members to meet her in 3 days. Malcolm then leaves planning to rescue Sarah from Site B. Malcolm's next stop is a garage owned by Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff), who has been prepping vehicles and equipment for the expedition. Malcolm also meets Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughan), who was planning to take video and photographic footage for Hammond's expedition. Malcolm is soon after joined by his daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester). Kelly wants to come along on the expedition, but Malcolm explains she can't go, and the two have a small altercation before Malcolm sends her on her way, telling her 'not to listen to him.' Malcolm, Eddie and Nick transport two Mercedes SUV's and a modified RV to Costa Rica, and then head to Site B. However, the ferryman refuses to weight anchor near the islands, claiming that some people wandered too close to the island chain and were never heard from again. Through translation, Nick explains that the islands are known as Los Cinco Muertes (\"The Five Deaths\"). Once on the island, Eddie, Malcolm and Nick locate Sarah using a homing beacon on her backpack. They encounter her taking pictures of a herd of Stegosaurus, with Sarah seeming to be perfectly fine. Shortly after meeting up with her, smoke can be seen from the direction of the RV, and the group finds that Kelly has stowed away. This surprise is short-lived as suddenly, a fleet of InGen helicopters can be seen flying in vehicles and equipment. The team is headed up by Peter Ludlow, and led by Roland Tembo, a big-game hunter who is leading the expedition to round up various dinosaurs for InGen. After the capture assignment is completed, Roland heads off to try and kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex, which he considers his fee for the assignment. Roland instead finds an infant Tyrannosaur, and has it chained, with the hope that its cries will bring its parents back. Meanwhile, Ludlow has arranged a satellite uplink to InGen's boardroom, where he is attempting to drum up a sales pitch for InGen's latest plan to get itself out of Chapter 11: take John Hammond's dream of a Jurassic Park, but build it in a more convenient place. Ludlow tells of his dream for Jurassic Park: San Diego, when suddenly, the encampment is attacked by the dinosaurs that were caged moments ago (having been freed by Nick Van Owen and the others). On his way back to the RV, Nick finds the infant Tyrannosaur, and noting that it seems injured, talks Sarah into taking it back to the RV to be mended. Once back at the RV, Kelly notes that the Rex is making sounds that could attract other animals. Wanting to be somewhere safe, Malcolm has Eddie take Kelly into a special perched cage high up in the trees some ways off. As they look out over the trees, a familiar sound reaches Malcolm's ears, and he then heads back to the RV. Soon after, the Tyrannosaurs come for their infant, and it is returned to them. However, they then proceed to push the RV off the nearby cliffside. Eddie heads to their rescue and manages to save Malcolm, Sarah and Nick, but not before he is eaten by the Rexes. The group soon meets up with Ludlow and Roland's groups, and now have to work together to get off the island. The only way to radio for communications now is at the main facility in the interior of the island. Ludlow warns them that it will be dangerous, because of scans having shown that Velociraptors are located in the island interior. The group then sets out for the interior of the island. One evening, very close to their destination, the T-Rexes happen to find them. As the female chases after one group, Roland attempts to kill the male. However, he soon finds that someone has removed the shells from his gun, and he instead uses tranquilizers to take down the male. In the confusion, some men scatter into a field of tall-grass, where they are taken down by velociraptors hiding in the field. Malcolm, Kelly, Sarah and Nick end up making their way to the abandoned main facility. While Nick radios for a rescue team, Malcolm, Sarah and Kelly end up trying to fend off a group of raptors that have chased them into the facility. They manage to escape (along with Nick) when a helicopter arrives at the facility. As the helicopter takes off, they see that a group has also come for Roland, Peter Ludlow, and some of the remaining survivors. The crew has also had a giant cage rigged to transport the tranquilized male T-Rex to a waiting ship. Both groups arrive in San Diego, California, where Malcolm and Sarah quickly head to InGen's waterfront facility, where Ludlow has arranged a last-minute press conference to herald the arrival of the male T-Rex as the main attraction for the still-in-construction Jurassic Park: San Diego. However, instead of going smoothly, the ship the creature is on crashes into the docks. Ludlow, Malcolm, Sarah and some workers go aboard, only to find dismembered pieces of the crew, and the cage with the Rex broken apart. Suddenly, the doors to the cargo hold burst open, and the male T-Rex emerges, making his way off the ship and into the city of San Diego. Sarah and Malcolm soon find a surviving crew member who explains that after they were in transport of the T-Rex, it stopped breathing, so an additional drug was given. However, being unfamiliar with the T-Rex, proper dosage was not known. Because of this, the animal is dehydrated. Sarah figures that the T-Rex will first find water and then look for food. They receive word that Ludlow brought the infant Tyrannosaur as well, and transported it in his personal jet to the still-in-construction park. The two head there to retrieve it, in hopes to use it to lure the T-Rex back to the docks. After recovering the infant, the two find the T-Rex rampaging through the city. upon hearing and smelling the infant, the t-Rex follows the Malcolm and Sarah back to the docks. Ludlow, upon hearing what has happened, orders that the adult male be shot, and that the infant be recovered. When he sees Malcolm and Sarah carrying the infant to the cargo ship, he quickly follows, only to find the infant in the cargo hold. Ludlow attempts to lure the infant out, but soon after, the adult male enters the hold, and injures Ludlow, before allowing the infant to kill him. Sarah then launches a tranquilizer dart at the T-Rex, which subdues it as Malcolm closes the hold's doors. In the aftermath, the Navy and a new crew escort the ship back to Isla Sorna, as Malcolm and Sarah rest in front of the TV. John Hammond also releases a statement requesting that with InGen's secret island of dinosaurs now being realized, that Costa Rica help establish the island as a nature preserve, to keep humans from setting foot on it.",

         "My Rating: *** out of ****. I dont understand all the horrible reviews for this film. Sure not a great film, but definitely a good, entertaining movie. I enjoyed it just as much as the first Jurassic Park. The Lost World still contains impressive, eye popping effects. These are just as flawless as the CGI as the first Jurassic Parks. There are more dinosaurs and they all look great. The film contains more action than the first and its all exciting. One scene that stands out is the scene with the Raptors in the fields. I love the way Spielberg shot it. This is not a big acting movie, but its not that bad. Jeff Goldblum is good as Ian Malcolm, but had a little more energy in the first one. Julianne Moore is adequate but looks a bit uncomfortable at times. Vanessa Lee Chester is better than the other kids in the last film. The rest of the acting is adequate. Many people thought this film was redundant of the first. I wouldnt call it redundant but it is a little bit too familiar in areas. The Lost World takes place in a different area but it is not much different from the first one. However, it is an entertaining movie. The action overshadows the story. The big problem I have with The Lost World is the ending. It doesnt make sense how The T-Rex got loose. Its also a King Kong Rip-Off. Its visually stunning looking, the TREX doesnt look out of place at all. But it was showing CGI instead of doing something with the story. Nevertheless, even with its flaws The Lost World is entertaining and not worthy of its horrible reviews.",
         "Where Jurassic Park succeeded by showing us a world that had been limited to our imagination, \"The Lost World\" fails due to the lack of imagination of the screenwriter, hack extraordinaire David Koepp. I can't imagine anyone reads these things without expecting to hear plot points; however I will warn you that there are spoilers in this review. It was pretty obvious that this movie was in trouble when Sam Neill refused to come back. This is nothing against Jeff Goldblum - he is a great actor, and certainly has the presence to carry a movie. But here he is saddled with quite a few problems. First, the screenplay is terrible. There is only one sympathetic character - Richard Schiff's Eddie Carr - and he is killed off rather early. You are left to pick your hero from among these likeable characters: - Julianne Moore - an actress of whom I am not fond - playing a know-it-all paleontologist who cannot act in a coherent, logical manner. At the beginning of the movie, she actually pets a dinosaur, then admonishes the others for getting near them. \"We musn't disturb them!\" she states. Then, against all scientific wisdom, she takes a wounded baby T-Rex, whining and howling, into the camp. The results, like the movie, are predictable - Vince Vaughn as Nick Van Owen, a Greenpeace hippie so stupid he actually takes bullets out of peoples' guns, resulting in a lot of \"he's going to save that guy by shooting the dinosaur ... no, wait, the hippie got to his gun! Horray for nature!\" And then another character gets eaten. - Jeff Goldblum, mugging for the camera at every opportunity. Again, a funny, capable actor, but with nothing to work with here - Malcolm's daughter, who is for some reason black (never explained, and apparently only part of the script so someone can make the \"no family resemblance\" joke). She mainly screams and chastises daddy for not keeping his promises All of this is the product of Mr. Hack, David \"Panic Room\" Koepp. The screenplay is all over the place. First there are the errors in scientific reasoning and basic character behavior listed above. Some might think, \"who cares?\" Well, I do, dammit. If you're going to write a dinosaur movie, is it so rough to write a good one? This trash isn't even camp - camp is winking at the audience. This script is just junk. Let me list a few plotholes: - How did the daughter manage to stay aboard the trailer during its entire time of transit and nobody noticed her? - Why did the daughter build a fire outside, when the trailer has all the comforts of a modern home inside? - Why are all of the large weapons discarded after the first dinosaur attack? - Why are none of the soldiers aware of what they are facing, so they can do stupid things like run from T-Rexes, wear headphones during life-or-death situations, and generally act like a bunch of redshirts? - How, exactly, did the dinosaurs on the ship kill the entire crew, keep the ship steered perfectly towards the harbor, then seal themselves back into the cargo hold? - How did the dinosaurs on the friggin' ship escape? They were all in containers! Are we supposed to believe all of the containment failed, or that one dinosaurs got out and selflessly released all the other ones? - Why didn't the \"world's most deadly neurotoxin\" have ANY effect on the T-Rex? The answer to all of these questions: the screenwriter is terrible. David Koepp seems to completely forget the sci-fi surrounding in which his characters are immersed, glossing over HUGE areas of potential interest to get to: family conflict. That's right! See the daughter chastise daddy for not being around! See mom talk about how she \"needs her space\". Isn't that why you go to see a dinosaur movie - to hear people working out their personal issues? There really isn't anything to recommend this movie. The scenes in San Diego are particularly ridiculous. Koepp tries to go for some form of light comedy - \"Mommy, there's a dinosaur in the backyard!\" - instead of the true carnage we all wanted to see. Even Jurassic Park III - with Tea Leoni stinking up the screen and screaming at the drop of a hat, and that annoying little kid - was better than this at providing sheer thrills and excitement.",
         "I saw this in a theater in 1997 and I thought I liked it. I just saw it again on DVD last night, and I now I know I do. What I can't figure out is why so many people think it's so horrible. After seeing JP III a few weeks ago, I still think The Lost World is better. Of course the original is the best, but The Lost World is packed with suspense, witty dialogue (especially Goldblum's), and of course, the usual great looking dinosaurs. There are a few things I don't like, the gymnastics routine towards the end being at the top of the list. But other than that and a few silly lines, this movie is almost as thrilling as the first. Personally, I don't care if the plot of this one is weak. I've never even really given that any thought. The first 100 minutes or so are loaded with excitement, then the finale with the T-Rex in the city is, if you ask me, played mostly for laughs. Yes it's like Godzilla, and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, but that's the point. It's like those movies but with 21st century (almost) special effects. And it's just plain fun to see this dinosaur stomping through the suburbs, drinking from a swimming pool and, wreaking havoc at gas station minimart. I think if you don't take the San Diego scenes too seriously, and look at it as Spielberg's way of paying homage to *and* poking fun at the Godzilla-type movies, you can appreciate this portion of the movie. Then to wrap it all up with Bernard Shaw from CNN, and an obvious open door to a sequel - what more could you ask for? Well, maybe a better plot as some people seem to be saying, but I think this is a great popcorn movie and it works for me.",
         "You have a bunch of idiots on an island populated by carnivorous dinosaurs. One dude gets eaten alive by these little pirhana-like creatures while he's taking a whiz because he doesn't have sense enough to stay close to his party. Brilliant. I don't suppose it ever occurred to these idiots that meat eating also included human flesh if it was around when the dinosaurs were really alive. Then you have a bunch of people running around in the grass, knowing that there are grass raptors around. Again, brilliant. Where did these people get their science degrees? K-Mart Blue Light Special? Some dingbat picks up a baby tyrannosaurus rex because it has a broken leg and takes it to her lab to treat it. Uh..excuse me. That baby has a momma. And momma won't be very happy to see some human with her baby. Not content with all this silliness, they have to top themselves and, as far as I'm concerned, win the all-time prize for being stupid in a no stupid zone. They put a tyrannosaurus rex on a ship bound from Costa Rica to San Diego. Did they really think there was a cargo hold that could hold that creature for very long? And to add insult to injury, they have this same creature terrorizing the streets of San Diego. \"Mom! Dad! There is a dinosaur in our back yard.\" Right. Go back to sleep, kid. And then he eats the dog? And drinks out of the swimming pool? This brings me to a dumb question. What effect would drinking chlorinated water have on a tyrannosaurus rex? Okay, enough of this foolishness. This movie was stupid, and the so-called scientists did not show an ounce of common sense. And neither did the script writers. 1 out of 10.",
         "First of all, let me start of by saying that I am a huge Jurassic Park fan. However, this movie was just awful for so many reasons. I surely didn't expect such crap from Spielberg. It's all the annoying little things that they make us put up with just so they shoot some pre-planned action shots or hopefully make it into a ride at Universal. 1. How would Malcolm's daughter sneak into the camper in the first place, wouldn't he say goodbye to her before departing. 2. What the hell was she doing at the construction site in the first place. 3. Could they have picked a more confusing person to be his daughter, how about a pair of Siamese twins that were attached by the head. 4. Could anyone possibly believe that Malcolm just happens to be dating or in love with the one person in the world that needs to go on the island first(Julianne Moore). 5. An expert in the field (Julianne Moore) would be dumb enough to bring a baby T-Rex into the camper. 6. Malcolm's daughter just happens to want to go somewhere really high & that 1 piece of equipment is available. Most of the characters especially Julianne Moore as just horribly miscast and seem really out of character. .....this is as far as I have gotten & I just can't stomach any more of this. Shame of Spielberg for making this.",
         "Okay, the best Jurassic Park is obviously Jurassic Park. It was the most faithful to the fantastic Michael Critchton books, plus it was well done. As a sequel, The Lost World does just fine. Of course, I'm used to seeing horrible sequels all the time. Jeff Goldblum does a good job reprising his role as Ian Malcolm, and the newcomers of Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn do well too. The story is a little unbelievable, though. After recently being replaced by his nephew as CEO of InGen, John Hammond(Richard Attenburough) reveals to Ian Malcolm(Goldblum) a site B: A place where dinosaurs run free. He sends him and his girlfriend, Sarah Harding(Moore), technology expert Eddie Carr(Richard Schiff) and photographer Nick Van Owen(Vaughn) to document the dinosaurs, while the official InGen team, led by Roland Tembo(Pete Postlethwaite), tries to capture the T. Rex and transport it to San Diego. As always, there is many bone-crunching deaths, the Special FX are excellent, but the story and plot fall a a bit short. Overall: 7/10",
         "It has been four years since Jurassic Park was destroyed and the island Isla Nublar itself was drowned by a hurricane killing most of the dinosaurs; now there is a new island (called Isla Sorna) that has been genetically engineering the same animals, but abandoned the project after the company InGen declared bankruptcy. The film's short prologue introduces a rich family who are trying to enjoy their vacation on the beach of Isla Sorna, but their little girl wanders off into the jungles of the beach where she encounters a small dinosaur called a Compy in which she assumes it's a friendly creature, but turns out to have little friends of its own when they start pecking body parts of her off screen. Jurassic Park survivor Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) returns to John Hammond (Richard Attenbrouogh) after being called upon. This time Hammond wants Malcolm to send in a team of specialists to go in and document the island where he wants to show the world that the dinosaurs are safe and not dangerous animals. Malcolm finds out that his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already on the island and doesn't realize what she's getting into. With the team on the island, they track down Sarah and realize that Malcolm has another surprise that his daughter Kelly has sneaked in one of the trailers and disobeyed her father's orders of staying on the mainland. Another team is on the island not to document but to capture and retrieve the animals to make a zoo. The team is lead by Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard in a bad English accent) who wants to make a profit after the company InGen suffers a lost in profit and damage from the original Jurassic Park. He gets a big game hunter name Roland Tembo (Pete Postelwaite) who wants to bag a Tyrannosaurus Rex as his trophy. The Lost World: Jurassic Park is great entertainment; the special effects are twice worthy than the original. Though I find this film more frightening than the original, it reminds me of the film \"Aliens\" where the suspense gets bigger and twice as scary as the original.",
         "The Lost World is the sequel to the 1993 classic Jurassic Park. Whilst this film is not as good as the original it does stand up well as a sequel. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm has been asked to return to another Island were Dinosaurs have been allowed to live without cages. Malcolm refuses but when he finds out his paleontolagist girlfriend is already there he goes with a team of documentariens to rescue her. However several accidents ensue and they are left stranded on the Island with a second party. The film does not have the all round strength of the first and is far more dependant on thrills and its visual effects this time round. It does however succeed as good entertainment and its better than the third installment in the franchise by quite a bit. The Dino sequences are handled well with the Raptors in the long grass being the highlight of those and quite possibly the entire film. The T-rex features strongly again ( and this time there's two of them) along with a new and nasty little green dinosaur compsagnathus. The acting is'nt Oscar worthy or anything like it but the characters do have some charm and when they are put in danger you care what happens to them which is always a good sign. It does suffer a little from a bloated and anti climatic ending that is funny for about 2 minutes but I wont spoil it for you none the less. I give the Lost World its high rating because it does exactly what it sets out to do, entertain us. So I think its fair we overlook some of its flaws as with any kind of blockbuster sequel they are always there.",
         "After the massive success of Jurassic Park, it was pretty clear that a sequel wouldn't be 65 million years in the making; but just because it had less time to evolve doesn't excuse the fact that The Lost World is an inexcusably sloppy piece of movie-making. Jeff Goldblum returns as eccentric mathematician Ian Malcolm, who travels to dinosaur infested island 'site B' to rescue his researcher girlfriend Sarah Harding (no, not the one from Girls Aloud, but rather the lovely Julianne Moore) who has gone to study the scientifically engineered prehistoric creatures not quite appreciating the dangers she will face. What follows is often spectacular, and sometimes downright brilliant (best bit: Moore falling on to the slowly cracking windshield of a truck suspended hundreds of feet above jagged rocks), but any flashes of genius from director Steven Spielberg are easily negated by some of the dumbest plot developments and unintentionally funny bits it has been my displeasure to witness in a big-budget blockbuster. For starters, there is Malcolm's (African-American?!?!) daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester), who stows on board her father's high tech truck in order to lend the film some kiddy appeal. She provides the film with its most ridiculous moment when she puts her gymnastic skills (conveniently mentioned early on in the film to set up this particular scene) into practise by swinging on some makeshift uneven bars and dismounting with enough force to kick a velociraptor to its death. And she's almost as dreadful in the part where good old T-Rex sticks its huge head into her tent, and she wakes up to ask 'What is that?'. Take a wild guess, sweetie! Then there's the gob-smackingly silly scene where one character is so scared of the snake that slithers into his shirt that he'd rather leave the safety of a cave and be eaten by the dinosaur that has been waiting outside. And let's not forget the fact that a captured T-Rex manages to escape from its cage on a boat, eat everyone on board, and then get trapped back in the hold. Or the daft ending, which has Malcolm and Harding lure the king of the tyrant lizards, fresh from a Godzilla style rampage, back into captivity by using its baby as bait. With all this unintentional hilarity, The Lost World can only be seen as a major disappointment, but I suppose we should at least be grateful that there wasn't a nuclear-blast proof fridge in the film, 'cos that would be really stupid!",
         "The Lost World was a film which had to reach a very high standard. following the impressive Jurassic Park which pioneered the consistent use of CGI and arguably one of film's most symbolic creatures, T-Rex. Because of this a pretty good film was slated. In one sense justifiably so as the Lost World could never compare to the first instalment in the franchise. It was always going to be an impossible task to improve on the first film which had so much going for it and unsurprisingly it is not the best film in the world. In some respects this film does shoot itself in the foot. The end sequence is silly, there are numerous unexplored errors and for the raptor fans, they get a pretty raw deal. Furthermore the Lost World continued on the premise that children would be able to survive a dinosaur attack while mercenaries with guns could not... If you leave these issues aside the Lost World is a respectable movie and no matter how many times I watch it does entertain. What I liked was that unlike Jurassic Park 3, it continued the idea of the dinosaurs being animals rather than monsters. Apart from the Raptors which were just as scary and monstrous as in the first film, none of the animals attack for pleasure or financial gain (compared to the humans in the film). They hunt and kill for their basic needs and instincts. One could say that the film follows an ecological route, and criticises all corporate involvement in animal exploitation. Plot wise, The Lost World is basically an add on to the first film. We find out that there is another island other than Isla Nublar with dinosaurs called Isla Sorna and the now bankrupt Ingen wants to harvest the island in order to ship the dinosaurs back to the mainland. Hammond, who had recently lost control of the company, however disapproves of this and so decides to construct a team to document the animals in order to gain public support for their conservation. He tries to recruit first film survivor Ian Malcolm who initially refuses. However when Malcolm finds out his girlfriend Dr.Harding has already gone to the island on her own he decides to rescue her. What transpires is a 2 hour survival movie full of dinosaur attacks, suspense, action and Jeff Goldblum (Malcolm) attempting sarcasm along the way. While the sarcasm may grate after a while the movie does have some great one liners: Nick:\"Hammond's check cleared or I wouldn't be going on this wild goose chase\". Malcolm: \"Well your going to the only place in the world where the geese chase you\" Similarily while the plot isn't that complicated the characters are enjoyable. Malcolm is definitely the funniest with his sarcastic one liners (see above). Roland played by Pete Posthelwaite (a surprising casting as I would not expect to see him in a Hollywood action movie) is especially good as the cold, yet human hunter character in the film. The only annoying character is surprise, surprise Malcolm's daughter Kelly, who despite spending almost the entire film screaming and whining about the least bit thing (stereotype teenager), is brave enough to do a complicated gymnastic routine inside a derelict house on rusty bars to kick a Raptor through a window. It is an annoying trait in Jurassic Park that in every film there is always an annoying kid. Interestingly when compared to the book the film is does a good job. Jurassic Park the film was nowhere near as good as the novel but there is a definite improvement over the Lost World Novel in this film. Not saying the book was bad (or for that matter the first film), it was just that I enjoyed the film a lot more. My advice is to watch the film before you read the book. While the book has its moments don't expect it to be a repeat of Crichton's classic first novel. Additionaly the CGI and models come back with avengence!!! As you'd expect after 4 years of development the dinosaurs look better than ever, and still look pretty impressive. Certainly this film has aged pretty well. The moving models have improved as well. Supposedly both T-Rex's in Lost World contained twice the equipment of the previous T-Rex from the first film. Lost World looks great and as you would expect from a Spielberg film, has great production values. Locations look sublime with the coniferous forests, tall grass and no fencing making the new island look and feel like a true lost world rather than a science experiment. Finally I personally loved the look of the vehicles. Certainly this is not a film which will disappoint (or unlike the JP III will confuse you)with its look and feel and as stated before has great production values. All in all, this is a severely underrated film which was always going to be slated if it was not 100% as good as its predecessor. It is not as good as Jurassic Park but the Lost World is definitely a film you can enjoy. Certainly it will entertain you for its 2 hour duration and has always been a personal favourite. So its unsurprising that I was overjoyed to see it move ahead of the disastrous Jurassic III in the IMDb polls. A well deserved result."

         "Four years after the failure of Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, John Hammond reveals to Ian Malcolm that there was another island (\"Site B\") on which dinosaurs were bred before being transported to Isla Nublar. Left alone since the disaster, the dinosaurs have flourished, and Hammond is anxious that the world see them in their \"natural\" environment before they are exploited.",
         "Ian Malcolm is recruited by John Hammond to lead a research team to Isla Sorna, an island 87 miles to the south of Isla Nublar (the site of the original Jurassic Park). Here, InGen Bioengineering had constructed the secret \"Site B\", where the dinosaurs were actually bred and then transported to the park. Hammond's nephew, who has taken control of InGen, leads his own team to the island to capture the dinos and bring them back to the U.S. to become attractions at a \"dino park\" in San Diego. The dinos cause havoc and have a field day with the movable \"feast.\"",
         "With the apparent public discovery of the 'Site B' production island full of dinosaurs, John Hammond assembles a team to visit and document the area before it is exploited by others. Included in the four man team are Dr. Ian Malcolm and his girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding. When the team reaches the island, they soon discover the presence of another group of people. This new group however are not there for biological data but instead have something more sinister in mind. After a series of events, both groups become stranded when all their communication equipment is lost. It is then that the terror really begins as both groups scramble for their lives.",
         "The film picks up four years after the disaster at Jurassic Park. On a nearby island, dinosaurs have secretly survived and been allowed to roam free but now there is a more ominous threat--a plan to capture and bring the dinosaurs to the mainland. John Hammond, who has lost control of his InGen company, sees a chance to redeem himself for his past mistakes and sends an expedition led by Ian Malcolm to reach the island before the mercenary team gets there. The two groups confront each other in the face of extreme danger and must team up for their own survival in a race against time.",
