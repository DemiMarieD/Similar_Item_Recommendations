      "synopsis": "The bumbling French Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) has been temporarily demoted to beat cop by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who despises Clouseau to the point of obsession. However, the French government forces Dreyfus to reinstate Clouseau as the Inspector of the Sûreté (as they had been planning to anyway, much to Dreyfus' chagrin) so that he can go to the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Lugash to investigate the theft of the fabled Pink Panther diamond, which has once again been stolen. Clouseau's investigation at the Lugash National Museum, which he nearly destroys with his klutzy ways, lead him to believe that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the notorious Phantom, is re-creating the most infamous heist of his career. Clouseau is delighted at this, and sees this as his only chance to get his revenge on Litton for framing him and temporarily sending him to prison (in the first Pink Panther film). Although Clouseau fails to uncover any leads into the theft, his bumbling allows him to survive several attempts on his life by a mysterious assassin. After staking out, and nearly demolishing, the Litton Manor in Nice, Clouseau is tricked into leaving France. He follows Sir Charles' wife, Lady Claudine (Catherine Schell) to a resort hotel in Gstaad, Switzerland, where his attempts to investigate her repeatedly fail. Meanwhile in England, Sir Charles reads about the theft and realizes that he has been framed. He goes to Lugash to investigate, encountering various underworld figures of old acquaintance, and foils several attempts on his life. Litton eventually manages to discover that the thief of the diamond is his wife, Lady Claudine. Because they were both bored with their quiet retirement, she stole the diamond for her own excitement, then sent her husband on a wild goose chase for his. Sir Charles makes a daring escape from Lugash and goes to Gstaad to find his wife and the diamond to clear his name. Inspector Clouseau, who has unknowingly been on the trail of the real thief all along, receives a telephone call from Chief Inspector Dreyfus telling him to arrest Lady Claudine. However, when Clouseau calls Dreyfus back to ask why, he is informed that Dreyfus has been on vacation for the past week. Dreyfus, now revealed as the assassin trying to kill Clouseau, prepares to shoot him with a sniper rifle as soon as he enters Lady Claudine's room. Lady Claudine playfully confesses the theft to her husband, and hands the diamond over to him, so he can go about proving his innocence. They are cornered by Colonel Sharky (Peter Arne) of the Lugash Secret Police, who intends to kill both of them. It turns out he has been using the theft of the diamond as an excuse to purge his political opponents. Just then, Clouseau barges into the room to arrest the Littons. Sir Charles points out that Colonel Sharky is going to kill them all. Suddenly, Dreyfus opens fire on the room, and manages to accidentally kill Sharky while aiming at Clouseau, who has ducked at the last minute to check his fly. During the fray, Clouseau is forced to allow the Littons to escape. For his work in recovering the Pink Panther, Clouseau is promoted to Chief Inspector, and vows to bring Sir Charles, who has resumed his crime spree, to justice. (Note: Lady Claudine's fate is not revealed, but it is implied she was not arrested.) Dreyfus is committed to a lunatic asylum, where he is straitjacketed and placed inside a rubber room, vowing revenge on Clouseau.",

         "I very much enjoy this installment of the series. Not very fond of any of the others. The Return of the Pink Panther just has it all in my opinion. You get a crime story, funny/stupid humor, Clouseau who still has no idea of what's going on(this just makes the movie what it is). The fight between Clouseau and Kato in the apartment is hilarious. One has to wonder how long Kato was waiting in the refrigerator. The fight is just very slapstick and clumsy that it makes me and my girlfriend laugh every time we see it. Another great point of the film is the numerous cars that Clouseau goes through. Loosing a few into a pool. The mental breakdown of Herbert Lom's character is also one of the film's fine points. This is -- my opinion -- the funniest of the series. I have always enjoyed it, and most likely will always enjoy it.",
         "The famous and invaluable diamond known as the Pink Panther is stolen once again from the museum in Lugash, and the authorities decide immediately that to effect the return of this National Treasure they must seek the help of the one man they know will bring the needed expertise to the case: Clouseau. And so it is that `The Return Of The Pink Panther' is entrusted to none other than the inimitable Inspector (Peter Sellers) from France, much to the chagrin of Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), who, knowing what unbridled mayhem Clouseau is really capable of, would like nothing more than to be rid of him once and for all. But such a request from the sovereign authorities of a friendly nation cannot be denied, and Clouseau is therefore dispatched with all haste to Lugash, with orders to bring the criminals to justice, and insure that the case is indeed-- to quote Clouseau-- `solv-ed.' Some ten years had passed since director Blake Edwards and Sellers had teamed up for the brilliant film `A Shot In The Dark,' before coming together once again for this third installment chronicling the misadventures of the `belov-ed' Inspector Clouseau. But the wait was certainly worth it. Cleverly written and delivered, it affords Sellers ample opportunities to do what he does best: Make you laugh. Whether affecting an alias in disguise or forthrightly confronting the usual suspects, Clouseau deftly uncovers every `ploy' attempted by the unscrupulous thieves he seeks. There are moments so hilarious that even co-star Catherine Schell (Claudine) has trouble keeping a straight face at times; but rather than being a distraction (as you'd think it would be), it somehow makes it even funnier. And it's a great example of why this movie is so good, and why it works so well. Simply put, it's fun. Edwards has a formula for success that begins with having a good story at the core, an excellent supporting cast to flesh it all out, then mixing it all together with the main ingredient which is, of course, Sellers. It's one that works, and of which directors of some of the more recent fare being proffered as `comedy' could benefit. Christopher Plummer is well cast as debonair master thief Sir Charles Litton, bringing an air of sophistication to the film that contrasts so well with the antics of Sellers. Characters returning after debuting in `A Shot In The Dark' include the terrific Lom, whose Chief Inspector Dreyfus is the perfect foil for Clouseau; Andre Maranne (Francois); and of course Burt Kwouk as Clouseau's ever-attacking manservant, Cato. The scenes between Sellers and Kwouk, in which they spar at Clouseau's house, are a riot, as is the way Sellers and Lom play off of one another throughout the film (or the series, for that matter); Lom's `reactions' alone to what Sellers is doing are classic bits of comedy. Rounding out the supporting cast are Peter Arne (Colonel Sharky), Peter Jeffrey (General Wadafi), Gregoire Aslan (Chief of Lugash Police), Victor Spinetti (Hotel Concierge) and John Bluthal (Blind Beggar). A number of elements go into making a comedy work, and `The Return Of The Pink Panther' has them all, but most especially, Peter Sellers, who without a doubt is one of the funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen. His comedy works because he always plays it straight and allows the humor to flow naturally from the situation at hand; there's never a laugh that is forced or false. Consider one of the opening scenes in which Clouseau, walking a beat, questions a blind beggar with a monkey about having the proper permits to beg, all while the bank in front of which they are standing is being robbed. There's a purity about it that makes it a joy to watch; the kind of film you can see over and over again and never get tired of. One of the great things about video and DVD is that it affords us the opportunity of cuing up this film-- as well as the other `Panther' movies-- at will. For a lot of laughs, take advantage of the technology at hand and check out Peter Sellers and discover what `classic' comedy is all about. It never gets old, and somehow just keeps getting better with age. I rate this one 9/10.",
         "Peter Sellers is in top form in the Pink Panther Returns as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau. This time around Closeau has been assigned to track down the thief that has stolen the Pink Panther Diamond from the Lugash. All evidence points to the supposedly retired thief the Phantom (also seen in The original Pink Panther but played there by David Niven )aka Charles Lytton. It is in true slapstick style that we see Clouseau bumble through one laugh out loud situation to another in trying to solve the case. Standout scenes include Clouseau going to Charle's Lytton's home posing as a telephone repair man, a runaway vacuum cleaner a fantastic escape by Charles Lytton from some thugs. There are many great moments in this film, and I would highly suggest it not only for a lot of laughs but for the comedic story.",
         "Out of all of the Pink Panther movies this one is my all time favorite. Clouseau is at it again, bungling at his best. His boss who is on the edge for terminating him, indefinitely! And I don't mean by saying \"You're FIRED!\" I mean he's going to kill him! He called everyone aroud him \"idiots\" especially his assistant after he accidentally shoots off his nose. The fight scene between Kato and Clouseau was nothing more than mockery of the matial arts. Other than that I enjoyed every part of the movie. 10. Case CLOSED!",
         "Return of the Pink Panther is an outstanding comedy starring Peter Sellers as the lovable and totally incompetent Inspect Clouseau. I remember seeing this film for the first time just after its release and laughed so hard that my wife refused to sit next to me in the theatre. There are a few slow spots, mainly those without Sellers' charm on screen but there are more than enough belly laughs in this movie to make up for that. Don't miss it.",
         "Return of the Pink Panther (1975) Complete with the great Mancini sax theme, the nutty smart Blake Edwards directing, the sassy cartoon panther himself, and of course Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau (taking on many absurd disguises). This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series (omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini, Sellers, or Edwards), and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yes--it did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012? Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that, like Chaplin, rise above their time. But of course, Sellers, as terrific as he was, was no Charles Chaplin. At his best, the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing, or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material, the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters (including the leading woman, who is totally a late 60s type, not a 1975 type, and she feels oddly unnecessary) don't command their parts, or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery (sort of) of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy, and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one, you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. \"The Pink Panther\" is the original, and at times also a bit sluggish, but it's the first. And \"A Shot in the Dark\" is the best of the three, I think. But if you like them, you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any, you might go in order, since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two, and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward, but decent, third.",
         "SPOILERS With a show stealing turn as bumbling Inspector Clouseau in 1963's \"The Pink Panther\", Peter Sellers was a phenomenon. In 1964, the character was such a success that Sellers would reprise him in the vastly superior \"A Shot In The Dark\". As a result of two wonderful performances as the inept Frenchman, it feels remarkable that it took another 11 years before Sellers would retake the Mantle of the Inspector. When he did though, Sellers put in yet another fine performance as he wandered aimlessly around, causing trouble in his wake. In \"The Return of the Pink Panther\", the famous diamond has one again been stolen. With a glove marked with a \"P\" left at the scene of the crime, Clouseau believes that Sir Charles Litton (David Niven now being replaced by Christopher Plummer) is out of retirement. As Litton travels around the globe to try to clear his name, Clouseau follows with the plan to arrest him. The true beauty of \"The Return of the Pink Panther\" is that director Blake Edwards has learnt the true value of both the brand name and Sellers. By combining countless moments of Clouseau chaos with the Pink Panther brand, Edwards manages to create a film which can be watched over and over again without loss of style or humour. \"The Return of the Pink Panther\" is one of the finest comedies ever made and whilst Plummer feels inferior compared with Niven, the film never looses it's pace and humour. Sellers is screen gold and with him this series of films is joy to watch.",
         "\"The Return of the Pink Panther\" is the fourth movie in the \"Pink Panther\" franchise, marking Peter Sellers' return to what must be his signature role, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Previously, Alan Arkin had stepped into his shoes for one movie, apparently with bad results. In \"Return,\" the fabled Pink Panther diamond is again stolen, with the Phantom's calling card monogrammed glove left as a clue. Clouseau goes back on the case, as does Sir Charles Lytton (Christopher Plummer, taking over for David Niven), the former Phantom himself. Anyway, this movie shows the progress of the \"Panther\" franchise, when the crazy characters and Clouseau's wacky mannerisms start to really show. Sellers brings slapstick to a fever pitch, making a shambles of everything in his path, not to mention the sanity of his superior, Chief Inspector Dreyfus, played by Herbert Lom. There are lots of funny scenes, including the one in which Clouseau is distracted from a bank robbery by a \"blind\" accordionist and his chimpanzee \"minkey.\" It's definitely one of the better chapters in the \"Pink Panther\" saga.",
         "This is probably the fourth best film in the series, rating only ahead of 'Revenge' in terms of the original Sellers' films. There is some very funny stuff, but not quite up to the standards set in some of the other films. For me, the sequence starting with Clouseau vacuuming Lady Linton's apartment is the best in the movie. Our first meeting with Guy Gadua (sp?) is hysterical as well. Christopher Plummer is good, but Niven would have been better. Too bad he was unavailable.",
         "Although it's already Peter Sellers' third outing in the series, \"The Return of the Pink Panther\" sets the tone for all of the Pink Panther movies still to come. Fast, furious, wacky, and hilarious. In fact, this movie is, in many respects, the movie the first should have been. The plot once again revolves around the Pink Panther diamond. The chief suspect is once again Sir Charles \"The Phantom\" Lytton. And, of course, Peter Sellers is once again on the case as the one-of-a-kind Jacques Clouseau. Class act David Niven has been replaced by the equally classy Christopher Plummer (\"Murder by Decree\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"Dragnet\"). His portrayal of Sir Charles is more dashing and youthful than Niven's. In this film, his character is also more likable, simply because he's working alongside Clouseau rather than against him. And Inspector Clouseau, the underdog, is now, finally, the hero. He's been demoted to bumbling Parisian street cop by his slightly crooked boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (played hilariously for the second time by Herbert Lom.) Then the president of Lugash specifically requests Clouseau be restated in order to find the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from a museum. The return of the Pink Panther diamond is Clouseau's responsibility. The film is divided between Clouseau's quest to find Sir Charles, whom he blames for the Panther's disappearance, and Sir Charles' quest to find the Panther and by doing so clear his name. Clouseau's adventure is filled with more slapstick than in either of the previous two films, and good slapstick, at that. Peter Sellers plays Clouseau in the way that only he could, with results that are guaranteed to make any comedy fan laugh. Meanwhile, Sir Charles' side of the story is filled with action and international intrigue, in a plot that's absurd and confusing, but to be expected from a Pink Panther film. Graham Stark, who played Clouseau's partner in \"A Shot in the Dark\", now appears as Sir Charles' put-upon underworld informant. All is finally right with the Pink Panther universe. Sir Charles is finally likable. It's okay to empathize towards Clouseau. And there's humor in the romantic cat-and-mouse game between Sir Charles' new bride and Clouseau. Lady Lytton is played by Catherine Schell (\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\"), and is, interestingly enough, not the ex-Mrs. Clouseau, one of the earliest cracks in the series' fragile continuity. However, it's amusing to see Lady Lytton take advantage of Clouseau and those around her, whereas in the first movie it just seemed unfair when Clouseau's wife treated him the same way."
