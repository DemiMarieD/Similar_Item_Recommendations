         "I didn't know anything about this movie before I have watched it because it was never released in my own country, as well as book was never published. I am not a big fan of Mel Gibson, I thought that he is just average but too overrated actor. So you can understand why I didn't expect too much from this movie. But now, I want to apologize to Mr. Gibson. In this overlooked masterpiece he proves himself incredibly good both as an actor also as a director. The story was absolutely great, realistic and touching. Relations between two main characters \u0096 former teacher and young student boy (perfectly played by Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl) were shown as great as it possible. It was for sure best Mel Gibson performance ever. Young Nick Stahl acting also looked incredibly good as Chuck Norstadt. All supporting casts also did a very good job in their roles Director and whole cast team brought to us incredibly powerful atmosphere of total misunderstanding in Chuck family and in the whole town. People can't understand and worst of all they don't want to understand other people, who are not like all ordinary people in their small town. If you're not like all \u0096 you're odd and nothing more. This movie teach us never judge people only by appearance and groundless suspicions, teach us always look inside the people. It was very strong, powerful and important messages. All dialogs were very well written and very memorable. In addition to this cinematography and soundtrack were very good. So, I consider The Man Without a Face as a stunning excellent film, best Mel Gibson film, one the best of the year and one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you're a Mel Gibson fan or simply love films with excellent story and perfect acting I highly recommend this film. Thanks a lot Mel and all people involved in this masterpiece. My grade 10 out of 10 or A+++ Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English. Feel free for mailing me about any of my posts and comments here.",
         "A disfigured face as a result of a tragic accident, and unresolved suspicions, result in a life of hermitage for Justin McLeod. His past life as a teacher becomes reawakened by 13 year old Charles, who is on a mission to become educated well enough to pass a military school's entrance exam, and he pleads with McLeod to become his tutor. McLeod's dark past and Charles' unrelenting motivation become unlikely allies as the two of them begin a relationship born of the common thread that each are misunderstood by others. This is an outstanding movie, which is much misunderstood by many viewers and reviewers alike. It's a simple case of an adult taking an interest in and making a difference in a young man's life. The movie is even more poignant because McLeod loses the safety of the anonymity he had worked so hard for, when he opens his mind and heart to young Charles. I have read all of the reviews on this site for this movie and object to those who attempt to review both the movie and the book at the same time. The movie should be reviewed here, and the book at a site for reviewing books. To do both at one time is akin to going to Burger King and ordering a Big Mac. You don't need to be a Mel Gibson fan to love this movie, but you do need to have an open mind and an unfettered agenda. This is a powerful performance by actors Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl, one that will leave your heart happy and your mind engaged. Both thumbs up from me for this movie.",
         "Mel is back and better than ever in \"The Man Without A Face.\" This is Mel's finest film to date as an actor and director. Not only is it touching and heartwarming but it showcases one of the best actor turned directors in Mel Gibson. \"The Man Without A Face\" would be my choice for one of the most touching films I've ever seen. Gibson certainly knew what he was doing as performed along side a newcomer named Nick Stahl. I can't tell people enough positive things about this newcomer who possesses rare natural talent. Gibson played his character Justin McCleod the way actors should portray the characters.......with heart. I can't think of a film that showed the world the reality behind people in Justin's situation. Gibson crafted the story very carefully and it shows. Mel Gibson is an actor with heart and has brought it to big screen as McCleod. I would venture to guess that this role is not that far off than his real-life role as husband and father. When I saw this film, I didn't have to do much but sit back, eat popcorn and drink my soft drink. I knew it was going to be a moving, touching and heartfelt film. However, it turned out to be much more. I was pleasantly surprised how Gibson crafted this film into a work of art by using his knowledge of working in front of the camera. I knew by the end of this film everyone involved with this awesome film from the talented director/actor to the up and coming star along with the viewing audience had fun making and watching \"The Man Without A Face.\" I recommend this film to anyone and everyone young and old who loves movies.",
         "This movie is in my eyes an outstanding example of what films should be like. Nick Stahl and Mel Gibson show their immense ability to act in such a convincing way that this movie can be quoted as the movie with the most impressive story of true, honest and deep friendship. Nowadays, films are often judged concerning the special effects and the action, and classic movies slowly diminish. This film is unique because of the simple fact that the number of movies dealing with a topic like that, a topic that requires the knowledge of classic acting, unfortunately goes down. Nick Stahl, whom I haven't known before, and who is allegedly in the cast of Terminator 3, acts impressive and convincing. It doesn't happen often, but I was moved to tears, for the true friendship between Norstadt and his teacher gives the audience the message that real friendship, the belief in the future and your own self-confidence can help you to solve every problem. Congratulations to Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl, movies like this one, carrying such a pure message of life, preserve the issue of classic films: Move the audience, give them something to think about..... and let them feel the magic of films like this one. Watch this movie, and you'll know how to define friendship. Greetings from Austria to all imdb.com users!!",
         "A beautiful, touching, heartwarming story about a boy living in a dysfunctional family with his mother and two sisters, all of whom posess above average intelligence, and consider him to be the \"retard\" of the family. His only dream is to join the military academy, mostly to get away from his family. He meets a disfigured man (Mel Gibson), the local \"freak\" of the town. After learning that the man used to be a teacher, he asks for tutoring. In time, not only does the man become the boy's tutor, he becomes his best friend. 10/10",
         "Gibson makes a spectacular directorial debut in this story of a relationship between a teacher, a man disfigured from a car accident and a fire and his young and troubled pupil. Both characters learn from each other the values of freedom and true friendship. Impressive performance from Gibson, as the teacher.",
         "A badly disfigured former teacher (Mel Gibson) instructs a youngster (Nick Stahl) who is trying to make the grades to get into boarding school. Gibson's past is mysterious though and Stahl's family history is far from sweet and rosy as well. Difficult drama that has been misunderstood and under-rated ever since its premiere in 1993. Gibson's first directing venture does admittedly have more heart than brains, but he works wonders with what could have been a manipulative and predictable story. Of course this work behind the camera would lead to recent classics \"Braveheart\" and \"The Passion of the Christ\". Heartwrenching and emotionally-charged winner that will pull at you and never completely let go. 4 stars out of 5.",
         "Young Chuck wants more than anything to get into Military School but he will need tutoring to make the grade. His only hope is reclusive Justin McLeod, a former teacher. Justin is a reclusive figure of ridicule in this small town because of his disfigured face and other hushed implications. This mark on his face was from an automobile accident ten years before in which a boy was incinerated and for which he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. When Chuck looks for Justin's help and they become friends, the town's people become suspicious and hostile. I found it to be a good coming-of-age story; however I have to admit I did not get to read the novel - something I prefer to do. So I can not speak to the success of keeping the film in line with the original story. I found it to stand on its own.",
         "This movie was perfect in my eyes. All the actors did a great and perfect job in this movie and i hope whoever else has seen it thinks so too bacause this movie really was great, it had one of those \"feel good\" plots so if you haven't seen it and are feeling a little down, then go rent this one because i guarantee it will make you feel good and happy about life.",
         "Mel Gibson's directorial debut is a fine coming of age film, but it's also much more than that. Nick Stahl, in his debut film, plays a boy named Chuck in a family that is somewhat dysfunctional. Chuck wants to leave to go to military boarding school and follow in his father's footsteps. The problem is he failed in his first attempt to get in, and now he resorts to being tutored by Gibson's disfigured character, who has a questionable past. Along the way, he learns lessons about friendship, knowledge, life, and truth. Newcomer Stahl is fine as the young man, who learns to question the majority and find out things for himself. Gibson is terrifically understated as the renaissance man forced to live in isolation after tragic circumstances. Their scarred backgrounds are what draws them together. The film takes a while to get going, but once it does, we are drawn into a special relationship between Stahl and Gibson. Gibson is a little obvious at times with the Shakespeare references from The Merchant Of Venice, but they do not prevent the film from being ingratiating. Stahl's mother (Margaret Whitton) and sisters (Fay Masterson and Gaby Hoffman), who are all good, have little to do in the film, and the townsfolk are a bit one dimensional. The film is also somewhat predictable as it progresses. Despite these criticisms, the film's message is not lost on us, and it remains a very entertaining coming of age film. This is a very good debut film from Mel Gibson as director. *** of 4 stars."
