He finds out where she lives and goes to her house expecting an apology. Instead, she locks him in her shed and rapes him. It makes him fall for her. But soon her even darker side reveals itself when she believes he is attracted to her more beautiful visiting cousin.",

         "The naysayers on this message board seem to have a very limited appetite for unique cinematic voices. Ms. Hernandez has created a bold movie, both highly personal and passionate. She has told a story about domestic violence without resorting to cliches by cleverly switching the familiar gender roles. The result is a funny and audacious romp through a psychodrama wonderland. Who could not like a film that features Jerri Ryan going berserk, murdering her cousin's beloved pet pig and then serving the ham to her for Sundau dinner. Roger Ebert was right- this is a great film!",
         "This is a great Indie film. Honey Lauren is fantastic. Jeri Ryan gives her best performance of her career. Tamara Hernandez is a director to watch. This is a truly honest film from a director that has a lot to say.",
         "MEN CRY BULLETS is certainly one of the most unique films I've seen. And while the subject of abusive relationships is difficult, writer / director, Tamara Hernandaez brilliantly gender bends the roles, having the female character be the older, abuser of the two. By doing this she lends a unique and interesting view to this very sad and difficult subject matter. I think this is a film that is completely worth seeing and will lend a glimpse into this world in a way that has never been seen before.",
         "A look at disfunctional relationships at it's best. A great study of human behavior dealing with repressed memories, mental illness and sexual desire. Very entertaining with a mesmerizing soundtrack. A very well acted movie with an exciting and up and coming cast.",
         "Billy(Steven Nelson), a young and lonely stage performer, falls in love with a troubled and temperamental older woman, Gloria(Honey Lauren), who has a drinking problem. His obsession with her, and women's in general, gender identification, causes him to put his faith in her alleged \"wisdom,\" and \"experience\" with life. Gloria's cousin Lydia (played by Jeri Ryan) comes to visit, declining to share any ulterior motives until the movie's end. Suspicion and jealousy keep the two cousins distant, until an act of love by Billy for Gloria, meant to cause the death of Lydia, brings them all briefly together in sympathy, if not understanding, of one another's emotional suffering. This does not last long, as an alcoholic's suspicion, a spoiled girl's pride, and a boy's alienation from everyone he's loved restores the walls between them. I loved this film; there are very adult scenes, and very adult subjects introduced during this film, but they are entirely essential. the film also addresses topics such as emotional boundaries, self-respect, pride and desire, and ambition.",
         "This movie is certainly not for everybody. It may be too deep, too shocking, too uncomfortable or maybe too campy for some. Within the dark humor it offers a very modern, original take on sex and violence and gender roles. For those who are willing, this movie has a lot to say with a wicked sense of humor and original, funny dialogue.",
         "The nicest thing I can say about this movie is that Jeri Ryan was terrific as the sanest character in it. She says things like, \"My toes make people happy,\" and, \"I think I have a real shot at Miss America,\" and she comes off as funny for her shallowness. The second nicest thing I can say is that the film is a caricature of how people with serious, unhealthy relationship issues think. The film is intense from beginning to end -- but not in a good way. You can't look away. It's like a train wreck...two trains...full of demented circus clowns. I just can't overstate how bad this movie is. To call this film a freak show would probably not insult the director, but it's not as interesting as it is repulsive. Run, don't walk, as fast as you can."
