         "I was a \"Seabee\" w/ MCB 4, from 1964-1970!! In basic training in Port Hueneme California, during our first week of training we were marched to the post theater, and were shown this movie. We for the most part thought it was a good movie, but thought it might have been a little overplayed as a promotional thing to peak our interests in becoming a \"SeaBee!? ..Well after two full tours in Viet Nam, with my battalion! I have come to the realization. That this is one of the few Wayne war movies of the WW2 time frame that is as close to accurate as they could portray a unit of the Armed Forces! A bunch of Construction workers doing their damndest to get a job done no matter the adversity or dangers ! the only real link they had to being in the military was the fact they were wearing uniforms! they Build and Fight! and Party hard !! just as we did and as the Bees still do !!",
         "John Wayne is the boss of a civilian construction company building for the Navy in WW2. While working on a remote Pacific island the attacking Japanese forces interrupt construction and Wayne must convince the Government to let his men help the Navy fight back; thus the world renowned 'fighting Seabees'. This is a very good war drama and a fine cast that also features Susan Hayward, Dennis O'Keefe and William Frawley.",
         "Before writing this review I took a quick look at Wikipedia and the article they have on the Seabees. Despite the fanciful story that Borden Chase wrote here about how the service was founded, the Seabees were actually an idea already thought of by Admiral Ben Morreell the Chief of Navy Supply even before Pearl Harbor. Unlike the war in Europe where the Allies would be looking to take an hold cities with facilities already there, like air fields for example, those planning the war in the Pacific knew that they would be starting from scratch. Airfields, fuel depots, etc. would have to be constructed on jungle islands in the Pacific. So the idea of a separate service for the construction trade was born. Now that we know that the plot of The Fighting Seabees is so much hogwash, let me say that what the film does do very well is show the hazards of what the men in that service faced. Trying to build facilities at the same time as the enemy is firing on them. The scenario in this film is repeated many times over on the islands of the Pacific. As to the story of this film, John Wayne reverses roles here. In most of his war films he's usually the professional military man, here he's the tough, but inpatient civilian who never seems to learn the value of military discipline. Of course being this is the Duke, he does redeem himself in the end in a spectacular manner. A love triangle is tossed in here, rather unnecessarily in my opinion, a straightforward account of Seabee heroism would have been sufficient. Wayne and Navy Commander Dennis O'Keefe are both interested in war correspondent Susan Hayward. This was Hayward's second film with John Wayne, who along with Clark Gable, and Dean Martin, she once described as her three favorite leading men. Her big scene is when she's wounded and thinks she's cashing in, she declares her love for the Duke. Susan Hayward has always been a favorite of mine, but it's on the strength of her performances in her starring roles in the Fifties, not as the sex object in The Fighting Seabees. The Fighting Seabees isn't one of the Duke's top 10 or even top 20, but it's a decent enough film to sit through even with the World War II heroic bravado that was obligatory at the time this was made. You even get to see John Wayne attempt the jitterbug. During that scene, the Duke looks mighty uncomfortable. He was never going to compete with Fred Astaire for roles.",
         "Having watched this in the wee hours of Veterans' Day, I just wanted to point out that rating it and other WWII propaganda films on the basis of artistic merit is beside the point entirely. The people that made these didn't have the luxury of crafting meticulous stories and memorable characters; most of the movies had been contracted by the government and had to be turned out QUICKLY. Movies like \"The Fighting Seabees\" were made for one reason alone: as propaganda pieces designed to bolster public support for our fighting men overseas. As such, they were an important part of the war effort, and helped ensure that fifty years later, we'd have the luxury of sitting at our computers and hashing about their qualities as movies. With all that in mind, \"The Flying Seabees\" is really pretty good.",
         "A fine John Wayne movie and no WWII movie collector should be without it. This movie's great patriotic musical score is also a fine example of strong & very well-written harmonies for male chorus; the score sounds like the U.S. Navy Band's men's chorus (an astounding group of music professionals by the way) and is a dramatic performance that supports this very positive story of the Seabees. With some added drama along the way, this movie demonstrates some of the work done by the SeaBees - building facilities & runways on remote islands during WWII; massive runway construction with PSP grid materials, bulldozing, & hut construction, which were all representative of the basics that needed accomplishing during this campaign. This was a refreshing viewing experience in that the then media was supportive of the American fighting man, and while this may make some in today's culture wince, that's their problem. Today's warriors and sailors are just as honorable & deserving of the kind of support that surrounds this kind of movie, and watching this production reminds you of that fact. Very dramatic, perhaps over-acted at times, but a great story about our fine Seabees! If you are a patriot, I believe you'll enjoy this movie.",
         "Picked this up as a cheap DVD as I am a sucker for 40's/50's WW2 films. Taken as a bit of propaganda and entertainment, and not reflecting in any way historical fact, it achieves it's aim. IMO, it is not up to the standard of some of Wayne's other WW2 films of this period such as Sands of Iwo Jima and They Were Expendable. It is somewhat disjointed, but I can imagine it having a positive effect on recruitment for the US Forces. Some earlier threads have commented on the reasons why Wayne did not have active war service. Whatever the reason, I would think he had a more positive effect on by being on film rather than seeing active service.",
         "CONTINUING in the Hollywood tradition and fine custom of rendering a fine line of films which were used as a means of communications and edification to the American People; we find the folks over on \"Poverty Row\" chipping in and pulling more than their weight. With the release of THE FIGHTING SEABEES (Republic Pictures, 1945) not only filled the bill, but also turned out to be one of the finest movies to come out of that studio. BEING the Studio which had the (deserved) reputation of producing mostly attractions for the Saturday Matinée crowd; these of course being mainly the \"B\" Western Series and the Serials;Republic did such titles as THE RED PONY, SANDS OF IWO JIMA and THE QUIET MAN;all \"A\" Films. IN addition to those listed above, we must add what is today's analyzed specimen, the screen story of the Naval Construction Battalion, much better known as THE FIGHTING SEABEES. Although it was produced in time for a 1945 release, it still packed a punch with the morale of the Armed Forces; as well as that of those at home. SENSING that they had a very important story to tell, the Production Team set out to \"Bulk up\" the headliners of the cast. First of all they needed a male lead. They wanted someone who would have had experience in both the dramatic vein and in the action genre. He would have to be a 100% red blooded American Male. Well, the Republic Brain trust didn't have to look very far at all; for among their Contract Players one True Movie \"Star\" who would fit the bill to an absolute degree. Gee, I wonder just who that would be? ONE would certainly not have to be a film buff to come up with the answer in John Wayne. DUKE had put in a lot of time and paid his dues with a long stint as the featured player in that series of Lone Star Western Productions, which of course was a subsidiary of Monogram Pictures. Mr. Wayne later signed on with Republic, where he was cast as the lead in their THREE MESKITEERS Western Series. More importantly, it was during this period that he was lent out to just about every studio for some movie or other. In one of his loan-outs, Director John Ford borrowed his services from Republic for the male lead in STAGECOACH (Walter Wanger Productions/United Artists, 1939) It gave a big boost to Duke's value and her saw his stock go sky high. WORKING for about all of the other Studios in various types of roles (mostly those of a Man of Action of some sort or another), Wayne's name and reputation grew considerably. So for this time at least, there would be no going to 20th Century-Fox, Universal, Paramount or MGM for a starring role in a major motion picture. Duke would have only to stay on the Republic lot. COSTARS for the production were a pair of most capable and popular Actors. Second lead went to Dennis O'Keefe, who while never ascending to the heights of Star, nonetheless had been most successful in many a lesser movie and as a capable, likable of a Second Lead. His casting proved to be well done as he and Wayne performed very well together, having several great scenes together. ADDITION of Miss Susan Hayward, on loan from 20th Century-Fox (?) to the cast gave the film a great balance on the top of the bill. The insertion of her character (or any lovely lady) into the story would almost always be cause for an example of \"the Eternal Triangle.\" And so it was; but this was Wartime and it would be handled in such a way as to remind all that this was a time of sorrow and self-sacrifice. REPIUBLIC spared no expense in adding to the cast in a great number of tried and true character actors in supporting roles. The task was accomplished with the employ of such names as: William Frawley (Fred Mertz and 'Bub', later on TV), Grant Withers, Chief Thundercloud, J.M. Kerrigan, Leonid Kinskey, Paul Fix (Mica), Ben Welden and many others. WHILE Republic gave THE FIGHTING SEABEES a much larger budget than most, they still got their money's worth in every respect; for while the movie called for a great deal more outdoor shooting on location than most any other of what they usually made in their Westerns and Serials. Their remedy was to stick to what they always did the best; that being to put their 'Thrill Factory Assembly Line\" into working on the production. THIS meant that they merely went to doing what they did best. They could use some of their own stock scenes of explosions, floods, fires and volcanic eruptions in movie after movie, without any adverse effect. These were always convincing and had served them well for years in lesser films. THE reason because of their great Special Effects department, the scenes of train & airplane crashes or what have you, were done by the best guys in the business; being the Brothers Lydecker, Howard and Theodore. Their work was as fine as any in Hollywood and much better than in most cases. Even the 'Big 5' Studios of MGM, Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, RKO Radio and Warner Brothers all looked covetously at Republic's Special Effects team. OUR STORY\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085Following the events of December 7, 1941 the need to have an all military construction unit; as the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces had no respect for unarmed civilian workers who were employed in building air strips, military compounds, etc., all throughout the Philippines and other locales in the South Pacific, They waste not a frame of film in giving background, the problems and the solution. POUND for pound or rather frame for frame, we can't think of a better example of a great World War II Movie, BAR NONE! POODLE SCHNITZ!!",
         "Saying this film is \"propaganda\" is not an insult. No, it was deliberately crafted to encourage Americans that we can and will win the war if we stand firm. And what better image of this than the ever-vigilant John Wayne--the embodiment of the Hollywood image of heroism. This film reminds me a lot of The Flying Tigers, though the plot isn't so melodramatic. It's about a crew of civilian engineers sent overseas to do construction for our troops (such as building runways and other projects). BUT, the evil Japanese in the movie take advantage of the fact that these are unarmed civilians and butcher them at every opportunity. So, what is The Duke and his trusted pals to do? Take up arms and use their own equipment when necessary to beat the stuffing out of the Japs! Yes, guys with bulldozers and clubs NEVER could have inflicted the casualties you witness in the movie, but man if it isn't entertaining to watch--particularly the explosive ending.",
         "The fighting seabees is an excellent little war movie and John Wayne is terrific in the lead role. The film has a good storyline and there is a lot of action and battles. The action is extremely loud and heavy use is made of rifles,machine guns, gattling guns, grenades and cannons. The final battle is the best part of the movie, in which the duke heroically risks his life to blow up a fuel tank. I liked the fighting seabees because of the action and the storyline. Its just as good as the dukes other war movies like back to bataan and flying tigers. Highly recommended",
         "There should be no doubt that this film is a highly over simplified account of how the U.S. Navy Seabees came into existence. John Wayne portrays the hot headed owner of Donovan Construction Company, who offers his services to the government in building airfields and related support fortifications for the war effort. The story centers on Wedge Donovan's single mindedness in getting his men armed so they can defend themselves under attack; as civilians they have no such authority. Boiled down, Wayne's role was to make a lot of foolish mistakes that got many of his men killed, both out of uniform and as soldiers. Complicating matters for Donovan is a three way love triangle supplied by reporter Connie Chesley (Susan Hayward) and her fiancé Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow (Dennis O'Keefe). When Connie suffers a near fatal wound following a Japanese invasion of Island X-371, Yarrow overhears Donovan and Chesley exchanging \"I Love You's\" together. Ever the stalwart military man, Yarrow doesn't seem to take it personally, even as he continues to pine for his woman. The fight scenes offer some unique twists that one would not expect. As Japanese tanks advance on the island, the Seabees combine ingenuity with resolve by battling the enemy with bulldozers and cranes. The surreal nature of the exchange makes one wonder if such fighting actually could have taken place, though I imagine it would have been possible. Only John Wayne could go into battle without a weapon, and in seconds take out three attacking Japanese while securing a rifle in the process. It comes as a surprise then when his character dies on the battlefield, first shot and then blown up by enemy fire. Most of his men suffer the same fate, a colorful supporting cast that includes William Frawley, Leonid Kinskey, Grant Withers, Paul Fix and Ben Welden. With no sense of a time dimension for the history of the Seabees, and a hit and run approach to the Wayne/Hayward/O'Keefe romance, the movie has a disjointed feel and is best approached as an entertainment piece and not a serious exploration of it's subject matter. The film closes on an appropriately patriotic note, with Commander Yarrow reading a presidential citation for the heroes of X-371. The movie's theme is formalized with the line - \"We build for the fighters, we fight for what we build\"."
