Once you see Chucky go full force for the first time, it's pretty hard to try and reel him back in to a \"Is he or isn't he\" mystery for the sequels. And even if it is a step down from the first _Child's Play_, getting to watch new characters experience their \"I was so wrong I died\" moments is always a cause for glee.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★ - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go._",

      "synopsis": "Two years later, Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) and her eight-year-old son Andy (Alex Vincent) have filed a lawsuit against the Play Pals Toy Company, manufacturer and distributor of the Good Guy Doll franchise. Due to lack of testimony from the Chicago Police Department, the case is dismissed. Karen is remanded to a psychiatric institution for observation, and Andy is sent to the Midtown Children's Crisis Center in Chicago to await temporary foster custody. The executives of Play Pals decide to have the original Chucky (Brad Dourif) doll reconstructed in order to dispel the negative publicity stirred up by the nationwide trial. During reconstruction, a technician (Ed Krieger) is killed in presumably a freak accident which reinvokes serial killer Charles Lee Ray's dormant spirit within the doll. Meanwhile, experienced foster couple Phil and Joanne Simpson (Gerrit Graham & Jenny Agutter) who are already fostering a seventeen-year-old named Kyle (Christine Elise) decide to take Andy into their care as well. Chucky obtains information on Andy's new living arrangements, and holds an executive named Mattson (Geg Germann) hostage, forcing Mattson to transport him to the Simpson's address. When they arrive, Chucky kills Mattson before gaining entry into the home undetected. Chucky proceeds to dispose and take the place of Tommy (Edan Gross), a Good Guy Doll that is identical in appearance to him. The following night, Chucky ties and gags Andy to his bed, attempting to possess him. The ritual is immediately interrupted by Kyle who is seen sneaking into Andy's bedroom window. Chucky hastily promises Andy he will make another posession attempt on him the next time he is found alone, before he returns inanimate. Andy tries to warn Phil, Joanne, and Kyle though no one believes him. Phil humors Andy's problem by throwing Chucky in the basement. The next morning, Chucky follows Andy to school and kills his teacher Miss Kettlewell (Beth Grant). Andy escapes and returns back to the Simpson's home where he continues to warn Phil and Joanne, but they still do not believe him. Later that night, Andy descends into the basement with an electric knife after discovering Chucky has returned to the basement. Chucky who had been anticipating Andy's arrival, pounces on him and a struggle ensues. Phil ventures downstairs to investigate the noise and ends up getting killed by Chucky. Kyle runs to call an ambulance, while Joanne blames Andy for the death and has him sent back to the Center. Kyle disposes of Chucky in a trash can before uncovering the remains of Tommy in the backyard. When Kyle finds out that Chucky is missing, she goes back inside the house and finds Joanne's corpse. Chucky attacks Kyle and forces her to drive him to the Center. When they arrive, Chucky kills Andy's social worker Grace Poole (Grace Zabriskie) before kidnapping Andy and forcing him into the back of a Chicago Sun-Times van. Kyle tailgates the van before cutting it off at an intersection and chasing Chucky and Andy into a truck garage at the Play Pals factory. Chucky knocks Andy unconscious before beginning the ritual. Though it would appear that Chucky has suceeded his nose instantaneously begins to bleed, thus signifying his soul's permanence within the walls of the doll. An irate Chucky threatens to kill Andy as a means of revenge for stalling. Luckily, Kyle and Andy reunite and guide themselves through the manufacturing floor with Chucky relentlessly pursuing them. Chucky ends up killing a technician (Don Pugsley) before the duo manage to trap him in one of the machines, severing his legs. Andy sprays a vat of molten plastic onto Chucky melting him, while Kyle shoves an air hose into Chucky's mouth causing his head to inflate to the point of explosion.",

         "I think I liked Child's Play 2 more than most people, given the reviews that I've read and the movie's low voter rating on the IMDb. A cute kid's doll is once again the unlikely home of Charles Lee Ray, notorious serial killer, again feeding off of the surrealism created by seeing a kid's doll screw it's face into expressions of the purest rage and spouting all manner of profanities. By now, Ray is becoming more and more desperate to get out of the body of the doll, because as we were informed in the first film, if he spends too much time in that body he'll gradually become more and more human until one day he'll be stuck in it forever. Needless to say, Ray's a lot more interested in starting life over as a 6-year-old (and who wouldn't?) rather than spending the rest of his life as a plastic doll. Although, given that he becomes more human the longer he is in that body, how human will he eventually become? Will he ever reach full human-hood? My guess is that he'll gradually approach being a real human being in a sort of half life, where he gets closer and closer and closer but never actually gets there, kind of like computer generated actors. There is currently much talk about how close computers can ever get to animating convincingly real people into the movies, and the leading theory seems to be something akin to my theory of Chucky turning human. He'll always get closer but he'll never get all the way there. At any rate, Andy's mother has landed in a mental institution and Andy has been taken in by a foster family with appropriate mental vacuity to be a horror movie surrogate family. When Andy becomes frightened and runs through the house, his foster father grabs him and says, 'Rule #1, no running in the house!' OK, 'dad,' but not even when I open a closet and find myself confronted by the doll that landed my mom in the nuthouse and almost cost me my life and my very soul? My God, man, what the hell is this guy doing with a Good Guys doll in the house in the first place? It's difficult enough trying to figure out why it's even there WITHOUT having to watch this mental giant grab Andy by the arm and ask him what on earth is the matter. There are some funny moments in the film, such as when Chucky smashes the head of the innocent Good Guys doll, buries it, and takes its place in the house, and my favorite, when Chucky is later addressed by a doting adult, Chucky responds by saying in his cute doll voice, 'Hi! I'm\u0085.Tommy!' The stockholders in the Play Pal corporation are distressed over the suffering that the company has endured due to the negative publicity of the events of the first movie provide the premise for the movie's rather impressive finale. In order to generate a more positive image for the company and the doll, they have decided to reintroduce it into the market. The original Chucky doll was collected by the company and examined by toy-makers, who decided that there really was nothing truly wrong with it, it was not really a demon-possessed toy, so they decided to melt it down and remake it. Why they didn't just throw it away I'm not really sure, but who cares. Waste not, want not, I guess. At any rate, Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body (too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another), and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul. I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something, but you'll remember in the first movie, the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll. Jarrett Friend, writing for HorrorWatch, made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation, but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls, since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie. This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality; my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big. Nevertheless, even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story, Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels, kind of like Psycho II, which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence. I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2, but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting, if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape. There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film, not including, however, the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost, making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so. A bit trite, but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film, which is the final scene, one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie. Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene. I do, however, think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got. I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits. What do you think the IMDb is for?",
         "Universal must have realized the potential this franchise had and quickly snapped up the rights from MGM after the first movie came out. Writer Don Mancini also must have figured out that his creation of a foul-mouthed killer doll was too good for just one film. The Chucky series would seriously evolve and change over the years but even in this first sequel things are already looking quite different, even if it suffers from Deja Vu a little bit. Now that the cat is out of the bag and we know that Chucky really is alive and it isn't just Andy's imagination, our killer doll gets much more screen time and his wicked personality has more time to develop. The animatronics have improved and a lot of Chucky's character comes through in his wild facial expressions. Director John Lafia shoots the film with a bright, playroom color pallet with most of the location footage done in Los Angeles with only a few key shots done in Chicago (as if the Windy City was ever this sunny). Despite the autumn setting it does feel like a rather Xmas-y film. He's also fully aware of how silly the killer doll concept is and seizes the opportunity for some of the self-aware sarcastic humor seen in the later films. Graeme Revell usually does the most generic horror scores, especially in recent years, but surprisingly he gives Child's Play 2 the best score of the series with a full orchestra at his disposal, he doesn't hold back on the action cues and even delivers a couple of pretty good themes. So much better than the rotten score to the first film and probably one of the best horror scores of the 90s, or even of all time. It really is that good, and elevates this sequel to a higher level than most snobby critics would consider it deserves. There isn't much of a story to Child's Play 2 however. It's just the same as the first, with Chucky going after Andy, who is now staying with a foster family, once more. The body count is higher and there are some good kills, but I wish that the running time wasn't so anorexic and that it held back on the \"lurking in the dark\" scenes. The slick quality and silly nature of Child's Play 2 is probably what prompted Universal to stick with the franchise for good and 23 years later the Chucky films are still coming out. To think that if MGM held on to the rights, we may never have had them.",
         "\"Child's Play 2\" is the first sequel to the popular 1988 original. The first film was a very entertaining horror film. The second movie in the series isn't as good, but it's not real bad either. However, the filmmakers took the gory route for this one. All the graphic violence makes it less effective. The first movie worked so well because it kept the violence down to a minimal. Oh the first film was violent, but not as violent as this one. But it's stylish look somehow makes it watchable. And, like the original, it's entertaining to watch. Young Alex Vincent reprises his role from the original as Andy Barclay, the boy who in this movie goes to live with foster parents while his mother seeks psychiatric help (from the events in \"Child's Play\"). Andy himself still isn't all together, and when Chucky the killer doll re-enters his life again, watch out! \"Child's Play 2\" may not be as good as \"Child's Play\", but it sure is better than the next movie in the series, \"Child's Play 3\" (which I thought was awful). I haven't seen the fourth movie yet (\"Bride of Chucky\"), so I can't voice my opinion on that one at the moment. **1/2 (out of four)",
         "It's difficult to accept the numerous poor reviews this movie garnered, particularly those from bona fide horror buffs. Of all the films within major horror series stretching from the late '70s to the '90s -- Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween among them -- \"Child's Play 2\" deserves a place very close to the top. This sequel picks up two years after the original in which young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) was tormented by Chucky, the killer-possessed doll trying to transfer his soul into the child's body. With his mother traumatized, Andy is sent to live with a foster family. Trouble is, there's a certain rebuilt Good Guy brand doll all too eager to get reacquainted. \"Child's Play 2\" is solid horror fare. It has legitimate thrills as the seemingly innocent doll plunges to murderous life in the blink of an eye. It has a smart, unpredictable storyline. Its strongest asset, however, is an exciting finale at the Good Guy doll factory in which Chucky, piece by piece, meets his maker. First he's forced to amputate his own hand (he replaces it with a knife blade). Then his legs are torn off in an unsuccessful maiming. Next he's showered in gallons of steaming hot doll plastic before finally having an electrical cord stuffed in his mouth, exploding his head into a thousand gooey pieces. Where do they come up with this stuff? There are plenty of other things to like about this picture. Its budget is much higher than that of the original, a fact that shows up in leaps and bounds on the screen. With the origin storyline out of the way, the sequel is able to focus solely on the excitement without getting bogged down in too many details. And Brad Dourif outdoes himself as the creepily frightening voice of the homicidal doll. \"Child's Play 2\" established Chucky as a legitimate horror icon. Simply put, the series never again reached this high a caliber and probably never will.",
         "Child's Play 2 picks up not long after where its infamous predecessor left off, and straight into the film, the original Good Guy doll housing the spirit of the Lakeshore Strangler is being fixed up and Good Guys are back in action. While unfortunately, Chris Sarandon and Catherine Hicks do not return, they are at least mentioned, and given plausible reasons as to why they could not be in the movie. Innocent Andt Barclay (Alex Vincent) however returns, and is once again at the mercy of Chucky (voiced by the classic Brad Douriff) when Chucky traces Andy down to where he is living in foster care. From there, the typical mayhem follows, with plenty of doll-style murders, witty lines from Chucky and a great finale at the Good Guy doll factory. While the original Child's Play is a terrifying classic, part 2 is somewhat of a step down, only because one knows what to expect, for the most part. However, the cast are a great asset to the film. Alex Vincent is right on the mark in his role as Andy, Christine Elise is terrific as his foster sister Kyle, and Jenny Agutter adds a touch of class as their foster mother Joanne Simpson. Gerrit Graham plays her strict husband, and Grace Zabriskie is good in her role as the career at the orphanage. Beth Grant steals the moment in her small role as Mrs Kettlewell however. Overall, a fun sequel to the original, with a well rounded cast and plenty of thrills to keep one entertained.",
         "Chucky is one of those dolls that can't stay dead, still inhabited by an evil spirit. The little boy he turned into an orphan is leaving the clinic now that he's over the traumatic situation (or so the head of the clinic tells his adoptive parents). His adoptive parents take him home and you know things aren't going to settle down when a Chucky doll drops from the top shelf of a closet he's exploring. The evil Chucky doll finds his way to the household, switches places with the toy doll and buries it, setting the stage for things to come. Credibility really is strained by the time we get to the schoolroom scene where Chucky has followed the boy to school, lands magically in his classroom and manages to start trouble between the boy and the teacher, who subsequently gets killed by Chucky after the boy has climbed out a window. Takes quite an imagination to think of these plot lines, but when the imagination runs wild plausibility begins to suffer. Following the schoolhouse segment, the bizarre incidents keep piling up as Chucky gets away with more and more havoc and no one believes the boy is telling the truth--just as in the original. None of the incidents are as startling or as well staged as in CHILD'S PLAY, but it still manages to hold the interest with some original touches tinged with fright and a weird sense of humor. Especially good are the effects toward the end when Chucky holds the spunky adopted girl and boy captive as the story speeds toward an ending in the toy factory. The factory sequence has some grotesque chills as one of the workers gets caught up in the doll machinery and Chucky himself suffers quite a few \"happenings\" at the toy factory before he's liquidated by the boy. Entertaining nonsense despite the strain on credibility.",
         "After the success of the Child's Play (1988), writer and creator Don Mancini knew that a sequel would be on its way. And of course, the smart thing to do would be to continue the story from the first movie. And for the most part, the sequel stays faithful to the story line. It does have a few areas that need to be addressed but all around it pretty much matches its parent. After the torturous event of Charles Lee Ray (The Lakeshore Strangler) attacking the Barclay home, it was time to move on. Sadly things didn't get better for Andy Barclay. Andy's mother is sent to a psych ward for help and Andy is put into a foster home. Making matters worse, is the Good Guy Doll company somehow acquired the burnt dismembered parts of Chucky and decided to clean him off and put him back together. Unbeknownst to them, once re-assembled, Chucky comes back to life and begins his rampage of violence to find Andy again. And that's all there is to this. It is just another set up to have Chucky (voice by Brad Dourif) killing people to get to the boy that he told his secret to. Is it bad? No, it actually can hold its own as a good sequel. The weakest area is Mr. Mancini's writing. For example, very few audiences are familiar with voodoo and it's never explained to why Chucky came back to life after being re-assembled. Was that apart of the voodoo spell? Besides, in the first movie, wasn't it shooting Chucky in the heart the only way to kill him? That's a big loophole. However, it's also forgivable because a lot of people like Chucky, so it's obvious a lot of people will not care too much. It's crazy though how similar this sequel is like Hellraiser II: Hellbound (1988). The director of Hellbound was a crewmember for Hellraiser (1987) and then directed the sequel. Same goes for John Lafia, the director of this film. He too was apart of Child's Play (1988) and then went on to direct the sequel to this franchise. And both sequels are decent and have good continuity but suffer from weak reasoning for the logic behind the continuity. A very similar parallel that is interesting to think about. As for actors, it's obvious that Brad Dourif is needed to play Chucky and his performance is always the best. Next is Alex Vincent whom fans should be happy to see because he's a key part of why Chucky exists and his performance is just as likable as he was from the first movie. Lastly is Christine Elise who plays another foster child named Kyle who befriends Andy. At a point she develops a strong will to fight and it's good that she wasn't written in as a scream and do nothing girl. But as for the rest of the cast, they aren't much to talk about. The foster parents and every other individual are the same. They don't believe a killer doll exists (and right fully so, IF this were a reality). Oh well, their loss. The last couple of elements that viewers should enjoy is the cinematography by Stefan Czapsky and music. Unlike the first movie, which contained grittier and darker colors, this movie has brighter more elementary colors, which give something new for fans to look at. Plus, the music produced by upcoming composer at the time, Graeme Revell, did a much better job than the score from the first movie by Joe Renzetti. Here Revell actually uses an orchestra and not just synths. And, Revell even gives the Child's Play franchise a motif theme and some creepy tunes. A well developed horror score. Does it top its predecessor - no. Is it a good sequel - yes. Like other horror sequels, it lacks clarification on logic but it still amounts to a decent sequel. The score has improved as well allowing to sound more like a horror film.",
         "Incredible 1990's Sequel Into The Child's Play Series. Chucky returns as a doll again possessed by the soul of a serial killer. He goes after Andy to take over his soul. Chucky destroys everyone who stands in his way of his plan. Another amazing performance by Alex Vincent who starred as Andy. He did great in this sequel and it was great seeing him on screen again. He brought on a incredible performance going against Chucky once again. Also Brad Dourif did great playing the Voice of Chucky. Chucky was funny and dangerous this time around again. Also great acting by Christine Elise and the entire cast. I recommend Child's Play 2 and The Child's Play Series To Everyone. Looking forward In Seeing More Created. PHENOMENAL HORROR CLASSIC!",
         "Play Pal Toys has received the badly charred remains of Chucky from the first film, with an attempt to rebuild the doll, in order to try & figure out what caused it to malfunction. A freak accident in the lab however, results in the death of an employee & the revival of the twisted psycho. Out & about, Chucky tracks down ANDY BARCLAY (The returning ALEX VINCENT) now living with a foster family. Chucky attempts to accomplish a mission he failed to do the last time: Trade souls with the first person he revealed his secret to - young Andy, since the voodoo spell he uses to switch bodies will not work on other humans. Like the last time, Chucky only has so long to accomplish his mission, because he is slowly turning human & if he becomes fully human within the frame of the doll, he'll be trapped as a doll forever. Along the way, he picks up where he last left off, cutting a swath of blood through a series of victims. CHILD'S PLAY 2 is a really fun sequel, to a really fun, scary horror film! It has many moments to rival the original films many suspenseful sequences, such as Andy looking for Chucky, while roaming about the basement in the middle of the night, where he knows Chucky is hiding out. Teen bad girl Kyle, discovering the corpse of her foster mother & being attacked by Chucky in the bedroom only for him to disappear & her looking around wondering where he will strike. A huge stalk & chase in a doll factory etc. KEVIN YAGHER'S new Chucky puppet is much better looking than his old one. It's clear the film-makers had more money to play with, since they are able to do more things with the puppet than what they were last time. The co-screenwriter of the first, JOHN LAFIA (DON MANCINI also returns to pen the script) slips into the directors chair for this one, taking the reigns from original director Tom Holland & does a fabulous job, milking many scenes in the film, for more maximum tension suspense & impact. BRAD DOURIF reprises his role as Chucky (He provides the voice) & further goes to show that in another actors hands, Chucky just wouldn't be anywhere near as fun. The acting works for the most part, Christina Elise is really good as the teenage heroine of the show, while An American Werewolf In London's own JENNY AUGUTTER & C.H.U.D. II's GERRIT GRAHAM, both put in good performances as the foster family. Alex Vincent continues to be a real find in his role as the sympathetic Andy. What should be noted about CHILD'S PLAY 2 is despite it's serious storyline, the film-makers have turned him into an almost Freddy Kruger like character, since he spews a series of bad puns before, during & after he dismantles his victims, something he didn't do in the first. Weather taking the franchise into the realm that the later A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET entries went with Freddy, was a choice on the film-makers part, or a result of the studio heads is not known. The film has a light sprinkling of comedy, as one can't help but chuckle at Chucky's bad puns. What also should be noted is how several concepts in the film are taken from the original film's psychological horror driven script (Then titled BLOOD BUDDY) a bully who troubles Andy (Though this adds nothing to the film & could so easily have been written around) & a teacher who keeps Andy after school winds up being killed by Chucky, when he batters her repeatedly with a ruler (Ironically enough the original CHILD'S PLAY script was later adopted & re-written in areas & filmed as Pinocchio's Revenge/Pinocchio Syndrome, a direct to video horror film released in 1996) That said I did have a problem with the films concept early on. We are informed from the outset, that Andy's mother has been put in a psychiatric hospital over her claims that Chucky was alive & was doing all the murders, yet whatever became of Mike Norris & his partner? surely they could have backed her story, since they both seen Chucky alive themselves? Since Chucky was becoming human at the end, wouldn't the police & Play Pal Toy executives find it a little odd that Chucky had a human tongue, blood in him, & human teeth? what about his body? would it not contain some human organs including remnants of his shot to pieces heart? wouldn't this give them cause to pause & wonder why a plastic doll, had these odd features? speaking of the body, why is it that his head is used by the executives to see what malfunctioned & not the rest of the body? what made them think that the head had something to do with a malfunction & not some other part of the doll? None of this is really answered. GRAEME REVELL does the score here & it's terrific throughout. Look for MATT ROE as a cop, he played a psychic in PUPPET MASTER, another killer doll movie to emerge on video shelves after the original CHILD'S PLAY. All in all, while is is nowhere near as scary as the first, CHILD'S PLAY 2 has it's own wicked sense of style & fun. It's not very gory, but it's death scenes are pretty neat & the whole plot is pretty fun. Highly entertaining & fun & definitely recommended to fans of the first. Followed by CHILD'S PLAY 3 ***1/2 stars",
         "It's been a few days since the last romp with Chucky, the killer doll. Chucky's been completely burnt up, but the company that made the Good Guy dolls, Play Pals, found the doll and are rebuilding it! The production is headed by a little weasel and an adulterer, Matson. The president of the company, Mr. Sullivan, stops by and witnesses a technician being electrocuted when inserting Chucky's eyes. Matson reported that Andy is at a children's crisis center and Karen is under psychiatric observation. He said they're the only two who claim the doll was alive. Aren't we forgetting Detective Mike Norris from the first Child's Play? He also believed the story about Chucky. What happened to him? Was he committed or did he deny the story? What a creep! Andy is going to be adopted by the Simpsons. Not the Homer Simpsons! The Phil and Joanne Simpsons! Phil is a jerk. He thinks Andy is nuts, but not Joanne. At the house, Andy adapts nicely. He even meets a teenage refugee named Kyle. She's been in foster homes for a long time. Andy likes his new toy filled bedroom, but it contains a Good Guy doll! Tommy. Meanwhile, Chucky tracks down his prey and breaks one of Joanne's glass statues. The family blames Andy and/or Kyle. I can tell right off they were blaming Andy. The next day, Andy goes to school. Chucky follows him! While Andy is at recess, Chucky writes a terrible, and hilarious message on Andy's paper. The first word begins with F and rhymes with Luck. Second word is You and third word is Bitch. The teacher, Miss Kettlewell (Beth Grant, who's simply in everything and is annoying in everything!) She blames Andy for the message and locks him in the classroom while telephoning the Simpsons. I see, so teachers are allowed to lock students in their classrooms now? I never heard of that. That night, Andy goes searching for Chucky with a turkey carving electric knife. He meets up with Chucky. Phil goes to investigate. Chucky kills him and Andy is blamed. Andy goes back to the Center and Chucky takes Kyle hostage and they go to retrieve Andy. Chucky has to transfer Andy's soul into him or be doomed to be a plastic (or is it rubber?) doll forever. They end up going to the Play Pals factory! Kyle and Andy run all over the machines which demonstrates how the dolls are made. There's a hilarious as well as gruesome moment when a technician has a run-in with the plastic eye inserting machine. Let's just say he now has two plastic eyes shoved where his old ones used to be. Chucky get's quit a few scars and a few appendages removed, and soon is blown to pieces. Kyle and Andy walk home. Wherever that is. This film is the best in the series. Second best is Bride of Chucky. 3rd was terrible. 1st had a good beginning but the rest just blew like the wind. So I recommend you see this film! Brad Dourif has a great evil voice! -"
