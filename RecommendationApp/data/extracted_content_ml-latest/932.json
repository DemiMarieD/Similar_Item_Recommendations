      "reviews": [
         "This is an absolutely beautiful flim, with two beautiful, shining stars. Deborah Kerr, always the epitome of British lady-like reserve... that dainty face and that curled red hair... always bringing a grace to the roles she plays (except for Karen Holmes in \"From Here To Eternity\"... but that's another story). She's breathtakingly grand as Terry McKay, the class-act who falls in love with a playboy (Grant), though she is engaged to another. And Cary ... the most gorgeous person to EVER grace this earth! He's absolutely marvelous as playboy Nickie Ferrante, who finds himself falling quickly in love with someone other than his fiancee. I have never seen chemistry on screen like this! Although the movie may be classified as \"sap\" or \"a love story\"... it's got it's funny moments (\"Do you think it will ever take the place of night baseball?\", \"Top of the mornin' to ya!\"--\"And the rest of the day to you!\"). But there are some scenes that just absolutely take your breath away... like when they are visiting Nickie's grandmother (in my opinion, the point that they realize their deep love for each other). Also, when they meet their fiancees in New York and while Terry's hugging Ken, Nickie gently kisses his fingertips and places them on her glove, and then she holds her glove to her cheek. Truly divine. However, the defining moment of this film (believe me, you better have some hankies handy!) is at the end... the look on Grant's face whenever he sees the portrait is PRICELESS. And of course, Kerr's voice trembling at the words \"Darling, don't look at me like that.\" I give this movie a definite 10.",
         "There is a reason why \"An Affair to Remember\" has remained a classic over the years. It contains all the elements the audience is looking for in an entertaining film. It has two marvelous stars, a timeless plot, and it transports the audience to a different world. I think it is almost impossible for a movie with Cary Grant in it to be anything other than first rate entertainment. Not only is he handsome, charming, and sophisticated, but he also knows how to grab the viewers' attention and manage to keep. Each time we see his movies,connects with us in a way that fascinates us, and yet it is comforting and familiar. Deborah Kerr is a lady who knows how to capture the audience's heart. She can always manage to get us rooting for her. I love \"An Affair to Remember\" because it showcases the incomparable talents of my two favorite stars at their best. I know some people say that this movie is too sentimental and corny, but part of its allure is that it is not too realistic. It gives us an escape into the ideal world where everyone is good looking and charming. Nowadays, movies like to play on the realism of life. This movie is for all the romantics out there who are looking for a film to fall in love with!",
         "What one has to consider about the Deborah Kerr/Cary Grant characters is that they are both \"kept\" individuals: Kerr by a wealthy Texan named Ken (-doll, played by Richard Denning), Grant a gigolo engaged to an heiress (Neva Patterson). They meet on an ocean cruise, with this some cute and also silly comedy thrown in. Kerr & Grant are British and speak the accents yet their characters are from the U.S.; a not too distracting error, however. An unusually touching scene is when they de-bark in Italy and visit Grant's 82-year-old grandmother (Cathleen Nesbitt). It's a beautiful setting with wonderful music and pathos. Back in the states the couple agree to meet atop the Empire State Building in 6 months. One wonders why Kerr won't marry the handsome Denning, athletic, wealthy and kind (in real-life the actor was married to the British-raised actress Evelyn Ankers, a beauty in the Kerr-mold). Much of the second half is infused with un-necessary scenes of singing children but this all leads up the the final, long scene, beautifully acted and directed (by Leo McCarey). A mystery is very slowly unraveled in layers until the peak of the scene, scored by the emotional title theme song. This scene \"gets\" one every time, that's how effective it is. Beautiful costumes, scenery, clever photography (note the scene where the open patio door reveals the Empire State Building in its reflection), great cast make this an enduring, never-forgotten golden classic.",
         "This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again due to its sweet nature and its refreshing look at how the world used to be. It is quaint yet still touching to those of us viewing it 50 years later. It is still relevant and it is still wonderful to watch the chemistry between the charismatic Cary Grant and the beautiful Deborah Kerr. The movie is a reminder of how simple things could make you laugh back in days when comedy was not sarcasm or needing negativity to be funny. \"An Affair to Remember\" is a wonderfully beautiful movie that creates a wonderful sense of how romance should be. It's lasting quality can be seen in other movies that have followed by deriving inspiration from the use of the Empire State Building as an iconic tower representing romance and this is a testament to the importance and relevance of this movie decades later. Plus, Cary Grant is still a cinematic icon 50 years later. This is a beautiful movie than spans time and still touches hearts this many years later. And it will continue to touch hearts for many years to come.",
         "Why do people hate this movie so much? It is a wonderful film , Cary Grant is so handsome and sexy,in my opinion -the sexiest man to ever have walked this earth.. and Deborah Carr is terrific as the love interest. The shipboard fun and the kiss on the stairs , i know if Cary had kissed me i would have gone crazy. The beautiful scenes in France and the shipboard romance were terrific. I do admit that the musical numbers involving the children were very unnecessary and somewhat annoying adding too much extra time to the film but they needed to show her life after the accident I guess. A shame that Deborah Kerr did not sing ,her voice was dubbed in this movie as well as in the King and I by Marnie Nixon but she was the leading lady and they needed a singing voice for her . That last scene where Cary sees the painting and the truth hits him , he is so overwhelmed with emotion that he wants to almost cry. I love that scene , I could watch it over and over again . go watch with your favorite sweetheart and a good cuddly sofa. 4 out of 4",
         "\"An Affair to Remember\" is an almost perfect film. It is as deep and rich as it is stylish and romantic. And if someone tells you it is just a soap opera -- that person would be very, very wrong. Yes, the film has style to burn. Deborah Kerr was never more beautiful. Her skin looks like cream; her pert, pinched nose like a blossom. She's never been more appealing than she is here. The scene where she smiles from a boat at her fiancé on shore alone is worth the price of admission. Cary Grant seems to sleep in tuxedos. He is a walking model of male perfection. Less observant viewers come away from this movie thinking that nothing happened, that nothing was ever at stake, that nothing was risked or gained. How wrong they are. Kerr's amazing dresses -- how about the one with the pumpkin colored ribbons woven through the front? -- Grant's suavity, and the south of France settings are not just there to pose for the camera. All of the beauty of this film is there to do very hard work -- to tell a less than beautiful story. And, no, this is not a movie where nothing happens. Something is happening in every scene -- you just have to be paying attention, and you just have to be mature enough, or have your antenna up high enough, to catch the subtle messages the film is sending, and to feel in your own solar plexus, the resonances of loves, dreams, and selves risked and gained, or lost. Nicki and Terry are both gambling much here. They are wounded people in a world of high glamor; they speak in arch codes, even as their hearts are bleeding, or their breath is caught against the cage of dreams. Grant's character, Nicki Ferrante, is a lazy gigolo. \"Gigolo\" is a pretty word for an ugly situation. Ferrante is a talented artist, but he knows that he can market something else he does -- seduce women -- far more easily, and for a higher price, than he can get for his paintings. Kerr's character, Terry McKay, as she says, had to grow up very fast, and fight off a boss who -- well -- she faced some bad stuff in her life. When a steady, but less than thrilling, man offered to set her up, she, no fool, took the offer. These are two beautiful people swanning through life over some very ugly circumstances. They have both sold their best selves for easy money. And, then, completely by chance, on shipboard, they meet their soul mates. This meeting doesn't just present them with an opportunity for a one night stand. It demands that they face their own fears, and become their best selves. I'm one of those cynical people who doesn't believe in love, never mind soul mates, but this movie carries it all off so well, it makes me believe. Grant and Kerr begin with the lightest, and subtlest, of exchanges. they say things to each other -- example: \"I'd be surprised if you were surprised\" -- that, if you are not paying attention and that if you don't know a lot about life -- would just go over your head. Slowly but surely their effervescent, and yet irresistible, attraction becomes truly heavy. The scene with Grandmere Janou (Cathleen Nesbit) is amazing for all it says, without actually saying anything. I could see a naive film-goer taking in that scene and then asking, \"What was the point of that scene?\" You really have to have your eyes on the screen, and have a sensitivity to human interactions. Who is looking at whom; whose face is suddenly hidden and why; who is saying what without actually saying it; and why does the sound of that boat whistle bring tears -- you have to be willing to pay attention, and to have a sense of life and human relationships, and, yes, an openness to the possibility of there being a God to understand that scene. Here you have a man and a woman who have, basically, sold themselves to the highest bidder, and who, at that point, are perilously close to cheating. What happens? Their love is blessed by the Virgin Mary. Heavy stuff. \"We changed our course today.\" Truer words were never spoken. I've got to hand it to Leo McCarey, who wrote and directed this film as well as the Academy Award winning \"Going My Way.\" He so wonderfully brings the best, and most complex, aspects of Catholicism to the screen here. Catholicism is associated with the romance languages -- French, Italian -- and it also is friendly to this kind of romance -- a romance where fallen beauties are blindsided by the kind of tortuous, redemptive, overwhelming, fated love that demands, and gets, everything, after which, you are never the same. If you haven't seen the movie, or \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" I won't reveal the ending to you. I'll just say that merely thinking about the ending can make me cry such tears as, really, very few films I've ever seen can make me cry. These tears are their own species.",
         "This film has to be probably the best romantic film I've ever seen, even above Gone With The Wind, but on the same level as The English Patient (my favorite film of all time). I got intrigued by this film back in high school when my sister dragged me to see Sleepless in Seattle. I caught the references to this film that Meg Ryan made throughout that film and thought that I'd like to rent this film (Affair to Remember) to see what the commotion was about. Needless to say, with the whole \"shipboard romance\" aspect of it, and the promise to meet again in six months atop the Empire State Building of all places, I quickly became hooked. The scene on the French Riviera with Nickie's grandmother playing the piano, oh God is it beautiful! Cary Grant is so debonair and suave and Deborah Kerr is so ravishing and stunningly beautiful, that it always demands repeated viewing from me (at least three times a year). Seeing this film always makes me wonder if something like the kind of relationship that Nickie had with Terry in the film would really be possible. Would and could someone actually leave the person they were engaged to to marry a complete and total stranger that they just met days ago? I'd like to think that it could, but then I am nothing but a hopeless romantic. The final scene always tears my heart out, no matter how many times I've seen it, I'm always sobbing. Watching this film around Valentine's Day (even if you are single) is always a treat. It allows our fantasies to take flight so that we may think that we are actually the one meeting our beloved atop the Empire State Building in a thunderstorm. Watch with a box of Kleenex nearby. My rating: 4 stars",
         "Grant's charming philanderer Nicky Ferrante, a renowned bachelor, and Kerr's American nightclub singer Terry McKay meet aboard a transatlantic luxury liner steaming back to New York via Naples and surrender\u0097in the midst of good humor\u0097to their undeniable chemistry\u0085 Unfortunately, both are hampered with others lovers\u0085 At the end of the voyage, they make a promise\u0085 In six months, if both are free they will reunite at the top of the Empire State Building, \"the nearest thing they have to heaven in New York.\" In the day of the meeting, the reformed Grant put his paintbrushes away and luckily paces the skyscraper's roof, but Kerr, looking up to heaven to see him, is involved in a serious accident\u0085 What fallows is almost unbelievable as Grant yields to pompous cynicism, unaware Kerr is too proud to let him know the truth\u0085 With four Oscar nominations, and with attractive settings as the French Riviera, and two appealing beautiful people sharing pink champagne, Leo McCarey's pretty good romantic film gives off flashes of gaiety and sways with longing hearts to be filled with love and life\u0085",
         "If you think you cannot stand another headline about people trying to blow up airplanes with shoe bombs, when you are on the verge of depression because the world is so hard and immoral and unkind, when you want to return to the Good Old Days of the 1950's, then plop this video into your player and watch two film STARS give lovely sweet performances in a GROWN UP, sensitive film called \"An Affair To Remember\". Ok, ok, so the Catholic touches go a bit overboard (Kerr in the chapel praying to the Virgin like a good Catholic, while she is a kept woman and playing around on her fiance with Grant, the little kids singing about hell and the devil, etc.) but other than that this film is romantic and enjoyable, nostalgic and fun. The two main characters grow emotionally and spiritually during the course of the film. That does not happen too often in modern films. And you don't forget this film once you have seen it. It stays with you, it haunts your consciousness and your memories. How many modern films can you say that about? I forget their plots 10 minutes after I am out of the theater. Not this film. You don't want this film to end: you want to see the couple get married, have children, see them successful in their careers, grow old together (and you know they do).",

      "plotSummary": "Nickie Ferrante's return to New York to marry a rich heiress is well publicized as are his many antics and affairs. He meets a nightclub singer Terry McKay who is also on her way home to her longtime boyfriend. She sees him as just another playboy and he sees her as stand-offish but over several days they soon find they've fallen in love. Nickie has never really worked in his life so they agree that they will meet again in six months time atop the Empire State building. This will give them time to deal with their current relationships and for Nickie to see if he can actually earn a living. He returns to painting and is reasonably successful. On the agreed date, Nickie is waiting patiently for Terry who is racing to join him. Fate intervenes however, resulting in misunderstanding and heartbreak and only fate can save their relationship.",
