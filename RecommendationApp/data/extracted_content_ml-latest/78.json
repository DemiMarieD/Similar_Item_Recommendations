         "Most films you see nowadays are directed from a very logical standpoint: the plot is mapped out and it's followed to a T, and the ending neatly wraps things up so that when you leave the theater, you feel relieved that things worked out. But every now and then, a film-maker will make a picture from a purely emotional standpoint. Rather than creating a structured outline, he'll rely on the ambiance of each scene to compose a more true to life -- if at times incoherent -- piece of storytelling. The Crossing Guard is such a film. Directed by actor-turned-film-maker Sean Penn (whose first effort was 1991's The Indian Runner), it is a meandering, ponderous movie about grief and the value of life, and while at times it seems unbalanced, the end result is quite stunning. The film opens with what may appear to be a perplexing correlation: first we see a woman sitting silently in a support group for parents who lost their children, and then we cut to a man drinking heavily in a strip bar. The woman is Mary (played by Anjelica Huston), and the man is Freddy Gale (played by Jack Nicholson), and together they were the parents of a little girl who was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver named John (Wilkes?) Booth (played by David Morse, who was also in The Indian Runner). And while they may be dealing with it in totally different ways, they are both having difficulty coping with the loss of their child. But when John is released from prison, Freddy suddenly announces to his now ex-wife Mary that he will kill him in an attempt to relieve their pain. The premise is indeed stale, but by showing it in such a different light than its similar predecessors, Penn manages to create genuine intensity from what would otherwise be another Death Wish sequel. Nicholson delivers yet another amazing performance, and after seeing him in so many tough roles, it is truly shattering to watch him break down in tears. And while I personally felt that Morse was miscast, he still does a terrific job with the role. Anjelica Huston and Robin Wright Penn are top-notch, but honorary mention must be given to Priscilla Barnes (\"Three's Company,\" Licence to Kill), whose subtle grace makes her near-insignificant character beam with humanity. Also, keep your eyes peeled for an appearance by Piper Laurie (Children of a Lesser God, \"Twin Peaks\") as John's loving mother. In the end, The Crossing Guard is a film about family: all of the characters' actions are done out of love, which brings Freddy's dilemma over whether or not to avenge his daughter more close-to-home than it might otherwise have been. Penn's direction is excellent, but at times he tries a little too hard to provoke emotions that don't come naturally. The Crossing Guard isn't quite as powerful as it wants to be, but it comes very close. It's one of the most over-looked pictures of the decade. SIDE-NOTE: In a scene where Priscilla Barnes is pouring her heart out to Nicholson while he's lying in bed smoking a cigarette, there's a close-up of his hand, and you'll notice that he has a ring on his ring finger. Later on in the film, when he and his ex-wife are talking in a diner, the ring is still there ... but it has switched to his pinky finger. This is the kind of absolute characterization that makes The Crossing Guard more special than you might think it to be upon first glance. Grade: B",
         "\"The Crossing guard\" is not a completely typical or usual thriller. When it comes to actors David Morse has an incredibly nice, gentle and friendly looks. It's really hard to imagine him playing twisted criminals and psychopaths. On the other hand Jack Nicholson's looks - as we all know - are one of the most dreadful and devilish there is. His sinister eyes and evil expressions were the vitality of the movies like \"The Shining\", \"The Witches of Eastwick\", \"Batman\" or \"Wolf\". The secret behind the suspense of \"The Crossing guard\" is to put these two men in the same film and make Nicholson's character Freddy Gale hunt down David Morse's John Booth. The latter is responsible for the death of Gale's daughter Emily but he's not a bad man. He made a mistake, went to prison for it and is trying to keep on living with dead girl on his conscience. This splendid, interesting idea works perfectly. The last picture of \"The Crossing guard\" is very emotional, very touching and it wraps the whole film beautifully together. Thrilling \"The Crossing guard\" is Jack Nicholson's finest performances of the 90's and probably the best one of the three movies Sean Penn has directed so far. Watch it!",
         "A strange movie. That's what I thought when I first saw this a decade ago. It was one of those films I thought about a couple of days later and couldn't get out of my head for a short while. When I saw it again a few years ago I almost had the same reaction. What's different about this film is the message: forgiveness. That's really what it's about and it's done in a touching way even though most of the characters in here are anything but nice, sentimental people. If you can enjoy a good character-development story and not get too dismayed by a depressing scene or two this movie will reward you with some intangibles that are hard to describe unless you've seen this. Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Angelica Huston and Robin Wright make for an interesting foursome, I'll say that. Nicholson, particularly, impressed me with an untypically-subdued role for him. (Note: The profanity and nudity in here was totally unnecessary and the film would have been better without it. The story was powerful enough on its own.) If you don't like this movie, I would understand that, too. It's not an easy film to like. It will either haunt you or put you to sleep. It haunted me.",
         "A powerful and compelling story, filmed well and with some great performances. Sean Penn seems to have managed to level the actors here, with David Morse, Anjelica Huston and Jack Nicholson putting in great performances and none of them stealing the scenes from the other. I found this very surprising as I expected Nicholson to flood the screen, as he so often does with such little difficulty. However, the emotion between Huston and Nicholson in the latter half of the film during the coffee shop scene is so powerful to watch. Huston is such a wonderful actress, and Nicholson shows some emotional depth that I haven't seen before, or rather, not felt with his performance before. The story is written and planned extremely well, with tension rising slowly and almost imperceptibly, until the final day. I found myself caught from the opening scenes of the counselling session cut with the drunken, partying Nicholson, right through to the pivotal moments of the main characters lives. It is a fantastic way to address this subject. To examine it from both sides, and keep each side with its own sympathies and understandings. Cleverly your sympathies and hatred are swapped throughout the story. I hope there's more to come like this.",
         "I puzzle at those reviewers criticizing this film, which to my mind is a tour de force. Of course, I do volunteer work with dying folks and help train aspiring grief counselors to deal with the traumas that life all too often brings us. I can only assume that those who so quickly dismiss this powerful meditation on grief and remorse have yet to experience these real life emotions. Something by Schwarzenegger may be more to their taste, or one of the ubiquitous comic book recreations we encounter most summers with cardboard characters and pseudo emotions. Sean Penn is plumbing much deeper regions of the human psyche, and doing so with actors of rare talent, fully capable of sharing with us their heart rending vulnerabilities. Few actors have the courage to go to the places these actors visit as they face suffering almost too great to bear. I'm reminded of the more recent Mystic River for which Sean Penn received an Academy award for best actor, a movie that explores equally traumatizing events. It was heartening to watch the joy with which this award was greeted by his fellow professionals who have long acknowledged this man's genius both in front of and behind the camera. This movie deserves a much wider audience of discriminating movie viewers.",
         "with such a good cast, I was shocked I had not heard of this movie. But after watching it, now I understand. It was a pretty good idea for a movie, but not executed very well. I just felt like Sean Penn had all these great ideas and grand schemes for an intense movie. But instead of focusing in on one solid motif, he threw too many concepts and character issues into the mix. The entire stripper / sexual sub plot with Jack could have been completely left out. There was not a lot of depth behind the acting, it was just kinda there. Like I mentioned, the plot line kinda skated on the surface of being deep. Nothing about the movie really touched me. Especially considering I lost a family member in a similar way, I thought I would be crying my heart out. But honestly I found it barely entertaining. But if nothing is on TV and the internet isn't working, I suggest watching it.",
         "David Morse was excellent in the movie. Whenever he's on screen, the movie is worth watching. Jack Nicholson is his usual competent crazy guy. The subject makes the movie a Serious Topic movie, but it often has trouble staying on topic. The movie itself is mostly very slow going, aside from Morse's scenes and the scene where Nicholson talks to his ex-wife about a dream. How many times do we need to see Nicholson's character hanging out at the strip club? Yes, we get the idea, he's turned into a sleazebag with no direction in his life. The ending is what really saves the movie. Beyond that, no spoilers from me. Once you get the idea of how Nicholson acts in the strip club, you might as well fast-forward through the strip club scenes (unless you want to see the strippers do their thing), because they're all pretty much the same. Still, that ending is just so good the movie ends up feeling pretty decent.",
         "Spoilers herein. Two men, one running from death, the other advancing toward it. The meet and exchange roles. Two powerful, explosive actors (Nicholson and Huston) and two controlled, technical actors (Morse and Wright Penn). Two off-screen relationships both stressed and introspective: one goes forward (Sean and Robin), one does not (Jack and Angelica). Two dancers: one has a child at home; one is a child -- both seek fathers. Sex and love; awakening and alcoholism -- but these are old. Jewelry put on and clothes taken off. Literal and virtual prisons. Buses and boats. Robin and Verna as dancers. Slow motion in vision and slow awakenings. In the Egoyan tradition of character-driven symmetries. This is worth watching if only because Penn understands how to place talented actors in motion in folded spaces. All else is irrelevant in this case.",
         "Those posters who yearn for action, action, and yet more action should rate the movies they are most fond of and leave those with depth and feeling the hell alone. Guys you are about as deep as a puddle in the street. Sean Penn did an incredible writing and directing job. He assembled an all-star cast and directed them with such skill that no one performance overshadows another, yet all of them are powerful and provocative. It's really great to see David Morse in yet another fine performance. This guy is totally under-rated. Jack Nicholson is, as always, at his finest. Anjelica Huston turns in another powerful performance. It was also good to see Priscilla Barnes after many long years doing a credible, no excellent, portrayal of the \"bad girl\" with a soul. If you want to see a film that actually has some depth see this one.",
         "Now I must start by saying that personally I vehemently dislike Sean Penn. I think his ego is so enormous that it almost always oozes out of his performances making them dripping with sarcasm and over acted scenes. He has done some good films both recently and in the past but overall he thinks he is far better than he is. However it wasn't until the credits rolled on The Crossing Guard that I knew Mr. Sean Penn himself had directed and wrote this powerful film and kudos to him because he did an incredible job. The Crossing Guard is gritty, dark, bleak, a sad and depressing look into grief and death that will not bring you to tears but rather horror at how deep grief can take someone. That someone that we see gives such a powerful performance that I might go so far as to say that it is one of his best performances if not THEE best to date. Penn must known something about grief and the dark place a human can go because he captures the emotion like no other film I have ever seen and perhaps he owes a big part of that to his cast. I am still completely confused by the title...I mean I get that The Crossing Guard watches Nicholson's character as he almost makes his kill but other than that I don't make the connection. But title aside this is a must see film!! Jack Nicholson plays Freddy Gale, the completely distraught, hopelessly depressed and lost father of a young girl killed by a drunk driver that spiraled his life into hopelessness. He lost his wife, his two sons who now know his ex-wife's new husband as \"Dad.\" He's got questionable business practices running a seed Jewellery store, and his only friends and hang out are in a strip joint. Gale is such an intriguing and incredibly depthy and emotional character. I have never seen Nicholson embrace a character like this and take the film goer on such an incredible ride of emotions. This is a Nicholson MUST SEE performance and he should have been praised to no end for this role. It's under rated and his best and he's done some incredible work. The role of Freddie Gale is like this fragile bomb that is falling apart and ready to explode at any moment which is a suspenseful character to say the least. Anjelica Huston brilliantly plays Freddie's ex-wife Mary whom still cares for her ex-husband but has tried to piece her life back together after the death of their daughter. Huston and Nicholson's scenes together are stunning and her character is a showing of grief from a completely different perspective but just as interesting. She is very good in this performance and Golden Globe nominated which is deserved but a sham considering Nicholson was shut out. The incredible David Morse rounds out the main cast as the man who killed their daughter John Booth. Booth has now just been released from prison and must try to fit into society all the while dealing with his own guilt and grief for the murder he committed. He is equally as emotional and depthy as any of the other characters and once again shows another side of grief to the story. I can't speak enough about the absolute brilliance of this film. It captures pain and emotion like no other film I've ever seen and brilliantly and perfectly shows it from three very different angles and each one just as powerful as the next although we are seeing the story through the eyes of the completely devastated and angry Freddy Gale. The tone of the film is so depressing and brings you through such a range of emotions it's almost hard to bear. I definitely don't recommend this film to anyone who has lost someone recently because it's a tough film to watch but important and so powerful. An absolute classic that is not treated like one...a rare and stunning piece of cinema. 10/10"
