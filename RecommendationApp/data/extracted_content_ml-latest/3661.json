         "content": "_A worthy sequel, a worthy odyssey_. This film sort of picks up where the first left off (a few months later, so you have to fill in a few blanks), as a group of paranormal investigators can't help but pay the old hotel a visit.\r\n\r\nDirecting this one is David Allen, the hand behind the puppet-effects of Puppetmaster. Andre Toulon makes an appearance here (in fact he appears throughout the entire film), and has his previously-deceased eyes on Carolyn, who resembles his long-dead wife. But what does he plan to do if he abducts her, and will it be in accordance with the puppets' plans? These are the questions that will be answered, per se.\r\n\r\nThe puppets have been killing not only people, but animals as well, and Toulon seems displeased with the latter. The newest puppet in this one is Torch, and he wastes no time exterminating members of the human race. Two of the puppets die in this one (they shall remain nameless), the first of which is dissected immediately afterward.\r\n\r\nUnlike the original, this one's shot almost exclusively in daylight, but it doesn't seem to hurt the film, as the performances are adequate (and Toulon's appearance, suitably grotesque). In this sequel: Toulon claims he \"knows how to get into things\", and if you have any sense at all, you'll get into watching this film. 7/10",

         "The murderous puppets from part one (plus a new, fire-jetting doll named Torch) resurrect the long-dead corpse of their original puppet master, Andre Toulon. For some reason, Toulon is now an evil, spiteful b**tard who entices the little creatures to murder people and extract their brain tissue in order to create a serum which will reanimate his wife. Meanwhile, a group of government parapsychologists (is there really such a profession?) are conducting research at the eerie hotel (using a Commodore Amiga!) where both the puppet master and his creations dwell. As you would expect, they are not happy with the unwelcome visitors and decide to slaughter them all. The Full Moon company has outdone themselves yet again with this eye-opening feature, complete with awesome puppetry and mind-blowing special effects. The story seemed a little flat at times but it was told well enough to peak your interest for the duration of the film. The same eerie soundtrack from part one is reused here.",
         "A lot of people consider this to be best out of the series but, I'm gonna haft to disagree with that but it's by far not the worst and you PM fans know what I'm talking about. There's just something really strange about this film, I think it's because towards the end of the film it gets really really far out and creepy. After mutilating there selfish and evil Puppets Master, The puppets Blade, Pinhead, Jester, Tunneler and Leech Woman are back to resurrect there sweet and kind Puppet Master Andre Toulon but he's no longer sweet and kind, he's a psychopathic, evil, and greedy zombie that wants to kill the investigators of the Bodega Bay Hotel and in Andre's insane mind, he thinks one of the investigator is his wife incarnated. The film introduces us to a new puppet by the name of Torch, who is a robot puppet that shoots flames out of his right arm, I still think Blade is the best though.",
         "Granted, this is only a B-movie, it still delivers an atmosphere of dark, moody suspense. Nothing like Suspiria did, but none the less, Puppet Master II far exceeds the first by several turns. The puppets are more believeable in this one. They don't appear to be as bland as in the first; they have more movement and actions. Toulon as the Invisible man, however, is one of the main low points of the movie. The acting is marginally better than the first...The actors aren't as...bored looking as in the first. The life-size puppets were a very eerie, and gave the film a new twist. While still under Paramount, Full Moon was able to present a decent Horror movie, with a much bigger budge than any of their $50,000 \"wonders\" they are putting out now. 7 out of 10",
         "If you haven't guessed by the title this is the second chapter of the classic Puppet Master series. I enjoyed this film more then the first film and I loved the first film. In this movie the new puppet Torch steals the show. A flame throwing puppet what's not to like? This film also features the classic scene where Blade chases Charlie Spradling out of her room into the hallway. If you're a fan of Fullmoon Pictures then this is a must see. If you're worried about the acting don't be, the acting was good. Not the best ever but pretty good. The ending of this movie was Excellent. It brings about the question, is the Puppet MASTER really the one pulling the strings?",
         "The puppets return, this time they hunt down some locals and paranormal researchers to assist their master in his evil plan. Charles Band's story and David Pabian's screenplay is almost a remake of the first film. Effects wizard David Allen in the directing chair exceeds the 1st certainly in terms of effects and atmosphere. While this installment reduces Andre Toulon / Eriquee Chaneé to a walking nod to the Invisible Man and other Universal classic characters, in contrast to how he is presented in the later adventures, it is by far the creepiest of the bunch. Steve Welles performance is wonderfully over the top and steals every scene. Veteran Nita Talbot is on fine form and the remaining cast are a mixed blessing, Charlie Spradling and Elizabeth Maclellan give solid performances while here at least Collin Bernsen and Jeff Celentano are as mechanical as Tunneler's innards. Despite it's editing and story flaws Allen gives us a darker faster paced and eerier film than it's predecessor. The flashbacks are welcome and the paranormal investigation angle, while not totally original, gives the proceeds some weight and intrigue. Notably Blade running and jumping from a bed to slice his victim is probably one of best low budget horror moments to date. There are many stand out moments in part 2, Leech Woman's demise, Torches encounter with a toy whipping boy and the unworldly human puppets reminiscent of the aliens in Carpenter's (1988)They Live to name a few. As with all the films in the Puppet Master series they always leave you with one burning question, in two's case: Why didn't Julianne Mazziotti/Nita Talbot's Camille get her own sequel with your favorite little puppets?",
         "The puppets return, this time they hunt some paranormal researchers to take their brain fluid for the living-dead puppet master, Andre Toulon (Steve Welles). This film has some good things going for it: first, more exposition on the background of the puppets. And second, a faster pace than the original film. Love it or hate it, the first film is a tad bit slow a times and really stretches material to fill its 90 minutes. Here we run into some continuity issues, which is pretty standard for the film. The so-called \"owner\" of the house... was he really in Bucharest, or was he actually at home during the course of the first film? I am uncertain. And then, where did he comes from? And why does he confuse a main character for his wife? There are more than few questions. However, the film looks slicker, and the villain is far more interesting this time around. And, thanks to the Blu-Ray release, you can watch in high definition and listen to Charlie Band commentary.",
         "Have you ever watched Child's Play? You know the movie that has the walking talking toy doll that runs around killing people. Well this movie is something very similar, only it features puppets instead of a doll. The credits draw you in, a cemetery and a puppet digging a grave really makes you wonder what'll happen next, then a pair of skeleton arms stretch up and roll the black screen and more credits. Puppet Master II draws you in from the first scene to the last. Who doesn't love seeing Blade, the puppet with the blade and hook instead of hands, slashing at unsuspecting peoples throats? What about Pinhead, the big puppet with huge hands and a tiny head, and his ways in strangling peoples necks? Hey, lets not forget Leech Woman who spits out leeches that suck out the blood of her victims and Jester, who hasn't a mean little bone in his wooden body. Okay, so four parapsychologists go to the Bodega Bay Inn, where the events of the first film happened, to look up on claims by Alex Whitaker from the first film. Leading them is Carolyn Bramwell (Elizabeth Maclellan), a down right nice girl. Her brother Patrick (Gregory Webb) is killed the first night at the hotel, thanks to Tunneler and might I mention he was drunk. Then Camille (Nita Talbot) goes missing, luckily she had a son named Matthew (George 'Buck' Flower). It's not long before the corpse from before, dressed in black and covered in bandages, appears and calls himself Eriquee Chaneé (Steve Welles). Events get stranger, Wanda (Charlie Spradling ) and Michael Kenney (Collin Bernsen) are murdered. Carolyn goes to confront Eriquee, whom she finds out is really Andre Toulon. He thinks she is the reincarnation of his late wife Elsa, and tries to put his and her soul into mannequins. Luckily, Blade intervenes and Andre is kill again for a second time. I recommend watching the first three, forget about the rest.",
         "Tunneler, Jester, Blade, Pinhead & Leech Woman are back to kill some more paranormal investigator types, this time once again under the thrall of the original Puppet Master, Toulon, after the puppets resurrect him, however zombie Toulon is a bit of a nut-case. However, he also made Torch, one of the more interesting puppets, in this outing. So it's all good. I found myself enjoying this film despite of major continuity eras. In some respects it may seem like a bit of a rehash of the previous film, but it moves at a quicker pace and features some pretty cool kills. All in all, it's on par with the first film. Eye Candy: Men get Charlie Spradling topless. The ladies get to ogle Collin Bernsen's posterior",
         "I love the Puppet Master series. I found out about this great franchise during the summer of 2012. After watching and loving the first film, I decided to watch number 2. And I was very pleased. Puppet Master 2 keeps the feel of the first film and did well in many categories. Average acting, good gore, nice kills, plenty of puppet screen time, a good storyline, and an awesome ending. What's not to love about that? Now, if you're just a horror film watcher and not a fan of Puppet Master, good ol' Charles Band or Full Moon films, I don't really recommend this film. Otherwise, grab some popcorn, some friends who are fans of Puppet Master, a comfy seat and enjoy! Puppet Master Forever!",
         "Puppet Master II is a good sequel to its predecessor. We are introduced to more of the mythology and a better look at the toys, including a few new ones. The story is good, the acting isn't great and the special effects are good...well for its time. This is definitely a fun film to watch, especially with friends and a keg of beer, or not depending on your taste. Like other great cult horror film classics you are introduced to a lot of corny moments, but that is what makes this film so amazing. The corniness is supposed to be there and it works. As for the VHS transition to DVD not looking good, I think the quality of it makes the cult of it even more enhanced. I like the VHS look, even if it is on DVD. It seems interesting and brings back a lot of memories from my childhood as I as taking my first steps into the horror genre. Definitely worth watching!"
