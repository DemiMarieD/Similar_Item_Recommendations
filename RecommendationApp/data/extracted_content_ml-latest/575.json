         "I've always loved this movie. I first encountered it when I was in 4th grade. We would almost always watch this or Alladin during our school parties. I am now almost 19 years old here in 2004 and I gotta watch this movie once in a while to recapture the good ol' days of my childhood. This movie is indeed really cute and good for the whole family. I remember my cousin borrowed it from me and I did not get it back for nearly three years because she loved the movie to death. I am just glad to see that some of kids have somewhat of a career after this. I was wondering what happened to Darla, Alfalfa and the gang. It's hard to believe that most of the Rascals are now high schoolers and growing up. As I write this review, I have an urge to watch the movie again. 10/10...loved it as a kid and as a young adult, I still love it!",
         "I can not believe some of the peoples comments about this movie being stupid. What did you expect from a kids movie, to come out of it feeling inspired? No, it's just a happy-go-lucky kids movie which i can proudly say i have watched over and over again to this day! And one user commented 'How do the kids expect to marry women in the future, with a Woman Haters club' ? Oh my god, get over yourself! Although i haven't seen the original to this, i can praise this version as a feel good film. The basic plot is about Spanky and Alfalfa, childhood friends, who have a group called the 'He-man Women Haters club' with their other pals Porky, Buckwheat, Froggy and so on. Though Secretly, Alfalfa loves girls and has a girlfriend,Darla, who he one day has lunch with in the Boys club! When the boys find out Alfalfa lied, they ruin his lunch with Darla (Kitty Litter sandwiches and so-called grape juice!). Unfortunately and accidentally, the clubhouse burns on fire, and the boys must enter a go kart race to win money to fund repairs for their clubhouse! An excellent movie whatever other people say! 9/10 and im sticking to it!",
         "Amazing , sweet ,little ,funny ,feel good cinema thats what \"The Little Rascals \" is all about .Quite amazing to see how small kids doing big deeds.The starcast is full of lovely kids and they make this movie a treat for the eyes to watch. The basic foundation of the Heman woman hater club shakes down when one of their member,Alfaalfa, falls for Darla and there it all starts the fight for Darla and the story moves ..... When the movie is over there is something which makes u feel good.Director penelope spheeris completely justifies the subject the movie needed a good screenplay and its brilliant in the movie. Overall a good delightful movie to watch.",
         "This is a true masterpiece of crazy-comic children films because, well for one thing, this is no disappointment to those who enjoyed the original Little Rascals series. A highly cute, funny, adorable film to anyone. True, the idea of a \"He-Man woman haters club\" is offensive to all you feminists out there, but remember the story of the film took place when these kind of things commonly happen. So what I have to say is this is an excellent-quality film for any little rascals, & besides the rascals in the film are kinda like \"Rugrats\" but they're in the proper age group of kingergarten, so if you love seeing cute kid hijinx by all means, see this film.",
         "I love this movie. To me it's one best kids movies ever, it just brings you back to those innocent times of being a child. It's fun, its cool, its when you start to notice girls for the 1st time. This is one for the ages. It still resonates with young kids today. It has genuine performances by child actors. It is everything you want in a kids movie and more. Big thumbs up from me It's girls will be girls Boys will be boys 5/5",
         "I enjoy movies where kids are the main stars, and except for a few, have always highly rated them. This ranks as one of the better ones I've seen. Though I never had the chance to watch the series, I can imagine how hilarious it must have been judging from the movie. The antics of the group of young boys and girls in their eternal 'war' against one another is uproarious and a delight to watch. Watch how one of the boys try to stay within the girl-hating club while trying to woo a girl at the same time - it'll remind some of us of our childhood just before we enter adolescence. Fact is, I think the parents would probably enjoy this just as much for the same reason - how cute we were before we became 'teen horrors'!!",
         "Imagine a group of kids from the 1930s somehow inhabiting a modern city. This movie made me and my kids so happy that we went back to see it again the next day and bought the video when it came out. Its theatrical run didn't last very long, so most people never saw it. Give it a try, especially if you're a kid or have kids of your own.",
         "I laughed my head off at these ill behaved little rapscallions. However, in the real world I would have cheerfully kicked their rascally little butts. Nothing realistic about the behavior of these kids at all, but I don't think that was intended. Lots of zany antics [some re-done from the old shorts from years back] and many belly laughs left me feeling good after the film was over. Thumbs up.",
         "To this day I can still remember seeing this film for the first time. I was about 7 and I thought it was so great. I am now nearly 21 and I still love this film. The casting is great and the acting was great for kids that young. The story was surprisingly well done as well! Probably adults won't enjoy this film as much but I think a good amount will. I definitely think kids will enjoy this film more then adults but as I said I am now an adult and I still am grateful to own this movie. I rate is 7/10 because there were some points in this film that were a bit unrealistic and a bit too silly. However I still think this film is great 7/10",
         "for those of you who seem to think this movie is terrible, you are quite closed minded. just as you have grown up with the originals, many children have grown up with this movie, i myself being one of them. this movie came out when i was seven i stil find just as enchanting now as i did then. i also grew up with the originals from my parents and still enjoy those. the old black and white films are not going to appeal to every child out there, which this movie was targeted at. in my opinion, this movie was meant to slightly bridge a generation gap. parents wanted their children to see this movie and, yes, relive their own nostalgia. it was marketed towards the kids and you have no right to judge a movie that you haven't grown up on and have seen as an adult. perhaps if you were a child when it first came out, you would appreciated a little more. i think it was a great idea for the film makers to remake these classics because it does bridge the generation gap a little bit more. obviously those of you that have seen it, its because of you nostalgia towards the old ones, or because of you children. either way, you should have great respect for those who inspired this movie. that future children will be able to enjoy it. i hope they do keep making remakes so one day my children can enjoy them as much as i have. their are some movies that you can't compare remakes to, one of them is casablanca. worst comparison ever."

His best friend, Alfalfa, has been chosen as the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, called \"The Blur\", in the annual Soap Box Derby style race. However, when the announcement is made, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found. The boys catch Alfalfa in the company of Darla -- \"a girl!\" Alfalfa isn't like his friends because he's in love with Darla, and unfortunately threatens the very existence of their \"boys only\" club. The club's members try their hardest to break the two apart, eventually causing their beloved clubhouse to burn down. Darla is mistakenly led to believe Alfalfa feels ashamed of her, so she turns her attentions to Waldo, the new rich kid whose father is an oil tycoon. Further trouble ensures when their prized go-cart \"The Blur\" is stolen by local neighborhood bullies Butch and Woim. How can they win the big race and its prize trophy?! In addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys now need a new set of wheels.
