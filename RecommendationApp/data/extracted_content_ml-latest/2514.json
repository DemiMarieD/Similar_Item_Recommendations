         "All right...I think that many commentators hate this film for what seems like good reasons, to them at least. And I agree that PS II is definitely not for everyone, maybe even not for fans of the original film - or even for fans of Stephen King.But there are things I enjoy about this film. I enjoy watching Clancy Brown chew up the scenery in the 2nd half of the movie after his character 'comes back'. Brown has a real gift for physical comedy and black humor, and he does a great job portraying a shambling revenant...he just radiates savage, hateful glee, and very effectively comes across as a...THING masquerading as a man, an agent of chaos and misery just barely keeping it together long enough to extract his revenge. PS II is worth watching just for his performance. I enjoy the way the plot spirals out of control after the opening events, as the two boys try to \"fix\" things early on by using the Pet Semetary to cover up their, um, \"mistakes\", only to find themselves completely over their heads. There are individual moments of mean-spirited gallows humor that are a lot of fun, and even a few good one liners - \"No brain, No Pain; Think About It, Won't You?\" was a screamingly funny line in the context it was delivered in. And the bit where Anthony Edwards staggers back into the Gilbert house and you hear 3 more shots was perfectly timed, and worth a chuckle. In fact, I feel that the entire movie seems to somehow embody the spirit and malice of whatever it is that brings the dead back from the Sematary. The director and screenwriter manage to make every scene, almost every shot, feel as if the \"wrongness\" of the Sematary has infected the very air and light of the town from the very opening shots. And in this, they may have been too successful. The glumness, the sense of oppression and airlessness and dread, the rot and gore and malice from beyond the grave are simply too much for the average film goer; if the director had backed off a little, and allowed a little more light into the mood and not rubbed our noses in the gore and blood and maggots quite so much, I think the results would have been more accessible for a lot more people. There a moments where I wish that we didn't have to see quite so many spurting wounds and decaying flesh and that not quite so many characters had gotten killed in the last 20 minutes. So...I think the movie was what the creators intended to make, but they may have misjudged the reaction most people would have to their creation. I can still watch this on occasion and admire the energy and effort put into bringing this \"feeling\" to, er, life.",
         "This is a sequel that has no connection to Stephen King. The only thing carried over from the original is the same location. Parts of this film are gory while violence over shadows the horror. This movie has been struck with a mean streak. A young widower(Anthony Edwards)moves with his young son (Edward Furlong)to an old town in Maine. After hearing the legend of the pet cemetery where sometimes the dead are revived; he wants to take his mother from her grave and place her in the special burial ground in hopes of her rejoining the family. The boy's best friend's stepfather is proof that the legend is true. Some of the strangest scenes are funnier than they are scary. But don't rest easy for there are times you will flinch. Also in the cast are: Clancy Brown, Jason McGuire and Lisa Waltz.",
         "Many will lump this into the sequels of Stephen King based movies, which is correct. This one was not written by King, but despite this lack of originality it is a fairly good sequel to an excellent movie. The mood is dark, just not as dark as the first film. We have Geoff and his veterinarian dad relocating to rural Maine (and the location of the Pet Sematary) after Geoff's mom is accidentally killed in front of him while shooting a movie. In their new small town, Geoff's dad opens up his own practice while Geoff has trouble adjusting to his surroundings. He befriends another outcast, Drew, who has an abusive stepfather named Gus to deal with at home. One night, out of meanness, Gus shoots and kills Drew's loyal dog Zowie. Drew then gets Geoff to help him bury Zowie in the notorious cemetery in hopes of bringing his dog back to life. It comes back, just different, mean and nasty, like it's mad about being resurrected and now hates everything and everyone (like all things brought back to life in the cemetery act). This starts off a chain of events that leads to the destruction of the lives of everyone involved (and some who aren't involved incidentally). Now its just a matter of who can survive the supernatural terror engulfing the town. The storyline is fun and the acting is good enough. The gore and other special effects are great. I can easily look past the bad points in a film and see the good in it. This film is like that for me. The film also posses qualities that make me automatically like it. It is an underdog film (meaning it's not very popular with most people on this site). It also has that early 90s disillusioned grunge youth generation feel to it. Some may see this quality as making the film darker, even mean-spirited, but I love that era and love its influence in movies. This is just the frosting on the \"cake\" for me, and overall the \"cake\" is worth a viewing on its own merits, even if it's just so you can judge for yourself.",
         "So i sat myself down today to watch the sequel to the famous movie \"Pet sematary\" and expected a half-assed thing made only to drain a little extra money from the Pet sematary fans. I was positively surprised though as the plot was interesting(A widower vet moves to the village from the first movie together with his son to start a new life) and so was the characters. The actors was also good and performed excellent especially the guy who played Gus(cant remember his name). He manages to actually behave like a gleeful psychotic man without going so far that his performance would evoke laughter instead of shivers. His performance is without doubt the best part of the movie. This movie is more gory than the original movie and has less of the psychological terror elements that were a big part of the first movie although this is rarely taken too far, a few moments of the movie features over-the-top goriness but not enough to make it ridiculous in any way. To sum it up: Pet sematary 2 is a good horror movie featuring both psychological terror as well as gore, the simple yet interesting plot as well as the performance of the actors makes this a movie well worth seeing.",
         "I like this movie. Has a few flaws though. First is; Yeah, I'll agree, a sequel to the original Pet Semetary isn't as the best of ideas. In the original, all the main characters bar one are dead so you can't use them so it will have to be a brand new story with brand new characters. As it is a brand new story, treat it as such and you will enjoy it. Like in many movies, I try to place myself in them and work out what I would do. OK I wouldn't have buried Gus nor the dog and nothing would have gone wrong but that would render the movie pointless. In making it, I would have left out the doggie dream and given Drew and his mother a better chance to survive. Said enough there. More gory, not as scary as the original but worth a look.",
         "After witnessing the onset death of his actress mother in a most implausible way (what movie crew would use a metal fence with their actors near electricity?), child of divorce, Jeff (Furlong), is off to live with his dad permanently and must accept the fact that his parents will never get back together. Or will they? Director Lambert makes the returned dead a bit more interesting this time by making them more intelligent and cunning. Unfortunately this was primarily used as a means to portray a lot of cheesy and cheap \"shocks\" and even unexplained motives for the Gus (Clancy Brown) character. Gone is the endearment and tragedy of the original; substituted with excessive gore f/x and spiteful characters. Furlong, who managed to impress in his early roles with characters who had similar family of origin problems (Terminator 2, American Heart, Brain Scan, A Home of Our Own), doesn't do much here outside of sullen glares, cuss and cry \"Mom!\" (literally) a number of times. Overall cheesy fun for horror fans but a flop in the character and scare departments. Hard to believe Mary Lambert, director of the first film, is responsible for this major disappointment of a sequel to the superior original. The ending suggests a setup for a sequel. I suppose we can all feel lucky this franchise remained buried after all.",
         "It's not gonna win any Oscars or even be remembered a few days after you see it, but what you have here is a good, solid horror film with lots of nice, bloody deaths and a fine performance by one Clancy Brown as a nasty sheriff... who isn't much nicer before he's resurrected. It has it's fair share of silly scenes, but makes up for it never giving us a moment's peace once things get going... and the last part is one big slice 'n dice after another. It's a better film than it's predecessor, and I was pleasantly surprised how much it gripped me. Worth a look. Two final thoughts: 1: It's nice to someone who understands that when you THINK a person who tried to kill you is dead, it's better to shoot their corpse repeatedly just to make sure. And 2: What happened to the cute kitten that goes walkabout in the second half without any explanation, only to reappear for the obligatory happy ending? Get Poirot on it now... 6/10",
         "The ancient Indian cemetery with the power to raise the dead returns and influences the lives of new residents. I must say, good or bad, I am glad director Mary Lambert returned for the sequel. As the first was her creation, it seems only fitting to let her take the characters and concepts where she wants to go with them. Had another director handled it, the film could have lost any flavor of the original that might exist. (There is some similar tone and such, which I think keeps it a strong sequel.) I love the young Edward Furlong (during his career peak) and Anthony Edwards with a beard. Great casting that keeps this film relevant even if it carried over pretty much nobody from the original. (I say \"pretty much\" because I think it has no one, but a minor character might have made it past me.) The film as a whole has received negative reviews, but the fact is that the original really is not that great. Although a modern classic, and a pop culture gem, it is not actually a critically good film. So the sequel by horror standards is not bad -- it actually maintains the level of the original.",
         "Honestly i don't look into stories just a good movie, i'd say Clancy Brown made this movie excellent, he is just too hilarious.. this movie i like evenly with the first one, Furlong could've done a better job though, The movie itself is more graphic than the first was, showed more detailed deaths and showed something else kinda nice.. overall though this movie was a mix between funny, sad, and scary, which makes it one of my favorite sequels, i dunno why a lot of people disliked it i didn't see anything wrong with it at the least, just didn't have much to do with the main story possibly could've been it could've happened like that or this but it wasn't complete without Fred Gwynne in it, he was as awesome as Clancy Brown, whew enough blabbing, just highly recommended for people who love violence and killing movies",
         "I have to say that Pet Sematary II was the biggest load of rubbish I have ever insulted my eyes with watching. I should have been forewarned with the bizarre spelling of \"cemetery\" -- why they didn't spell it correctly in the first place... I'll never know. What the hell was up with the ending credits with all that sad music and pictures of the people who died? It's not a -documentary-, it's a pathetic excuse for a thriller/horror film. The acting was dodgy, the script was bemusing and the plot was utterly ridiculous. The psycho zombie dog was mildly amusing, but I'm not sure it was supposed to be. What was the film trying to do? Was it a spoof of a horror film? It failed at an attempt to fit into any genre of film other than \"trash\". I found the entire movie to be contrived, boring and stupid, and I wouldn't watch it again even someone paid me!"

         "After his actress mother Renee Hallow is electrocuted to death before his eyes on the set of a movie she was shooting, Jeff Matthews and his veterinarian father Chase decide to move from Los Angeles to Renee's hometown of Ludlow, Maine - the town that houses the \"pet sematary\" - to live in the family's summer house so Jeff \"can get away from the craziness of Hollywood,\" according to Chase. Chase also hires a housekeeper, Marjorie Hargrove, who is a huge fan of Renee. There, Jeff has trouble fitting in at school, being tormented by school bully Clyde Parker for his mother's celebrity status, plus he can't stand Marjorie and her obsession with his mother and sometimes feels she's trying to replace her. He manages to befriend fellow outsider Drew Gilbert, the stepson of the town's sheriff Gus Gilbert, who was an ex-boyfriend of Renee. Gus runs the house he shares with Drew and his mother Amanda much like a jail, and Drew gets abused physically and verbally by Gus whenever Gus feels Drew is \"breaking the laws\" of the house while Amanda stands by and does practically nothing to defend her son from him. One night, Gus catches Drew's dog Zowie messing around his rabbit hutch for the umpteenth time, and then murders Zowie in cold blood. The next day, Drew decides to bury his dog not in the pet sematary, but in the cursed Micmac burial ground that lies beyond the pet sematary, his actions fueled by the stories of Louis Creed and Jud Crandall burying pets and people up there that came back to life. Jeff goes along with him to help with the burial. Zowie comes back, but he's definitely not the same dog that he was before he was killed, possessing a very malevolent demeanor that is evident by his eyes, which now glowed an eerie yellow. Gus grounds Drew thinking that he lied when he said the reason he missed school that day was so he could bury his dog. Not long after, on Halloween, Drew sneaks out to meet up with Jeff, Clyde, and a few others at the pet sematary to tell bonfire stories, but Gus learns of where Drew is at from Amanda and crashes the get-together. Angry that Drew \"broke the law,\" Gus starts beating him, but before Gus can really hurt Drew, Zowie emerges and violently kills Gus. Terrified about Gus' death, Jeff and Drew decide to take him up to the burial ground to try and resurrect him so no one would think he was ever dead. It works, but it is then that all hell breaks loose. Pretty soon, Jeff starts to wonder if maybe he should use the sinister power of the burial ground to bring his mother back to life.....",
         "The Pet Sematary continues with the dead rising, but we have new characters in this film. Jeff Matthews and Drew Gilbert. The story is mainly about Drew's dog Zowie gets shot by his father, and Drew has to his dog, and Jeff went along with him. They didn't bury him in the Pet Sematary, the buried him in the Micmac Indian Burying ground beyond the Pet Sematary, Drew heard about the story of Louis Creed and Jud Crandall burying pets and people up there, and so he decided to try it out. And soon, Zowie comes back with shocking results, and things get worse!",
