      "synopsis": "In California, jobless hippie and stoner Anthony \"Man\" Stoner (Chong) is kicked out of his house by his rich and classy father. He drives off in his fathers car, which breaks down, and Anthony is left stranded near a beach, left to sleep in a ditch over night with his belongings. The next morning, Chicano stoner Pedo De Pacas (Cheech) sets off from his Mexican-family-house in his lowrider car looking for love with errands to run. Pedro drives along the beach where he tries to pick up ladies, and sees Anthony with melons stuffed under his shirt. Assuming that Anthony is a large-breasted woman, Pedro drives his car around and tries to pick \"her\" up, only to be horrified when he discovers Anthony is just a guy looking for a ride. Feeling bad (and liking that Anthony likes his car), Pedro gives Anthony a ride, just missing being caught by the police. While driving, the 2 take a liking to each other being that they both like smoking marijuana. Pedro offers Anthony a small joint, while Anthony shows Pedro a huge joint, made out of dog feces (being that the dog ate Anthony's stash). The 2 smoke the joint and get incredibly high, followed by Pedro accidentally swallowing a lot of acid. The car crashes into a light pole, and the 2 are arrested and the car towed away. In a small courtroom trial, the 2 are being prosecuted when Anthony, still high, begs for water. Pedro grabs some of the judge's \"water\" for Anthony, only to have Anthony spit it out, revealing it to actually be vodka. With the judge taken away, Pedro and Anthony are let off free. The next morning, after Anthony meets (and argues) with Pedro's band (being that Pedro is a guitarist/singer and Anthony is a drummer), the 2 set off to score some weed. However, the town is dry being that many people are smoking pot these days. The 2 visit Pedro's cousin Strawberry, who is a retired war veteran who is a little messed up in the head and has a large \"birth mark\" on his face. Anthony stays in Strawberry's messy apartment while Pedro and Strawberry go off on a motorcycle to get weed. While in the apartment, Anthony meets Strawberry's roommate, a cokehead who throws a large drug party in the apartment. Meanwhile, Strawberry has a war flash and loses his mind and jumps off the motorcycle, sending Pedro crashing. When he crashes, he sees cops hiding outside the apartment, ready to bust in and arrest the druggies at the party. Pedro tries to warn Anthony via phone, which is bugged, and the party is busted. Pedro infiltrates the bust dressed like a re-po man, claiming he's there to reposses the stuff. The cops buy the story, and Pedro rescues Anthony. After that, the 2 visit Pedro's friends' place where the 2 get stoned, but not so much being that the weed is bad. At that point, immigration busts in, being that Pedro's friends calling immigration on themselves to get a free ride to a wedding in Mexico. Of course, Pedro and Anthony, despite their efforts to hide, get caught and deported to Tijuana as well. While in Tijuana, Pedro calls his uncle and gets the address of a upholestry shop and arranges to pick up a van to drive back to America. But after getting fast food over the address, the 2 arrive at the wrong place- an upholestry shop which is actually a marijuana plant in disguise. The factory actually makes materials out of solid and liquid marijuana, which is then smuggled across the border. The marijuana-made things made there are worth up to $9 million, and is heavily watched by police, led by Sargeant Stedanko. Pedro and Anthony show up to the factory, unaware of what it really is, and say they're there to pick up \"the van\". Rather than getting an actual van, the stoners get a huge green van, made from marijuana, top to bottom. From the steering wheel, the tires, the doors, the gas tank, to the very structure of the van itself, its all made of pure solid and liquid marijuana- and the guys have no idea they're smuggling it into America. The stoners drive their marijuana van to the border where they're stopped by police. Anthony is smoking a joint, which he throws out the window into the window of a car full of nuns. Pedro and Anthony are almost caught, when the police discover the joint in the nuns' car. The car is taken away and the nuns searched and arrested by Sgt. Stadenko and his police officers. Unaware of what they did, the hippies drive through the border back into America in their van, stopping at the border patrol station so Anthony can use the restroom. In the restroom, Anthony pees next to Stadenko and accidentally \"shakes himself dry\" on the sargeant's leg before leaving. An angry chief leaves the bathroom to have the officers tell him that they were wrong about the nuns, its actually 2 hippies in a big green van. Realizing who Anthony must've been and the green van was completely ignored, Sgt. Stadenko and 3 officers get in the police car and set off on the roads after Pedro and Anthony. It isn't long before the cops get sight of the marijuana van being driven by a Chicano and a hippie. They speed up, only for Pedro to get view of 2 hitch-hiking young ladies. He swerves the van across the highway, causing for the police to accidentally shoot the tires off their own police car. Pedro and Anthony (who have no idea cops are pursuing them), pick up the hitch-hikers and drive off. Pedro and one of the hitch-hikers make out in the back while Anthony drives with the other hitch-hiker. Meanwhile, Stadenko has fixed the tires and has continued the search, having no idea where the stoners could've gone. Pedro and Anthony learn from the hitch-hikers that they are actually heading for a battle of the bands concert in Los Angeles, with the winners getting a record contract. Excited, Pedro and Anthony decide to go to the battle of the bands with the ladies and compete. But first, they need to stock up on some weed. The 4 stop the green van at a police station, where a stoner female cop goes to get the 2 ladies illegal marijuana. Pedro and Anthony use this time to play with the intercom and police transmitter, taunting Sgt. Stadenko over the radio. At this point, Stadenko is really upset and he and his cops show up at the station. Stadenko goes to use the bathroom, where Pedro is. Pedro too \"shakes himself dry\" upon Stadenko's leg as Anthony did earlier and leaves, making Stadenko angrier. Pedro and Anthony and the girls, acquired with weed, return to the marijuana-made van and head on to the road again to Los Angeles. However, unknown to the 4, the gas coming out of the van is pure marijuana smoke, getting anyone who inhales really high. This occurs at the police station where someone near the van gets high and a case of the munchies, ordering multiple hamburgers from a nearby fast-food stand. While they drive along the highway, the smoke from the van spreads out the exhaust pipe, getting all driving by with their windows down really high. At one point, a police officer on a motorcycle speeds after them, but inhales the smoke and gets high, and forgets what he's doing. Pedro, Anthony, and the women get away, but the high cop is found by Stadenko, and, while high, reveals where the marijuana van headed off to, and Stadenko follows after the van. The van soon arrives in Los Angeles to the Roxy Theater where the battle of the bands takes place. Pedro and Anthony head into the theater and enter the competition, leaving the ladies behind. While inside getting ready, Anthony isn't feeling good so he takes some pills given to him by the hitchhikers- which turns out to be acid. Anthony slowly gets high, and the smoke from the van enters the vents backstage and gets both Pedro and Anthony very high as they prepare to go on. As a result, Pedro dresses in a pink tutu and a Minnie Mouse bow, while Anthony dresses in a red quaalude. Meanwhile, outside, Stadenko and crew have found the theater, and try to get inside, but are shooed off by real police men, being that they've left their badges in the car and don't have tickets. The van is almost towed away and Stadenko tries to take the van, but is denied the right to have it taken away. A billion dollar bust, gone. Stadenko and the cops hang around the van waiting for Pedro and Anthony, but get high off the smoke, and Stadenko is soon turned into a huge stoner (as seen in the movie Cheech and Chong's Nice Dreams) as the van burns down into nothing but marijuana smoke, getting everyone in Los Angeles really high. Back in the theater, it is Pedro and Anthony's turn to go on. The van has nearly burned down and all the smoke entering the vents has gotten everyone in the theater high. The 2 go on stage, really high from the van smoke, and almost knock over the band equipment. The 2 then play their rock song \"Earache My Eye\" (an actual song on a Cheech and Chong record), about a gay boy trying to live his life. The song is a big smash (even though Pedro had just written it and sang it as he went on), and Pedro and Anthony win the contest and the record deal, although still very high. Days later, Pedro and Anthony are back in California from their whole drugged-up adventure, driving in Pedro's lowrider on the street next to the beach where they first met. They're happy, talking about their new record deal and all the possibilities that can happen, when they decide to smoke some hash. Anthony smokes some and hands it to Pedro, who accidentally drops it in his crotch. Pedro's crotch starts burning up and he freaks out as he and Anthony try to put it out. The car crashes as the hash starts burning up, and Pedro and Anthony (Cheech and Chong), their car, and the record contract are all left, well, up in smoke.",

         "Of all the Cheech & Chong movies made, I think this one, their first, was their best. There's no real story line you have to follow. The point of this movie was to make you laugh. No messages or extra drama. It's the kind of movie to just sit back and laugh at. I do realize that this movie is definitely not for everyone. Some parents might not want to let their children see it and some people may not want to watch it themselves. The movie features a lot of drugs and some drug use (In case you're not familiar with Cheech & Chong movies). However, if you're not offended by that, and you've never seen this movie before, you should check it out for a good laugh!",
         "First of the Cheech and Chong movies is probably the best overall, with the duo involved in a plot to drive a van constructed entirely of pot across the Mexican border into the US and featuring Cheech singing \"Earache my Eye\". Lots of laughs (especially for the \"inspired\" viewers), but definitely not for everyone. The whole movie revolves around drug use, so not a movie for young children, obviously. However, if you don't mind this, you'll probably laugh your you-know-what off.",
         "This one of the movies I never get tired to see, it gets better for every time I see it. There are a lot of enjoyable characters, like Anthony Stoner, Strawberry, Harry, Stedenko, Jade East, The Ajax Lady and of course The Man and Pedro, you name it, the whole cast is excellent and there is great chemestry between the characters. There is also a great rhythm and great music in the movie. Sadly it`s seldom that this kind of movies are being made to day.",
         "Basically an excuse for Cheech and Chong to get into a series of marijuana adventures, \"Up in Smoke\" is a hoot from beginning to end. Pedro De Pacas (Cheech Marin) and Anthony \"Man\" Stoner (Tommy Chong) are a pair of slackers who wonder So Cal and Mexico looking for some weed, while the narcs look for any excuse to arrest them. There are some scenes that will probably make your eyes pop out, just due to the surprise factor. You just watch this sort of movie and think \"The '70s...those were the good old days.\" Also, it was interesting seeing Strother Martin and Edie Adams as Chong's character's parents. Seeing as to how they were part of my grandparents' generation, I wouldn't expect to see them in a marijuana movie.",
         "This 1979 Paramount release introduced the controversial radio comedians Richard \"Cheech\" Marin and Thomas Chong to the screen for the first of six major film teamings and cameos together in several other films. This first teaming is the best teaming. The duo portray stoners who travel together on a road trip down to Tijuana on a mission to pick up a fresh new drug supply. However, they're being pursued by frantic cops all the way. A cult spoof classic and a film that began a new kind of wacky film comedy.",
         "This is one of the greatest \"stoner comedy\" classics of all time. I rated this movie a 10 because it's current rating of 6.4 is an injustice to the comic genius duo that created it. It has it's weak moments but the overall strengths have influenced everything from \"Dumb and Dumber\" to \"Half Baked\" to \"Harold & Kumar\" ad infinitum. Cheech and Chong put their strongest stand up material on film and created a masterpiece of counter-culture satire that has yet to be surpassed. If you've never smoked weed, this movie probably isn't for you, though you still might find it humorous. This is a film for anyone who's been there and done that. It encapsulates a moment in modern Americana where drugs offer freedom and punk rock is the only redemption for alienated youths. These points are driven home with Abbot and Costello style absurdity and slapstick shenanigans as well as some very witty and inventive dialogue. I highly recommend this movie to anyone seeking drug related humor or a look into the mindset of young people in the late 70s.",
         "The counterculture was long dead and ripe for retrospective satire. Into the opportunity stepped two pro comics who after trying other things, built these characters. When comics work up a world for years and then brings it to a movie, it bodes well. Mike Myers would follow almost precisely this formula later with \"Wayne's World.\" The jokes are still pretty funny, many of them. Not the stuff with the flumoxxed cops or the folks who inadvertently get stoned (and get the munchies). But the bits of comic timing associated with the guys as if they were on stage. Two bits to watch out for. One is two incidental women. The first has a scene only a minute long. A girl comes in, mistakes scouring powder for coke, snuffs it up and has the most comic facial expressions I have even seen on film. This is one of those priceless moments in film. I hope IMDb at some point figures out some means to vote on particular scenes. This girl would in life become an addict and a bag lady. The second girl has a bigger role: Zane Buzby is one of the hippie stoner cheesecake babes that join the trip. She's got a less flashy role, but in ad libs created most of the situations in which she appears. She would go on to become one of TeeVee's most attuned comedy directors. So you can see this as two stage personalities that are good, with these two women, who are also as good, surrounded by some disposable situations and jokes. But there is another something interesting. The end of this comic show is a comic show within, the guys as a rock band in possibly the best Cheech and Chong sequence of all their movies. Everything from about 20 minutes into the film to this is a journey to this show, I suspect that \"The Muppet Movie\" of the following year was influenced by this. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",
         "Up in Smoke (1978) was the comic team of Cheech and Chong's big screen debut. After selling a ton of albums during the early and mid-seventies, the duo finally got a chance to star in their own picture. Anthony \"Man\" Stoner (Tommy Chong) is a rich kid who's still living the hippie life and enjoys pot. Pedro De Pacas (Cheech Marin) is a kid from East L.A. who's into three things: gaudy car upholstery, rock music and finding smoke. This would be the first of several movies starring these two characters (or different variations of them). Anthony Stoner leaves his rich parents house after a falling out over getting a job. His car breaks down near the ocean. But his savior arrives in the form of Pedro De Pacas. Pedro is cruising for girls when he meets Anthony. Th two strike up a friendship and the movie goes off in several different and bizarre directions. What kind of adventures do Anthony and Pedro get into? You'll just have to find out for yourself when you watch UP IN SMOKE. A funny film that'll keep you laughing from beginning to end. Tommy Chong and Cheech Marin play the ultimate slackers. All they want to do is partying and smoke a lot of dope. This movie was followed by several sequels. Highly recommended.",
         "Basically all Up in Smoke movies are about watching other people getting high, actually all the drug comedies are about that. It sounds kinda boring, but not when those people are Cheech & Chong. The scene where they were smoking in a car in the beginning is still funny to me, though I watched it many times. This movie is making fun more from the cops and other people who fight drugs, than from the drug addicts who just want to get high. This film shows how ridiculous those fighters against drugs look like, though this is a comedy, in my opinion, there is a lot of truth in this film. Maybe other Up in Smoke movies aren't that good as this one, but as I remember there is always at least few hilarious moments.",
         "When this first came out in the theaters I passed on seeing it as it seemed like Cheech and Chong's time had come and went. I was a big fan of their comedy albums of the early and mid 70's but the movie version of their act would have been logical then but by 1978 it's time had past. Of those who did see this in the theater I couldn't get a proper read on a critical review since I could find no one who saw it in a theater that wasn't high when they went. A year or two after it came out it showed up on one of the cable movie channels and I was expecting a typical movie that takes a funny five minute skit and stretches it out to a painful non-funny 90 minutes. Director Lou Adler had never directed a movie before. He had produced the documentary rock film Monetery Pop and the cult classic Rocky Horror Picture Show and Robert Altman's quirky Brewster McCloud but he was Pop music entrepreneur as a music producer, publisher, manager and record company founder. He would only direct one other film which is too bad because with his industry connections and reputation and his natural feel for talent and getting the best out of talent being a director worked very well for him as with the help of Cheech and Chong he turned out a very very funny movie with Up in Smoke. The counter-culture stoner comedy duo take a simple theme for a story outline but the great comedic timing and sight gags and fast pacing and an their inventive approach at film making takes what should have been a low budget stoner comedy to the next level of lasting cinematic comedy. Like a Marx Brothers or WC Fields or Charlie Chaplin comedy this movie has lasting power to entertain generations. Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong star in the first of series of funny movies from the duo. A strong character cast includes Strother Martin, Stacy Keetch, Tom Skerritt and Edie Adams. Look for Gary Muledeer and Ellen Barkin too. This movie had such broad appeal that some of the most red neck, anti-counter-culture, anti-hippy/freak/doper people I have ever ever known loved it. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10."
