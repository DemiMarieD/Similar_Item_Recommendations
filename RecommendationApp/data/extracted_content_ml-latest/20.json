         "Popcorn is the word that most describes this action-comedy movie from Joseph Reuben, the man who directed other standard fare like SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, TRUE BELIEVER, THE STEPFATHER, DREAMSCAPE, and most recently, a notorious bomb called THE FORGOTTEN. So let's see how I can dive into this pool without hitting a hard surface. This is a \"buddy-movie\" in which two uber-American guys of very different temperaments and backgrounds share a bond that goes beyond anything they might go through. One of the two is by default a loose cannon and drives the plot with his antics. There may be some tension when a corrupt high official threatens the loose cannon. Add a sexy new co-worker into the mix (which becomes the focus of their intense, male attraction) and basically you have a story that has been of late the norm in the Hollywood popcorn machine. Now, trying to cash in (I believe, I could be wrong) on their previous outing WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes play not buddies from the 'hood but foster 'brothas' (if we can believe this baby) who are closer than a cuticle is to a finger even though Snipes has to act as older brother to a rebellious and unpredictable Harrelson: and on that note, neither is miscast. Snipes does convey steel while Harrelson gives off his just-under-the-surface danger, especially when he grins at smarmy boss Robert Blake in one subway scene. Pitching in for the Latina female is Jennifer Lopez who, without being as angry and nasal and in-your-face as Rosie Perez, actually manages to be engaging though this is early in her career, before she decided to punch out and play her (bland) self once she became the trademark known as J. Lo. She all but steals her own pat scenes, especially in one tense exchange she has with Chris Cooper playing a not-so-nice fellow who pushes people onto subway platforms, a reality among New York strap-hangers. But trying to over-analyze this film in terms of shots and composition and visual technicality would be like trying to compare one grain of popcorn to the next: there would be no difference, no relevance in taste, texture, and all that is left to do is munch down. That the action scenes on the subway platforms (for anyone who is actually acquainted with riding the subways in New York City) are as implausible as ever and only convey the type of hyper-masculinized action that makes superheroes of its actors, but who really cares? It's fluff, entertaining, mindless, inane, and that's just what people going to see this type of film expect.",
         "Reading the reviews below this seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of film. Regardless of whether you 'get' the story and the rapport between Harrelson and Snipes, you can't overlook that this is a well made film. I've only seen it twice, once when it first came out on video, and again in the past week. I didn't think it was that remarkable when it first came out, but when I watched it the second time around, I found it highly entertaining and well executed. Granted, it's not the best film ever but I don't think it's deserving of a lot of the bad reviews given here. As a film it succeeds, and if you've never seen it before, it's worth checking out.",
         "Personally speaking, I don't quite know what to make of this picture. I saw it again on late night cable the other night and I was laughing hysterically throughout. Wesley and Woody play two brothers (!) who work as transit cops. Woody's a gambling junkie with a huge debt on his back while Wesley plays the straight man who's getting a little tired of constantly having to bail his brother out. Desperate, Woody plans to hijack the Money Train that rides along to each station, collecting the night's collections. Folks, believe me when I tell you that it actually gets more ridiculous. Add to the mix a pyromaniac token booth bandit, a pre-lobotomy Jennifer Lopez, Robert Blake in a performance so hammy that you can almost smell the bacon coming from your tv, action sequences that are unabashedly ridiculous and you have yourself... Money Train. My favorite moment comes when Robert Blake, after having been informed of the possibility of civilian casualties if the hijacked Money Train continues to speed ahead on the local line, responds with the now-classic line, \"That's what we live with.\" I was laughing so hard that tears were squirting out of my eyes. This movie is utterly ridiculous yet strangely riveting. Wesley Snipes plays his usual cocky, confident self and it seems to me that he won't accept a role these days unless he gets to kick someone in the face. Woody Harrelson looks like he smoked one too many blunts in this one. I actually prefer his character here over Wesley's and that's not saying much. Jennifer Lopez looks damn good but I can't help but think how stupid she is in real life. I really don't know where else to go with this review other than to recommend watching it. You might like it but not because it's quality stuff but because it'll cheer you up, it's so bad. Actual rating ** out of ***** but on the laugh-o-meter I'll give it a full **** out of *****.",
         "Not really a very good movie. Much of the plot is unbelievable and implausible. However, I do find that I enjoy watching this from time to time. I seem to enjoy just about anything with Wesley Snipes. I believe he is very underrated. His easygoing, but dedicated cop in this works for me. He works hard, is smart, and seems to be someone you can rely on. He cares deeply for the \"brother\" who grew up in his house, but he is frustrated in constantly having to bail him out of trouble. I suppose Woody Harrelson's character is probably the worst thing about this for me. His character is seriously annoying, and it would be hard to believe him surviving as a police officer, with all his personal problems. It's okay to suspend disbelief, but a movie like this should at least have an air of plausibility. Robert Blake's subway manager is quite a bit over-the-top, but provides a real antagonism for the buddy/brother cops, and establishes himself as the real villain for the plot. The plan, and the execution of the robbery, (and Snipes character going along with something like this), REALLY stretches plausibility, but there is an easy camaraderie between the 2 actors, and the action is good. It ain't all that good, but it isn't unwatchable.",
         "This is one of Wesley Snipes best (in my opinion), with great action scenes, an awesome finale and an amazing performance from Wesley Snipes!. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is really cool, plus Wesley Snipes is simply amazing in this!, and Woody Harrelson is fantastic!. Wesley and Woody had fantastic chemistry together, and i was really surprised, by how much i enjoyed the film!, plus Jennifer Lopez surprised me, by giving a very good performance!. Robert Blake is excellent as the dick, i hated him, and i thought, it had some great humor as well!, plus the ending is hilarious. You really get to see Snipe's incredible Martial art abilities, and the fight scenes are awesome!, plus one of my favorite scenes is when Snipes and Lopez have a boxing match, it was quite amusing!. Snipes and Lopez had great chemistry together, and it's very well made as well!, plus i thought Snipe's acting was fantastic!. This is one of Wesley Snipes best (in my opinion), with great action scenes, an awesome finale, and amazing performance from Wesley Snipes!, and i say it's a must see!. The Direction is great!. Joseph Ruben does a great job! here, with excellent camera work, awesome angles,and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is fantastic!. Wesley Snipes is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious had wonderful chemistry with Woody Harrelson, kicked that ass, had loads of charisma, seemed to be enjoying himself, never really took himself seriously, and was just amazing overall! (Snipes Rules!!!!!). Woody Harrelson is fantastic here, he is extremely hilarious had wonderful chemistry with Snipes,like Snipes seemed to be enjoying himself, had a great sense of humor, and once again him and Snipes made a terrific pair! (Woody rules). Jennifer Lopez is stunningly gorgeous!, and does very well with what she had to do, i was quite surprised, she also had great chemistry with Snipes. Robert Blake is great as the prick, i hated his guts, and cheered out loud when he got punched and arrested!. Chris Cooper is extremely creepy in his role, and was quite menacing. Bill Nun is great in his cameo (Nunn Rules!). Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5",
         "The movie doesn't have much of a plot but it's still a pretty entertaining movie. Which features great performances from the cast. It's nice for a Saturday night at the movies. 3(***)out of 4(****)stars",
         "This is certainly an action movie that deserves alot of credit. Instead, everyone brings it down like it's the worst one ever made. If you're interested in seeing a shallow, meaningless action film, rent Tango & Cash. That trash should've never been made. This is way better than that. Money Train has a marvelous cast, applausable action, and sizzling music. 8 out of 10.",
         "Money Train is a great popcorn movie and Snipes and Harrison once again show the chemistry that makes a good buddy movie. The script is fast-paced and clever and Jennifer Lopez is as beautiful and sexy as always. This film is a true \"sleeper hit\" and is well worth the effort to catch-up with if you missed it the first time around.",
         "Action is an interesting film genre. You go in expecting little and are pleasantly surprised if you get more. Films like Face/Off, Die Hard, Speed, Under Siege, while formulaic, were all able to offer the viewer more than they expected going in and so have become beloved classics of the genre. The Money Train tries to be more than a lot of the action films that came out and simply disappeared in the early 90s, but falls a little short. While the film certainly isn't bad, it isn't considered a classic of the genre, and, while not a financial failure, relatively few people saw it and even fewer remember it. The film reunites the stars of White Men Can't Jump, Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as a pair of law enforcement officers John (Snipes) and Charlie (Harrelson) who basically decide to steal from their boss (Robert Blake) who is a real piece of work. John has a hot girlfriend Grace (a pre Selena Jennifer Lopez) and Charlie has a gambling problem. Sound familiar? There are some funny moments and the dramatic scenes between Snipes and Harrelson are excellent. But aside from these, there really aren't any memorable moments. While the pairing of Snipes and Harrelson isn't tired, it doesn't have the same impact it had on their previous outing. Blake is menacing and odious but his character is not a believable or effective villain. Chris Cooper, who has a smaller role in this as Torch, would have been a better antagonist. Money Train is OK and a reasonably entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but it is also a missed opportunity. Snipes, Lopez, Harrelson and Blake try hard, but the finished product is less than the sum of its parts, and that's possibly the most frustrating thing of all.",
         "If you are seeking an exciting, dramatic movie, with everything, including the kitchen sink thrown in, you've found it. This story revolves around a special transit vehicle called the \" Money Train. \" The armored subway car itself belong to the New York Transit authority and is overseen by Police Chief Donald Paterson (Robert Blake). Although there are many policemen assigned to the Train units, or subway, only two are causing Paterson to become annoyed with their behavior. Officer John and his partner Charlie (Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson) are two disgruntled police officers who have discovered their chief cares more about his train and its on-time schedule, than for the public safety. With their careers all but finished, the two cops plan to rob the train. Both have reasons, but is further complicated when the two half-brothers began squabbling over their beautiful new partner Officer Grace Santiago (Jennifer Lopez). While the two brothers bicker and complain, serious problems like, muggings, pick-pockets and a pyromaniac called 'The Torch\" (Chris Cooper) is causing major concerns. The movie is dosed liberally with fists fights, speed chases and explosions of the third kind, enough to called this movie dramatically exciting. Woody Harrelson gives a special tour De force but is equally confronted by Robert Blake's movie presence. This film is guaranteed to produce excitement and an adrenaline rush as audiences are subjected to the glorious trills of a run-away-train. Excellent viewing. ****"
