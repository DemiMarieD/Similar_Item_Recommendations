         "I have been obsessed with this movie for quite some time. It's setting in Venice Beach and the Santa Monica Pier in the early 1960's, captures an eerie, desolate, seediness that is disappearing faster than mold in the sunlight as our urban landscape becomes more homogeneous and bland. I love so many details of this movie such as the jazz combo in the Blue Grotto, the name \"Blue Grotto\", the carousel, the apartment over the carousel looking out over the water, the tacky carnival atmosphere, the beatnik bongo players on the beach, the mysterious incredible Cameron as the sea witch in flowing black veils, the strange, haunting score, Captian Murdock's home filled with oddities from his travels, the gloomy lighting and crumbling buildings with beautiful baroque detailing and a low, howling wind whistling though the canals. It all melds together in to a gem of a movie that I never get tired of watching. As for the acting, I found Dennis Hopper to be quite convincing and appealing as a nice lonely boy, so refreshingly different from his later roles. The result is a movie that is mysterious, haunting and beautiful which captures the sublime essence of a magical dream falling into decay.",
         "Nearly every review of this film calls it a \"mood piece\", and thats certainly accurate. Those expecting a quickly-paced drive-in horror film will be disappointed. However, those who enjoy atmosphere and character driven fantasy-horror films, such as \"Carnival of Souls\", will probably appreciate this. Curtis Harrington seemed to be at his best when making this, judging from \"Queen of Blood\" and this. It could've used a few more horror elements, but overall this was a memorable little film. It was slowly paced yet never dull and ultimately an effective portrayal of loneliness. Dennis Hopper, turning in probably the most restrained performance of his career, does a good job in his first starring role. Those familiar only with his hippie period (\"Easy Rider\") and the comeback usually playing over-the-top villains (\"Blue Velvet\", \"River's Edge\"), will be surprised at how atypical his parts used to be. Its far from a perfect performance (hes a bit too low-key at times), but gives a lot of emotion for his character. The same can be said for Linda Lawson, playing a mysterious, yet like Hopper ultimately sympathetic character. What makes this more impressive for me than your normal slash-and-dice effort (and will probably disappoint fans of such) is there's no actual monsters or villains. However, fans of moody and atmospheric fantasy-horror films such as the works of Val Lewton will find much to enjoy. I'm looking forward to a second viewing. The only major flaw in the film is the rather deus-ex-machina conclusion, but even that can be overlooked in retrospect. (7/10)",
         "This film excels both as a good narrative (though it borrows heavily from \"Cat People\"), but also on a deeper, symbolic level. While Dennis Hopper had small roles before this, \"Night Tide\" casts him as a lead, and he fares well. Reviewer Rick McGrath says, \"Hopper's acting in Night Tide is, I think, ultimately suspect. It's fun to see him so young, so cute in his tight navy suit, but he plays Johnny Drake as a bumbling, nervous, fidgety, slightly stupid loner ... so much so he often seems dislocated from the action and his co-stars.\" I don't know that I agree. Surely he comes across as nervous and shy at times, but bumbling? Clearly his character was designed to be young and inexperienced -- this is necessary for the scene in which he confronts Captain Murdock (Gavin Muir) in his home and is told tales of the Sirens and is shown a dismembered Arab hand. A hardened sailor wouldn't be so spongelike for forbidden knowledge. McGrath refers to this film as \"a psychosexual tale of freudian camp and hilarity\". I think it's deeper than that. Yes, there's more sexuality than is presented on screen, but I don't accept the absurd premises of McGrath, who goes so far as to say one scene involving a dock is \"phallic\". No way. Is the film campy and hilarious? To a point, sure. It's the early 1960s and the budget is low. But the writer and director, Curtis Harrington, seems to have a vision and executes it with finesse. The opening scene clues us in that Harrington is a man who cares about visuals, and we are reminded of this again alter on when we see Mora close up in the sideshow mermaid tank. He frames shots to reveal not just an object, but an emotion. The casual viewer may overlook the literary and occult themes present in this short film, but I think the flower that is \"Night Tide\" cannot fully bloom without this understanding. As revealed in the closing credits, the film takes its name from a verse in Edgar Allan Poe's \"Annabel Lee\": \"And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling - my darling - my life and my bride, In the sepulchre there by the sea, In her tomb by the sounding sea.\" The poem highlight's Poe's love of a woman so strong it stretches beyond death, and also happens to be the last complete poem he ever wrote, in essence his \"last words\". The macabre nature of the poem underscores the hidden darkness of \"Night Tide\" that may not be apparent to all viewers. Captain Murdock is a man with a rich sense of literature and philology. He is clearly familiar with Greek legends, as he relates the tale of the Sirens briefly to Drake. Presumably he is also the one who named Mora after finding her on a Greek island (assuming her origin is truthful). The name \"Mora\" is likely a variation of the Greek name \"Moira\", one of the Fates of legend. Her name translates roughly to \"fate\", \"destiny\" or \"doom\", a fitting moniker for a woman who is the death of her lovers. Murdock also paraphrases a notable line from Shakespeare's Hamlet: \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\" As an aside, it is worth noting that Harrington named his main character \"Drake\", a male duck, which may be symbolic of Johnny's being torn between land and sea, as ducks are comfortable equally with both. This is clear from his career as a Navy man who spends his time on the ocean, but seems more at home on the shore. And, of course, it parallels his love of Mora, the creature of the sea, with the relative safety of the land where she is unable to lure him to a watery grave. Most viewers will miss the occult connection, as it is not made overtly clear in the film. The only sign we have to go off of is Murdock's address in Venice, 777 Saabek Lane. \"777\" may be familiar to Biblical scholars as one of the numbers of perfection -- 7, the number of God himself, combined with 3, the unity of the trinity. It is alluded by this address that Murdock is a man of knowledge and power, both mysterious and esoteric. But also, this is a number associated with Aleister Crowley, the famed English occultist. This is no mere coincidence, as Crowley has a connection to this film. His connection comes through the woman who plays the \"water witch\" that speaks the odd language, Marjorie Elizabeth Cameron (1922-1995). Cameron was the wife of rocket scientist Jack Parsons, a friend of Alesiter Crowley who was hand-chosen to lead California's Agape Lodge in 1942. Parsons, incidentally, was also a magick partner with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Cameron came to be involved with \"Night Tide\" as she had partied with co-star Dennis Hopper in the 1950s, and worked with Curtis Harrington and Kenneth Anger in 1954's \"Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome\" -- Anger was another Crowley devotee, who also knew Manson Family member Bobby Beausoleil. He later associated with Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey. To say that Cameron, Hopper and Harrington had connections to Crowley and the occult would be a mere truism, and that occult symbolism figures into \"Night Tide\" should not be considered a stretch. (Review considered too long by IMDb... see Killer Reviews for complete write-up.)",
         "Sailor on shore-leave meets and falls for a mysterious woman who works as a carnival mermaid on the California coast. Is she a neurotic or actually a descendant of the Sirens? Moody mystery isn't quite the thriller it was advertised as. It has a straightforward narrative and very few actual surprises, but there are surreal bits, a great beatnik party on the beach, terrific black-and-white cinematography, and handsome, pre-hippie Dennis Hopper at his most grounded and friendly (and polite!). The film hopes to absorb its audience by means of atmosphere and little red herrings, not big shocks. I admired the film, but it's not to every taste. **1/2 from ****",
         "Fascinating study with great location and innocent performance by Dennis Hopper who looks about sixteen years old, but is actually in his late 20's. Linda Lawson is lovely and mysterious and it's always great to see Luanna Anders. I hope this film has some kind of cult following because it's so strange. A 7 out of 10. Best performance = Dennis Hopper. This is on DVD now and fairly easy to find. If you're a Hopper fan, this is a must-see. Great black and white cinematography and eery feel the entire film that is unexplainable. This should definitely have a higher rating by IMDb voters (in my opinion).",
         "Released one year prior to the atmospheric, surreal horror classic \"Carnival of Souls,\" \"Night Tide\" is a similarly bizarre film that radiates an odd effect. Johnny (a young Dennis Hopper) falls in love with Mora (Linda Lawson), a sideshow performer who might also be a mermaid with a penchant for murdering her lovers. The performances are adequate and realistic, with Hopper conveying a proper balance of lovestruck awe and confusion; Lawson is fittingly remote and enigmatic. Writer-director Curtis Harrington builds a fair amount of suspense and limits the action to several effective dream sequences, thereby retaining a surreal mood. Not as wild as Jack Hill's \"Spider Baby,\" nor as subtly brilliant as \"Carnival of Souls,\" \"Night Tide\" is a diverting in-between that's worth a look.",
         "Though it is a small production, it is interesting in the way it deals with the myth and mystery of the sea and its lore. We are purposely given sketchy information about the carnival mermaid who may in fact be a siren luring the lonely sailor nearly to his doom. A very young Hopper plays the sailor, and Lawson is sufficiently enchanting to make us believe that she is more than just a girl wearing a fake fishtail. The film has a TWILIGHT ZONE quality to it, leaving the viewer wondering at the end.",
         "Odd, cowpelling little film, very mooch in the vein of moovies like \"Carnival of Souls\", about a lonely, fresh-faced sailor(Dennis Hopper) who falls madly in love with a mysterious, siren-like woman(Linda Lawson) who may be a mermaid - and a monster. Pre-psycho Hopper(\"Blue Velvet\", \"Easy Rider\", \"Apocalypse Now\")actually plays a straight, all-American nice guy (for a change!), who happens to fall for the wrong beautiful girl. Lawson(\"Lets Kill Uncle\", \"Apache Rifles\") makes for one sexy sea nymph, although she does dance like Elaine Bettis with rickets. Rounding out the cast nicely is the always-snuggly Luana Anders(\"Dementia 13\", \"Reform School Girls('57)\", \"Easy Rider\") as the sweetie next-door who has the hots for Hopper's peach-faced sailor. Shot on a low budget, to be sure, but capably acted & directed, with a pretty neat story. Editing problems abound, and the climax is a little hokey, but the MooCow says this is one forgotten flick that should be dug up from the rubbish pile of stinky 60's monster flicks. \"Night Tide\" was written and directed by Curtis Harrington, whose stinky directing resume includes such bombs as \"Killer Bees\", \"Voyage to the Pre-Historic Planet\", and \"Devil Dog: Hound of Hell\", as well as stinky 80's tv series \"Dynasty\" and \"The Colbys\". \"Night Tide\" is one of those few moovies that you actually want to thank American International Pictures for making, since they would have been the ONLY production company to touch a film like this. The MooCow says dive right into \"Night Tide\" - the water is fine!! ;=8)",
         "I first saw this movie many years ago and had happy memories of its moody seaside-carnival atmosphere, of Dennis Hopper's likably open youthful performance, and of Linda Lawson's enchanting mermaid, Mora -- all aspects much commented upon here at IMDb. I recently picked up a cheapie DVD version (its cover actually manages to misspell Lawson's name twice as \"Larson\") from a bin at a dollar store down at appropriately seedy Rockaway Beach; and though I can see why I fell in love with the sexy dark-haired Lawson, a real beauty, and still admire the film's haunting atmosphere and its excellent black-and-white photography, it is a bit more talky and slow-moving than I'd recalled, and owes a bit more to Val Lewton's \"Cat People\" than I'd first realized. (Perhaps I'd have been more patient with it if I'd been seeing it for the first time.) I'd also believed, all these years, that the story ended on a distinctly supernatural note, or at least one of ambiguity. The conclusion does retain, in truth, a hint of the supernatural, but it's outweighed by a long psychological explanation -- long and, for the Mora character, genuinely tragic -- which I'd conveniently blotted out of my memory. Still, Lawson does remain one seductive mermaid, and the sadness of her story -- of what is essentially her victimization -- makes her character all the more touching.",
         "Oddball cheapie is a lot of atmospheric fun for about an hour or so, then kind of just peters out with a weak ending. Still, there is a nice tone to the off hand, low key acting, and it is wonderful for an L.A. Lover to see Santa Monica and Venice as they looked in this period. This film, along with Welles \"Touch Of Evil\" and John Parker's \"Dementia\" aka \"Daughter of Horror\", form a sort of dark trilogy of Venice Beach Noir. The unmistakable Bruno Ve Sota (the poor man's Orson Welles?) is in two of them. Anyway, it's a must for any fan of the \"Pyschotronic\" film underground, you'll be glad you checked it out. Love the scene with the Seagull."
