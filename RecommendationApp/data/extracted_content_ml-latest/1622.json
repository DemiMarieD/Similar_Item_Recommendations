      "reviews": [
         "Matthew Harrison and Kevin Corrigan have come up a quirky movie in which there are a lot of ideas. Some of them come across and others fail, but the film is worth a look because it has good performances. The first half of the movie has excellent pacing, as it moves quickly with all that's going on. Michael Rapaport makes an excellent appearance as Stretch. This is an actor that always delivers. He is always effective in whatever he plays. Kevin Corrigan's Redmond shows enough confusion as he moves through the different situations. It's not his best role, but having an interest in the film, since he co-wrote the screen play, might have had a toll on him. Linda Fiorentino, Lily Taylor, James Woods and Burt Young make great contributions in an assortment of New York characters. One of the funniest scenes is at the beginning of the movie when Uncle Sam steals the car and tries to get rid of the dog he finds inside. The shooting scenes are amazing because no one is shot, even at close range. Don't ever show this film to Quentin Tarantino, as he will probably have a panic attack!",
         "Man, I hate to say anything good about a film with James Woods in the credits, my personal choice as Hollywood's most irritating and unlikable actor since Victor Mature. However, he's only got a bit part, thank god, and he plays a consumate loser(not much of a stretch) so I will gleefully throw this one a prop. I don't know where all these lousy votes are coming from. I guess people tuned out early from all the existential angst our main character, Kevin Corrigan, is bleeding all over the place. Michael Rapaport is hysterical as an enthusiastic Irish gun toting beer distributor at war with more ethnic gun toting beer distributors. Basically the same role he played in True Romance but this time he's on crack. I think I counted about 700 beers in his refrigerator? I also noticed that nobody in this movie can shoot worth a s#@t. Spoilers ahead: Have you ever seen anybody empty an entire clip from a Desert Eagle at 3 feet and hit nothing but the sky? This movie is inventive, witty, and just downright hilarious. Worth a second look. The final scene had me simultaneously rolling on the floor and searching for an airsick bag. Funny funny funny! A solid 9 beer salute.",
         "Kicked in the Head rocked, it was hilarious and Matthew Harrison was excellent in the movie. He is going to be a big star one day, he's such a great actor. The movie kicked butt, and I would recommend it to anyone.",
         "If you really want to laugh out loud this is your movie. There is no waiting for lunacy to begin. It is a quick moving, never boring parody. Michael Rapaport stole the movie. If his fast talking, high energy performance didn't have you laughing he at least had you smiling. The only disappointment was that there were not more scenes with him in them. There should have been more scenes with that rival business. James Woods in comedy... who knew...so funny. The gun battles are so well done. The enthusiasm of the shooters makes their lack of aim all that more funny. Anytime you see a gun... pay attention... you won't be disappointed. None of the shooters could hit the floor if they fell...too funny.",
         "This is really an underrated film. There is great acting and character development, especially by Michael Rapaport who plays the main character's strange but lucky friend \"Stretch\". The LEAST interesting character is probably actually the main character, Redmond, who seems to just wander through life and let things happen to him. But this is what makes the movie interesting; around Redmond's world revolves many strange and unique people. Coincidence and symbolism play a large part in Redmond's world too, which provides comedy in the most serious situations. A lot of this movie seems taken from Pulp Fiction, from the guy who doesn't get shot to the guys sitting around a table talking about classic movies (as opposed to Madonna songs in pulp). I also found the ending unfulfilling. Otherwise, a strange but interesting movie that I recommend.",
         "The movie is the opposite of this Hollywood action guy who saves the world in one after another 30 second MTV Video cut with intrusively humor. The movie is just about 4 Days of a young man in New York with it's madness and sadness.",
         "I stumbled across this movie on satellite cable last one night. I was mesmerized - it was SO funny, so well written, and so underplayed. This little independent film has a lot going for it. Michael Rappaport has one of his best roles, James Woods plays a weasel like only he can... this movie is \"Pulp Fiction\" meets \"Slacker\" but a lot funnier... Guns, drugs, a lost dog, stolen cars, and LOTS of beer. Check this one out - if you like whimsical \"small\" films then this one is one for you.",
         "i was completely unaware of this movie when it was in theatrical release.i stumbled across it while watching on cable, and was immediately entranced.although it is edgy and modern, it has a similar allure for me as \"a thousand clowns\"(Jason robards,jr).new york city is a principal character(i admit that the locations in lower Manhattan are my old stomping grounds)which will usually add to the appeal of any movie. following REDMOND as he wanders from his lower east side home to bizarre beer distributor wars to incomprehensible black market deals to the haunting allure of an alcoholic flight attendant 'guardian angel' is funny,compelling, and repeatedly watchable. corrigan's efforts in front of and behind the camera are admirable.not to be missed is James woods' UNCLE SAM. he's a crazy incorrigible hustler who adds a wistful element to a lowlife character.",
         "First off for anyone who is a Kevin Korrigan Fan should know that Kevin co-wrote this movie with Matthew Harrison. They had been friends and he had called on Kevin to ask if kevin liked what he had got for a script about a poor bloke who had all of these mishaps. Kevin and him got the idea to use kevin's own misfortunes as the basis for the plot. Of course they had to fill it in with things that actually were not true to make things fall into place. Second- all-star cast. It won't get any better than Michael Rapaport as 'stretch', Lili taylor as 'happy', James Woods as his 'uncle sam' and Linda Florintino as the unlucky 'angel'. Just listening to Rapaport is a blast. He's the master of overlapping dialog and using his thick accent to give any scene a gritty urban feel. If you really think about it all of the characters have a very gritty urban sense to them. It's like you just know that these characters (must) actually exist in like N.Y or N.J or someplace (the only word that I can think of that really works here, that I'm really over using is)GRITTY, like thick in culture, or blue collar, backstreet, tough neighborhoods. I LOVE THAT!!!! Fast talking, overlapping dialog is the best. Another great movie with Kevin Korrigan is 'Walking in Talking' It also has another star who is amazingly humorous...Catherine Keener. If you want to see another awesome movie with Michael Rapaport at his (almost best, second to 'kicked in the head) performance, check out 'beautiful Girls'. They are the best, you should check them out! Enjoy.",
         "The dialog in the movie is clever, with amusing use of fast talking and repetition. Some of the \"philosophical\" speeches were good too, particularly one where the main character (Redmond) was warned about stewardesses' body rhythms. The violent scenes seemed to be parodies of action movies; lots of shots fired without hitting anyone. There were a few visually amusing images worked in too. The plot was mostly aimless. Redmond had no job or apartment, but a girl was interested in him anyway. He had few goals other than working on his book and getting noticed by a flight attendant who interested him. Along the way, Sam got him mixed up with some criminals. Redmond's uncle, Sam, observed that Redmond was in a self-destructive period in his life. So while the plot was pretty weak, the dialog was pretty funny."
