         "Jon Peters' first production as he transformed himself (with girlfriend Barbra Streisand's help) from hairdresser to movie producer, the movie is a gem of Seventies style at it's finest. The clothes, the hair, makeup, music, attitude, interiors and locations ride the crest of the high-style wave that flooded the world through the Eighties. Combining the improbable worlds of violence and fashion, with a story that centers on a famous photographer (Dunaway) and her ability to *see* her friends and colleagues being stalked and murdered, *Eyes* has moments of serious suspense, but that's hardly the reason to see this movie. Utilizing the actual photography of fashion god Helmut Newton, the film maker has exquisitely captured the 1978 New York fashion and disco scene in a way that none of the recent looks at the Seventies has been able to, but then, again, this movie was *made* in 1978, not 27 years later. The scenes of photo shoots are particularly fun to watch, with one scene portraying a burning car crash in Columbus Circle in which the models, clad in garter belts and fur coats cat-fight before the camera. The ingenuous use of *real* models add the precise amount of vacuity necessary to make the surreal shot work. Another photo shoot involves a model dead from a gunshot to his heart lying in a pool surrounded by exotically dressed disco-dancing models and a throbbing disco beat. The plot is secondary to style in this movie, and style is the only reason this movie should be remembered. Favorite moment: Darlanne Fluegel as the model Lulu haplessly trying to explain to the press *why* violence is important in fashion photos.",
         "This movie was around for twenty years before I saw it. I recall it as not having the best of reputations. But I found it to be suspenseful and it could be considered a forerunner of today's erotic thrillers. Faye Dunaway is Laura Mars, a fashion/glamour photographer whose work is controversial in that some say it glorifies both sex and violence towards women. (Sounds like a pretty contemporary theme, doesn't it?) She becomes troubled by frightening visions she has of killers-eye views of murders. When a killing she has just \"seen\" turns out to have actually happened nearby she tells the police. She then finds out that a detective (Tommy Lee Jones) has already been investigating some cases where murder scenes closely resembled her photos. Dunaway is always consistent in delivering good performances and this one is no exception. It was refreshing not to see Jones in his \"Mr. Intensity\" character he's played so often since 'The Fugitive.' Although some will doubtless find flaws to point up here and there, I found the film to be very enjoyable. Brad Dourif, Rene Aberjonois and Raul Julia also star. Irvin Kershner's direction is stylish and John Carpenter is responsible for the story and co-wrote the script.",
         "This 1978 chiller directed by Irvin Kerschner (RoboCop 2) and based on a story by John Carpenter, has Faye Dunaway as a fashion photographer who suddenly discovers that she has the ability to \"see\" through the eyes of a serial killer. All her premonitions of the murders are very accurate, and the victims are all people she knows. Soon it becomes apparent the killer is coming after her. Tommy Lee Jones is great as the police lieutenant/love interest (back when his face wasn't pockmarked with age), and the supporting cast (Raul Julia, Brad Dourif) is excellent. The movie's depictions of the murders were quite shocking for it's day, and it manages to keep us scared and in suspense throughout, though some of the scenes border on grotesque. Direction by Kirschner is tight, music is suitably eery, and the performances are overall impressive. A winner",
         "Eyes of Laura Mars -- Horror/Thriller -- 1978 This is an old supernatural thriller of sorts from way back in the 70s'. It revolves around a female fashion/glamour photographer who lives to make crude photographic nudie art that sepcializes in scenes of violence. Some people find her \"art\" to be rather disturbing and horribly offensive. So someone decides to go around killing her friends and acquaintances. To make matters worse, Laura Mars can see the murders happening--through her own eyes! Here's the breakdown: The Good: --Clever story, and fairly original. Adds a nice twist to the usual cops-hunting-murderer story. --Good acting all around. Brad Dourif is creepy, Tommy Lee Jones is cool, Raul Julia is... kinda weird... --Good atmosphere and cinematography all around, with some strong direction. The tense moments are generally pretty well done. --Some nice, genuine, surprises throughout the film. It does manage to successfully keep you guessing just who the killer is. Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help: --Contains a decent amount of fairly well-known actors including Faye Dunaway, Tommy Lee Jones, Brad Dourif (better known as Chucky from the Child's Play series), Raul Julia, and Rene Auberjonois (famous for his Star Trek: Deep Space Nine role). It was also co-written by John \"Halloween\" Carpenter. --Quite a bit of nudity. She is taking pictures of naked \"victims of violence\" after all. --Somewhat grotesque 70's music permeates here and there. --Some decent character development and depth. The Bad: --Not quite as scary or riveting as I'm sure it was back in '78. This review being written in 2006. --Some \"logic\" problems every now and then. For instance, when Laura Mars sees someone being murdered, that's all she sees--yet there are times when she seems to be able to move around, once even driving a car, with more competence than one would expect from someone who just instantly \"went blind.\" --Occasional dips in the quality of the atmosphere and writing. The Ugly: --The make-up used on the models in the 70's. Holy crap! Memorable Scene: --Nice climax to the film. Fun Fact: --The photographic art in the film is actually from professional \"glamour\" photographer Helmut Newton. Acting: 8/10 , Story: 8/10 , Atmosphere: 7/10 , Cinematography: 8/10 , Character Development: 7/10 , Special Effects/Make-up: 7/10 , Dialog: 7/10 , Music: 6/10 , Direction: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 5/10 , Violence: 6/10 , Gore: 3/10 Cheesiness: 2/10 , Crappiness: 0/10 Overall: 7/10 Finally, I would recommend this to hardcore horror/thriller fans or film buffs. John Carpenter or Tommy Lee Jones fans will likely enjoy it. The movie is not without its problems, small though they are, but may not be enjoyed all that well by many modern viewers. www.ResidentHazard.com http://bartboard.proboards3.com/index.cgi (Movie themed message board)",
         "A surprisingly forgotten gem of a psychological thriller, Eyes of Laura Mars is a unique and sophisticated shocker that stands out from the normal variety of thrillers. NYC fashion photographer is having visions where she sees through the eyes of the murderer that's targeting the people around her. But what will she do when she sees said murderer coming after her? Eyes of Laura Mars was originally based upon a screenplay by master horror director John Carpenter, which isn't surprising considering just how imaginative and effectively frightening that this film comes off. Yet, Eyes' isn't just a terror film, it's also a film of intriguing mystery, sweeping romance, and well-rounded characters. All of this adds up to an enveloping story that's directed with flair and style by Irvin Kershner. The murder sequences pack plenty of tension, yet they aren't gory. The NYC filming locations are fantastic and allow for some truly breath taking cinematography. While the 70's fashions do date the film, they don't subtract from its over all impact. The soundtrack is composed of some great disco numbers, and the theme song by Barbara Streisand is stunningly good. The cast is perhaps the best highlight of the film though. Star Faye Dunaway is excellent as always as our understandably disturbed heroine. Tommy Lee Jones is equally excellent as the police detective who falls in love with Dunaway. Rene Auberjonois is plucky as Dunaway's agent. Brad Dourif is good as the shifty-eyed driver, as is Raul Julia as Dunaway's wretched ex-husband. Eyes of Laura Mars is on a level above the average terror film. It's not only thrilling, but strong enough to be emotionally devastating as well. Well worth finding for thriller and horror fans alike. *** 1/2 out of ****",
         "Sure.... Compared to the thrillers of today - it just can't compare. It seems low budget and 3rd world in quality. But it's got so much more beneath the surface. The plot is simple - a 'High Fashion' photographer (Laura Mars) begins to have visions of brutal murders - both when sleeping and while awake. Some of these visions begin to seep into her work and her images. But soon, the visions begin to include many of her friends, acquaintances and co-workers. A homicide detective (John Neville) assigned to the case begins hanging around and trying to solve the case, including the murders involving Laura's friends. Many of Laura's friends & acquaintances get killed along the way, leaving her emotionally bereft and open to Neville's advances. I won't blow the end of the film (as others may) by giving away the twists and turns. There are a few decent performances in the movie - including Rene Auberjunois as Laura's 'flamboyantly flaming' manager, assistant and best friend. And, how he can wear a dress.... This stylish & sometimes sexy thriller is an 8 of 10 when the age of the flick comes into consideration. Decent plot, decent acting and decent twists. And, I am sorry, but Barbara Streisand's opening song still stands as one of my all time favorite songs.... Speaking of the opening, the opening credits of the film are kinda creepy and chilling. Go rent it and decide for yourself!",
         "Laura Mars is a very successful fashion photographer who one day starts to get visions of brutal murders being carried out. Troubled and in fear for her sanity, Laura turns to the police for help. But this only adds to her problems as Detective Neville points out to her that the murder scenes bare similarities to some of her staged photographs. The pair of them must figure it out quickly because the murderer is closing in on Laura and those close to her. In 1978, John Carpenter thrilled horror fans with his baby sitting terror piece, Halloween. Also released was this mystery/thriller/horror film, written by Carpenter and directed by Irvin Kershner {The Empire Strikes Back} which is a film that has been called anything from innovative to outright rubbish. The truth is that where Halloween is a horror film of no character substance, Eyes Of Laura Mars is a completely different animal. It's bright blending of 70s fashion photography with Carpenter's dastardly tale {tho the final draft was tampered by many}, is a success. This is a psychological thriller first and foremost, yes horror elements are there {it's a done deal with a serial killer on the loose}, but running alongside a clever romantic angle, the film gains an intensity that few other 70s psychological thrillers can boast. The cast, other than an insipidly hammy Raul Julia, also come out rather well. Faye Dunaway {Mars}, Tommy Lee Jones {Neville}, Brad Dourif {horror staple that he is} and Rene Auberjonois give credit to well formed characters. Technically it's a fine picture as well, Irvin Kershner and his cinematographer Victor J. Kemper excellently utilise the New York City location. Especially during the fashion shoot sequences, where the 70s and its glamour is fully realised. \"Innovated\" blurred corridor shots to portray Laura's terrible visions are creepy and highly effective, while i would be surprised if anyone doubted the impact of a mirror shot in the glorious finale. Thought by many to have not aged well, Eyes Of Laura Mars is often consigned to the cupboard marked \"dated\", that's unfair because good thrillers are good thrillers, regardless of age. Emotionally strong and pulsing with imminent terror, this is a badly undervalued, and forgotten picture. 8/10",
         "I saw Eyes of Laura Mars a few years ago and just watched it again very recently. I remembered it as being fantastic but upon watching it again I was a little disappointed. It's a solid film, by no means bad, it's just nothing all that special. For the past 3 years or so I've been totally hooked on giallo's and this film plays in a lot of ways like an homage to those Italian thrillers. Touches here and there remind you of Dario Argento (obsessive mirror imagery, Laura's visions etc.), Lucio Fulci, Sergio Martino and Mario Bava, such as the model settings and murder scenarios. While this film scores heavy on style (and music, though I find this soundtrack a bit hokey, but generally OK) it just lacks the magic that the best giallo's seem to have. The plot, while intriguing enough, is not nearly played out to it's full potential. There are gripping scenes here to be sure, but the film drags quite a bit and nothing virtually happens for a long period of time. For seasoned giallo fans, we know the killer is most definitely gonna be the most unlikely one, and for a lack of suspects, I didn't find it hard to figure out who was guilty, but there's pretty much no logic to support it (but that's a giallo trademark, a pro rather than a con actually). For me, the problem is that this film doesn't have the same trashy feel and atmosphere as the best Italian thrillers it seems to be imitating. In a lot of ways I like this film, certain scenes are truly gripping but there's simply something lacking. Being a huge fan of John Carpenter, I can't help but think what he could have done had he directed this. He came up with the story and shares the credits as the writer of the screenplay and what's more, he loves the Italian giallo films as well. His own homage to the genre; Someone's Watching Me, the little known TV film was terrific and you could see that he definitely had the feel for the genre and could easily translate it to American settings. I don't feel that Kershner, as good a director as he is, has the same love for the genre as Carpenter. I recommend watching it, it scores on a number of levels.",
         "I understand that this was filmed and set in the 70s in New York and I think it's meant to mirror some of the avant garde style of that time and locale, but I couldn't stand Faye's acting style in this film. Her character is supposed to be a strong, successful, visionary/controversial photographer. She seemed to start many scenes playing just that, but would then quickly fall to pieces and appear to not know where she was, what she was doing, or how to answer a simple question. This happens over and over. I felt like I was watching over- acting from the 40s. The rest of the cast saved it for me. Especially Brad Dourif and Tommy Lee Jones. I liked the general story and premise, but even at only 104 minutes, it felt drawn-out. A lot of people seem to think the ending was predictable. It caught me pleasantly by surprise! I doubt as many people will be as put off as I was by Faye's acting in this particular film, so I would recommend this with my own reservations. I love supernatural movies and whodunits, and this was an interesting combination of both. It is definitely dated, though. Good luck.",
         "In this violent, sado-masochistic thriller, then recent Oscar Winner Faye Dunaway (\"Network\") began her descent into decline with a role that, in spite of its juiciness, is defeated by a rather absurd premise and an even more ridiculous conclusion. Faye does an outstanding job as the Mahogany of photography who can see murders in her mind's eye as they happen, but is helpless to stop them. She plays a totally sympathetic character practically unlike any role she played during this era (\"Voyage of the Damned\" being possibly the only other role), extremely as far away from her neurotic character in \"Chinatown\" and the power-hungry executive in \"Network\". She is as far from her infamous role of \"Mommie Dearest\" as she can get, although she reminds me a lot of Miss Joan Crawford in a 1952 thriller called \"Sudden Fear\". Top billed leading male Tommy Lee Jones plays a cop who decides to protect her and eventually falls in love with her. The supporting cast is filled with interesting performances, particularly Rene Auberjonois as a stereotypical gay assistant, obviously modeled on Clifton Webb in \"Laura\". Raul Julia and Brad Dourif add some creepy performances as well. Stage and soap actress Meg Mundy has a nice brief role as one of the victims. Views of New York City in the late '70s are quite well filmed, and you won't soon forget the shot of Columbus Circle with two women clad only in their scanties and mink coats going at it after a faked car accident while Dunaway snaps away. Add on a spicy Barbra Streisand song (\"Prisoner\") as well as some disco hits of the day. But a lack of cohesion and the final revelation both dates and destroys the credibility that earlier parts of the film had developed earlier. Try not to compare this to some of Hitchcock's later films and sexual thrillers of the 1980's and 90's like \"Fatal Attraction\", \"Sea of Love\", and especially \"Basic Instinct\"."

Although suspicious of her, he soon realizes that she hasn't been involved in any of the crimes but can see what is happening through the eyes of the killer. After her friends and some of her models are killed, she joins forces with Neville to identify the killer before she too becomes a victim.",
         "New York photographer Laura Mars' latest exhibit, its associated book titled \"Eyes of Mars\", and her continuing current work are considered controversial for the depiction of female sexuality side by side with violence. Laura has been having the occasional vision for several years, which started this thematic work. These visions started as fleeting thoughts, which have now become full blown moving pictures, as if she were looking through a camera lens. These visions begin to haunt her as she can see people she knows in these visions, they who end up being murdered by a knife through the eyes, the actual murder which she \"sees\" as it is happening through the eyes of the killer. As the police investigate these murders, she tries to explain to them her visions. The only one of the investigating detectives who believes her is the lead, Lieutenant John Neville. Laura is scared not only for her friends and associates, but also herself as she can see in her visions that the killer is also after her. As she begins a personal relationship with Neville, she comes to the conclusion that the killer may not be some random nut who solely dislikes her work, but someone that she knows and trusts, the leading candidates being her estranged ex-husband, Michael Reisler, who recently reentered her life, and her driver, Tommy Ludlow, who routinely carries a knife and whose criminal past she had only recently learned."
