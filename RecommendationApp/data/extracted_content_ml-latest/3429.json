         "If there's any single short out there that marked a real defining point for those claymation whiz kids down at Aardman, I'd say 'Creature Comforts' is the one. The debut piece of the now legendary Nick Park (who'd go on to create a series of captivating short films featuring a certain cheese-loving inventor and his well-read canine cohort, whose names I'm sure you don't need me to spell out for you here), it's now a widely-regarded classic in stop motion animation history, and there are some pretty good reasons for that. No other Aardman project, great as they frequently are, has managed to combine such high levels of whimsy, charm and poignancy quite as deftly as this one. The bright idea of taking real-life recordings with members of the public and aligning them with talking plasticine animals in the style of vox pop interviews (in this case, zoo animals commenting on their general living conditions, as extracted from discussions with residents of retirement homes, council housing and student halls) was so fresh, so ingenious and so delightful that the five minute running time designated here simply wasn't enough. It was a concept which begged to be extended, and it spawned a much-deserved franchise in the early 90s with TV ads for the UK's Heat Electric and, more recently, a long-awaited TV series in 2003. A franchise which in turn helped to establish Aardman's now-firm reputation for colourful, offbeat cosiness, as opposed to some of the more downbeat and sombre shorts they'd been working on for much of the 80s (many of which were good enough in their own right - Peter Lord's 'Going Equipped', which debuted alongside 'Creature Comforts' in the Channel 4 series 'Lip Synch, in particular is more than worth a look). Compared to a lot of the output that followed it, the animation here may look a little primitive by today's standards (the depressed gorilla, for example, is quite clearly riddled with the animator's finger prints), but it's an easily forgivable fault, and doesn't detract from the visual joy that this short is swimming in from start to finish. Get a load of all those wonderful sight gags - the elderly bush-baby's gigantic magnified pupils, the unidentified birds with beaks held on by elastic bands (the antics of the non-speaking characters hovering about in the background have always been something to keep an eye out for in the 'Creature Comforts' realm), the treadmill-running terrapins, the dozens of shrieking, flailing baby rodents\u0085all of it gold. Earning Nick Park an Oscar in 1990 for his efforts, it's endearing and comical to the bone - and yet there's also a mild tinge of sadness to it that I doubt 'Creature Comforts' would have been nearly as memorable without. For all the quirky cuteness that those clay-built critters possess, the anguish of a few of the original speakers remains persistent in their voices, and shines through in their pertaining characters quite dynamically. Most of the animals, it would seem, are perfectly contented with their lives in captivity, but there are a few who feel the sting of alienation, the homesick wild cat from Brazil being the standout personality on this one - the high range of exaggerated mannerisms that Park uses to bring him to life are unforgettable. A lovely film and a wonderful concept, what makes 'Creature Comforts' such a striking experience is, in part, how it touches upon some of the helplessness and frustrations of having to live in a world you feel out of place in. It's also a whole lot of fun too. Grade: A",
         "Before the \"Wallace & Gromit\" series and \"Chicken Run\", Nick Park made a splendid debut with \"Creature Comforts\", in which several animals in a zoo explain how unhappy they are to be in cages. If the cartoon is goofy, then they play it to good effect, and it has a good message. I've always thought that Nick Park not only has great ideas for cartoons, but that his claymation style is quite neat, with the bug eyes and rectangular mouths. Other interesting cartoons of this style include not only the \"Wallace & Gromit\" series, but also \"Wat's Pig\" and \"Ident\". The last two are fascinating, if bizarre.",
         "An interviewer goes to a zoo in order to interview the animals there. Her subjects include polar bears, big cats, an ape, a turtle and others. The subjects of conversation include the weather, their living conditions and what they like to eat. One of the very first projects from Nick Park and it is still very funny now. The animation looks a little dated but the idea is the same so it's not too bad. My understanding is that real people were interviewed for the voices and the animals were matched up to them \u0096 i.e. these aren't scripts. The end result is hilarious \u0096 the animals are matched to their accents and their subject matter really well. By themselves the words would be dull for the majority, while the animation would be merely cute. Together the film is very funny. Some of it is wise and slightly touching but really it's just funny to hear animals talk about their conditions as if they were humans! This was used for adverts in the UK to great effect and it is responsible for starting Nick park's path to Wallace and Gromit and Oscar fame. Overall a simple idea is turned into a wonderfully bright little short that is worth seeing for anyone who has seen Wallace & Gromit.",
         "This short won the Oscar for Animated Short, beating another Aardman Studios short, A Grand Day Out. The concept behind its creation is an old one, used by John and Faith Hubley: record conversation and come up with fitting animation. In this case, someone went around interviewing residents of a housing development and the answers were transformed into the answers given to an interviewer by animals in a zoo. Everything here is excellent: animation, dialogue are wonderful. Most definitely worth getting. In print on more than one source: a compilation titled Creature Comforts and on The World's Greatest Animation. Highly recommended.",
         "this is a short claymation movie from the makers of \"wallace and Gromit\" shorts and the full length major motion picture \"chicken run.\" To the uninformed, this is a collection of brief interviews with zoo animals about their daily habits, and religion, feed habits, etc. but, what is really going on here is even better. The makers of this movie went to nursing homes and recorded interviews with the residents, Then animated animals for the voices. So, really when you watch this you are listening to the views of elderly people as animals. I personally find this to be a very interesting idea. 10 all the way",
         "This is the old version of the soon-to-be TV series of Nick Park's Aardman Animations. Basically they record voices from real interviews talking about a certain subject, for example they mention about food and where they are living. When they have recorded these voices they use their genius to match this talking with a suitable character. All the characters are wild and zoo animals talking. There is a lion, tortoises, polar bears, a panda bear, a female gorilla, a hippo (with one behind her pooping) and many other animals made of the genius Plastercine. There is now quite a good TV series of this one-off show of interview made animation. The quality of this animation is obviously the fact that everything moving is made of Plastercine, it deserved the Oscar! As part of Aardman Animations, it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!",
         "'Creature Comforts' is a nice early work from the creator of the 'Wallace & Gromit'-shorts and the animated feature 'Chicken Run'. It shows a couple of animals in a zoo being interviewed. They tell what they like and dislike in the zoo and their cages. Especially a certain predator gets a lot of laughs while he is talking about the space he needs. Director Nick Park won an Oscar for this short film and it is not hard to see why. It is not only funny, but very well made as well. He developed his technique further with 'Wallace & Gromit' and 'Chicken Run', but 'Creature Comforts' already showed what Park was capable of. A terrific animated short, highly recommended.",
         "This is one early effort by famous claymation legend Nick Park. It's the one that came out at the very same time as his first Wallace and Gromit film and also gave him his first Oscar. I think it's a really good film to show your children, for example right after you took them to the zoo. It's about a bunch of zoo animals whose exposure to humans talking every single day has finally taught them a way to speak as well. And not only can they express their words via language, they also know how to gesture the appropriate way during a conversation in order to emphasize their opinion. So they're weighing in on the pros and cons of living on limited space behind bars (or glass walls). What I like the most is that it doesn't try to alter the viewer's opinion exclusively to one side, but approach the issue from both sides that there's good things as well as bad things to it. It's a nicely animated and educating little short film and I'd recommend it. If you like it as well, make sure to check out the TV show with the same names based on this one and made almost 15 years later.",
         "Nick Park's 'Creature Comforts (1989)' beat out competition from the likes of Bruno Bozzetto and Nick Park to win the 1991 Oscar for Best Animated Short. In all honesty, I haven't seen nominee 'Cavallette (1990),' but I still think that the Academy got their ballots mixed up. Just for the record, I find 'A Grand Day Out with Wallace and Gromit (1989)' to be the much better short film, with an entertaining, fully-structured narrative and no shortage of imagination. 'Creature Comforts' has a nice premise and some good jokes, but it's all over so very quickly, leaving only a shallow impression that doesn't bode well for repeat viewings. Nevertheless, the animal characters have that wonderful home-grown \"Wallace and Gromit\" look about them, always a lovely trademark of Aardman Animations, as well as charming British accents that add some sophistication to the zoo inhabitants' gripes. I've always wondered why the British have inherently sophisticated accents. This five-minute short film is basically just a series of very brief vignettes in which zoo animals are interviewed for their opinions on life in captivity. Some animals have some good things to say about it, but most do nothing but complain, particularly a certain South American carnivore who goes on at length about the \"lack of space\" in his enclosure. There's a family of polar bears who are eager to get their opinions across, and miss having steak in their diets. I also liked the turtle that \"tries to spend as little time in here as possible,\" although that is more easily said than done. The quaintness of the dialogue is probably due to the filming technique, which was to interview zoo visitors off the street, request that they behave like animals, and produce the animation around these results. In 2003, 'Creature Comforts' was expanded into a successful TV series, though the even greater success of the \"Wallace and Gromit\" franchise validates, I think, my feelings about which is the better film.",
         "I first watched this short on the DVD Creature Comforts, which contains this and 3 other Aardman short films. Creature Comforts was the short that stood out to me least as being great. Now, the other shorts ranged from excellent to pure genius, so I'm not putting this down, it just isn't as good as the others. Several animals are being interviewed at the zoo. For 5 minutes, we get to hear the perspectives of all sorts of zoo animals and their thoughts on the living conditions and how well they are treated. Animals such as a lonely gorilla, a lemur with eyesight problem and some sort of lion from Brazil all give their input in this sort of humorous short. The best part of this is the animation. So many jokes are thrown in, mostly in the background, making this really feel like it was filmed at a zoo. The interviewed animals, for the most part, are just saying things that would be truthful, and though some humor could be taken from them, it's not usually funny to here the poignant ideas of animals who feel crowded and scared in their small cages. It's more interesting than funny, and because of the mixture of interesting ideas and fun animation full of sight gags, Creature Comforts is a fun short film, but still falls short to some of Aardman's other claymated masterpieces. My rating: *** out of ****. 5 mins."
