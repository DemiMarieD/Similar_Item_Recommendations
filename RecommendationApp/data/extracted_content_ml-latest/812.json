         "Wow, what a film. Enyedi is a masterful director and the blend of fantasy, myth, magic, and spy-oriented suspense in this film is wonderful. Dialogue, acting, story, action, it's all here; wrapped in a mystical package that will keep your eyes dazzled and your mind buzzing even after the end. Anyone who sees this film will get caught up in it. Luckily, it was made in English, so it's a great chance for anti-subtitle viewers to experience Enyedi and perhaps get interested in Hungarian films. Highly recommended.",
         "Not one of the movies that jumps at you, but one that resonates with your sense of destiny. Those of us who crave killing and other mind smut will probably quit watching early on. The plot hovers eerily between a postmodern present and occult fantasies of bygone centuries. The acting is OK, not the center of attention. The dazzling camera work, the musical mix (medieval, german romanticism, new wave etc.) and the wildly creative montage are what stirs you up in this film. I watched with skepticism at first, but by the end I knew I wanted to watch it a second time -- usually a good sign, particularly when the second viewing stimulates the mind even more."
