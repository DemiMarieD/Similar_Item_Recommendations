         "Dr. West and Dr. Cain strike back again! This film is very similar to Frank \"Basket Case\" Henenlotter´s \"Frankenhooker\", but obviously shot with a higher budget and a more elaborated story. It never reached the status from its predecessor, the unique \"Re-Animator\" directed by Stuart Gordon, but it´s worth to be watched in any case! Especially Dr. West´s weird creatures like four spider-looking combined fingers, a strange symbiosis between arm and foot, and a dog whose leg was replaced by a human arm make \"Bride of Re-Animator\" being a bizarre pleasure! At the end Dr. Hill and some creepy zombie maniacs storm the laboratory and destroy the property. Dr. West seems to be dead, but recently I read on IMDb about the production of \"Beyond Re-Animator\" - starring Bruce Abott and Jeffrey Combs...",
         "It's very hard to make a sequel to an absolute masterpiece that can live up to the original. Let us not forget how bad the Exorcist II and the Howling II were. Like the previous titles mentioned, Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator is a true classic in the field of horror, so I was very careful with my expectations towards this film. Yet, several elements showed that it could be a very good film. Jeffrey Combs returned as his memorable Dr. West character and also Dan Cain and Carl Hill are present again. ( well, at least his head is... ) Brian Yuzna took the seat of the director. Good sign, I thought. He knows what he does when it comes to horror. And this film proved itself to be good. It can never reach the level of the original but the complete cast and crew seems to realize that. They just tried to make a sequel worth watching and in that viewing... they succeeded. TINY SPOILERS FROM HERE ... Dr. West is even more fantastic ( and that means more crazy :-] ) to achieve his discovery of re-animating dead bodies. He keeps convincing Dr. Dan Cain to assist him by claiming he can bring back Megan to live ( Dr. Cains love interest from the first film ) West found Megan's hart in the hospital and they shall create a new woman with it. Great !!! Also, the head of the infamous Dr. Carl Hill gets re-animated and he's only after one thing. Nail Dr. West and avenge his dissection ! By this he gets assisted by another doctor. Thing are even getting more difficult for Dr. West when a fanatic detective follows him around... The bride of Re-Animator (a clean tribute to Frankenstein) is 90 minutes of pure fun. Horrorfans won't be disappointed at all. It's a logical sequel to the original, but also a film that could stand to itself. As far as sequels go, this is a good effort. Now, after 13 years a second sequel is about to come. Beyond Re-Animator ( also directed by Yuzna and starring Combs ) is claimed to be a worthy addition to the series as well. I haven't seen it yet but I sure will when I get the chance.",
         "Herbert West and his reluctant sidekick, Dr. Cain, return for another fun, gory round of bringing back the dead in bits and pieces. This time, West cons Cain into an attempt to rebuild his late girlfriend, using her preserved brain and body parts scrounged from the local hospital. From here on in, this film is like a contemporary \"Bride of Frankenstien\", except the special effects (I love the stop-motion \"eye\" spider!) are terrific and there's enough gore to please fans. A underrated sequel. See it~",
         "In Peru, Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) and Dr. Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) are medical volunteers in a civil war with the assistant Francesca Danelli (Fabiana Udenio) and they are researching how to create human life from dead tissue using wounded soldiers as guinea pigs. They return to Miskatonic Hospital and Dan treats a terminal patient, Gloria (Kathleen Kinmont), and gets close to her. When the snoopy Lt. Leslie Chapham (Claude Earl Jones) investigates the Miskatonic Massacre, he learns that body parts are missing in the morgue, and Herbert and Dan become his prime suspects. But Herbert kills the lieutenant and revives him with the serum. Meanwhile, Dr. Graves (Mel Stewart) finds the head of Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) and the green substance that the deceased doctor stole from Herbert, and uses the serum to resurrect Dr. Hill's head. When Gloria dies, Herbert and Dan use her head, with Meg's heart and parts of other women to create the perfect woman. But Lt. Chapham teams up with Dr. Hill to seek revenge against the crazy scientists. \"Bride of Re-Animator\" is a great sequel of the cult \"Re-Animator\", with Dr. Herbert West creating some of the most weird and bizarre creatures. The last time I had seen this film was on 23 March 2000 and today I have just seen it again on VHS. The storyline is very similar to \"Frankenhooker\", both films released in the middle of 1990. I really do not know who might have plagiarized who, but either \"Bride of Re- Animator\" or \"Frankenhooker\" are worthwhile watching. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"A Noiva do Re-Animator\" (\"The Bride of the Re- Animator\")",
         "BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR is a great, gory, funny, all around fun film. This time, the good doctor decides that re-animating alone just isn't enough, he has to play \"Dr. Frankenstein\" and build his own woman!!! (among several other strange \"creations\"). BRIDE isn't quite as ground-breaking as the original RE-ANIMATOR, because we've already been prepared (sort-of) by the first film. But BRIDE has all the same sleazy, funny, over-acted elements of the original. Both are excellent films, as far as BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR is concerned - leave that one where it belongs...on the shelf. Not nearly as original, funny, or gory - the whole style of BEYOND just doesn't fit with the first 2 classics, in my opinion. 8/10 for BRIDE!!!",
         "\"Re -Animator\" extremely well received (quite rightly so) at the time of issue,still stands as a classic of the horror and fantasy genre.Who cared if it was not faithful to Lovecraft?Were the sixties Corman's movies that much faithful to Edgar Allan Poe?Crazy situations,witty lines,and above all an extraordinary skilled actor,Jeffrey -West,Herbert West-Combs who managed to be at once sinister and hilarious. The sequel is not so exciting;like in most of the follow-ups ,the surprising effect has disappeared.Besides ,the script is too derivative ,borrowing from \"the bride of Frankenstein\" (James Whale,1935) and from \"night of the living dead\" (Romero,1968). Only Jeffrey Combs remains.They put the weight on him and he carries it honorably.During the cast and credits,we can hear the same music ,which is absolute plagiarism:Hermann's \"Psycho\".",
         "Dr Herbert West and Dr Dean Cain are back to their old ways. West isn't trying to bring back life now- but actually trying to create life from spare body parts. But along the way they have a police inspector snooping around and Dr. Hill is back. This is a reasonably stylish, but crazy sequel to the very good original. Keeping with the tradition of the original it sticks to the black, campy humour we loved and also being soaked in blood & gore. The story is pretty much the same as the original with West's freaks of nature causing havoc again. Though just like the title implies, it parodies the film 'Bride of Frankenstein'- but the repetitiveness' this time really shows throughout the film. It has some plot holes that aren't explained on from that of the first film- but it didn't fault the story, the humour or pace of the film. The director this time around was the producer from the original, Brian Yuzna- he brings some nice added touches and a morbid sense to the film, though it might have been much better if Stuart Gordon held the realm. The performances are good, with the ever-reliable Jeffrey Combs delivering the eccentrically insane Herbert West, Bruce Abbott as the sympathetic Dean Cain, Claude Earl Jones as the mischievous police detective, Fabiana Udenio as Cain's concerned girlfriend Francesca Danelli and finally David Gale as Dr West's Nemesis the deviously evil head (Yep, that's right) of Dr. Carl Hill. The atmosphere is truly stunning- from the dark basement filled with enthusiastic experiments and West's bizarre creations to the coldness of the eerie mortuary and hospital. The cheese ball performances, along with the witty script and dazzling special effects add up to equal a lot of fun. 3.5/5",
         "Sick and bad! Only to satisfy meat-lovers TRUE SPOILERS I've never been re-animator's fan, but after Stuart Gordon's masterpiece, \"Bride of re-animator\" is more than disappointing. There's no script and plot either at all. That's why Yuzna just uses endless bunch of special make-up as red herring. Have you ever compared Hellraiser 2 with 1st Hellraiser? This is just the same. Bad, really bad. West and Caine use the basement of a house by the cemetery as a lab. Nothing new really goes on the whole movie besides what we already expect to happen. Everything's too slow. In the end there's no culmination. Just an army of living dead raising as the \"beauty\" bride of re-animator breaks the capsule with reagent and it spreads to the other side of the wall between the lab and the crypt. Terror to watch! The only good part is the one shutting talking cut-off head with apple. 2 out of 10. Nothing to recommend! Third re-animator is much better than this one. And this is Yuzna's worst movie. Almost as bad as it gets! Sorry!",
         "Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Coombs) is at it again! Having not learned anything from his experiences in 1985's \"Re-Animator,\" the mad scientist continues to simultaneously play both doctor and God. Culling spare body parts from the local university, West promises to his loyal buddy Dan (Bruce Abbott) to restore the love of his life, Megan (who you may remember as being played by Barbara Crampton in the original). It seems Meg's heart continues to beat, and while Dan is distracted by a new love (Fabiana Udenio) and a dying patient (Kathleen Kinmont), Dr. West is determined to re-unite the two lovers by any means necessary because, well, what else are friends for? Taking the reigns from director Stuart Gordon, Brian Yuzna (\"Return Of The Living Dead III\") has his work cut out for him. Following up a certified cult-classic such as \"Re-Animator\" is no easy task, and yet Yuzna's follow-up, \"Bride Of Re-Animator,\" works hard to maintain the same level of zany good times as delivered by its predecessor. Retaining the pitch-black humor of the original almost to a fault, Yuzna's film is steeped in tragedy, revenge and outright insanity. Coombs is in top form as Dr. Herbert West, while Abbott is admittedly given little to do beyond tearing himself between his various loves. No matter, because the film is endlessly entertaining and utterly twisted. The special effects are quite the spectacle unto themselves, boiling over into a wacky and truly delicious final act. If there's one gripe to be had with \"Bride\" it's that the film lacks a cohesive pace. More often than not, story is forsaken for the sake of various undead antics and shenanigans (see the wife-beating detective hot on Dr. West and Dan's trail for reference). Sometimes the film tries a little too hard perhaps, but that's part of its charm. It's all or nothing with Yuzna, and his hyped-up take on H.P. Lovecraft's mythology does not disappoint. Those seeking a gloriously gory and at times touching horror story would do well to find themselves hitched to \"Bride Of Re-Animator.\"",
         "How did these boys get jobs at the hospital? Just how many deaths do you have to cause in Arkum to mess up your resume? Bride of Re-Animator isn't as good as the first, but it has the same feeling, the same dark humor. It owes as much to Bride of Frankenstein as it does to Re-Animator, and that's pretty good parentage. Jeffrey Combs is once again the standout followed by some wonderful monsters (four fingers, a thumb, and an eye wired together would make a pretty good pet).\"My God! They're using tools!\" With one line, Jeffrey Combs sweeps in and rescues this whole movie. Okay, Combs has all the good lines, and without him, this would be a sad little sequel. Bruce Abbott still can't act, Udenio (who made her debut in Passion Flower Hotel) is no Babs Crampton, and even David Gale's talents are underused, since we only get to see him from the neck up - though I was amused to see where his character went, given Herbert West's comment in the original film. Plotwise, no attempt is made to explain how Dr West (Combs) escaped in the original movie; we first see him and reluctant partner Cain (Abbott) in a Peruvian civil war, for no readily apparent reason. Soon, they're back in the US of A, continuing their experiments while a local cop, investigating the \"Miskatonic Massacre\", closes in. Far too obviously, this aims for Bride of Frankenstein, but watching West wax lyrical as he flies into delusions of god-hood covers a great deal of weakness. The effects are nicely done too, though the idea they can now re-animate anything, is only used to a fraction of its potential. Their integration into the storyline...well, they aren't. Everything moves in a herky-jerky fashion towards an impressively excessive climax, largely failing to build upon the original, or even re-invent it, and even Danny Elfman's songs seem like they were tossed off over a wet weekend. However, no film can be entirely condemned with speeches such as, \"The only blasphemy is to wallow in in-SIG-nif-i-cance!\", uttered by a B-master like Combs."
