      "synopsis": "It is September 1961, two years after the original Grease gang were Rydell High seniors in the first movie and a new academic year is just beginning at Rydell High School ('Back To School Again'). The Pink Ladies are now led by the beautiful Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer), who feels she has \"outgrown\" her relationship with the arrogant leader of the The T-Birds, Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed) during summer break. A new arrival comes in the form of clean-cut English student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield), the cousin of Sandy Olsson (the character played by Olivia Newton-John in the first Grease movie). Michael quickly becomes smitten with Stephanie, despite the gentle warning of the sole remaining lead character from the first film, Frenchy (Didi Conn), who is returning to Rydell High to get her diploma was told about Michael's arrival in a letter from Sandy and helps Michael get settled into the school atmosphere as Sandy's behest. Michael takes an instant liking to Stephanie, but Frenchy tells him that she will not date him since he is not a T-Bird. At the local bowling alley, a competitive game ('Score Tonight') turns sour due to the animosity between Johnny and Stephanie. Johnny flirts with Stephanie's friend and fellow Pink Lady, Paulette Rebchuck (Lorna Luft), to make Stephanie jealous, and she retaliates by kissing the next man who walks in the door, which happens to be Michael. Bemused by this unexpected kiss, Michael attempts to ask her out the next day at an audition for the school talent show, but discovers that she has a very specific vision of her ideal man ('Cool Rider'). He realizes that he will only win her affection if he turns himself into a cool rider, and begins saving up for a motorcycle by selling completed homework assignments to the academically-challenged T-Birds. Michael buys the bike, fixes it up and spends all his spare time after school learning to ride it. Following an unusual, largely interactive biology lesson ('Reproduction') given by new substitute teacher Mr. Stuart (Tab Hunter), a gang of rival motorcyclists called the Cycle Lords (led by Balmudo, who also played \"Leo\" in the first film and also a rival of the T-Birds) surprise the T-Birds at the bowling alley. Before the fight starts, a lone anonymous biker, wearing all black clothing as well as a motorcycle helmet and dark goggles to cover his face, appears and defeats the enemy gang, performing impressive stunts and leaping over police cars to disappear into the night ('Who's That Guy?'). Stephanie is instantly fascinated with the stranger. The following day at school, Frenchy tells Michael about that motorcycle chase and a strange guy swept Zinone out of her bobby socks. Michael confides in Frenchy he's the one and just as he was about to tell Frenchy his game plan, Zinone and the other Pink Ladies come into the room. That's when Michael attempts to tell Stephanie that he is the \"Cool Rider\", but becomes tongue-tied. Frenchy notices a patch on Rhonda's nose. She is also wearing glasses similar to the ones Dinah Manoff wore at one point during the first movie when she played Marty. In a short comic scene, one of the T-Birds, Louis DiMucci (Peter Frechette), attempts to trick his sweetheart Sharon (Maureen Teefy) into losing her virginity to him by taking her to Michael's uncle's fallout shelter and faking a nuclear explosion ('Let's Do It For Our Country'), but the plan backfires and she runs off in horror. Stephanie is surprised again by the Cool Rider while working at her after school job at her family's gas station, and they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride. Just as Michael is about to reveal his identity, they are interrupted by the arrival of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies; before Michael disappears again, he tells Stephanie that he will see her at the talent show, in which the Pink Ladies and T-Birds are performing. Stephanie wonders how the Cool Rider knew about the talent show but fails to deduce it could be a Rydell High School student since only they knew about the show. Johnny, enraged by Stephanie's new romance, threatens to fight the \"Cool Rider\" if he sees him with her again, and the group has an argument about who belongs to whom. The Pink Ladies exit haughtily, although this has little effect on the T-Birds' innate self-confidence as they stroll off in the night ('Prowlin'). At school, Stephanie's poor grades in English lead her to accept Michael's offer of help with her essay on Shakespeare's Hamlet, but although she has warmed to him considerably, he still cannot reveal his double identity. By this point, Stephanie has begun to realize that, despite his shy, bookworm outward appearance, Michael is a kind, good hearted guy who genuinely cares about her. She then slowly begins to discover that she has similar feelings for him, and starts to reciprocate his crush. These events are not lost on their mutual acquaintances, and Johnny, upon seeing them together in a discussion, demands that Stephanie quit the Pink Ladies for his \"rep\" and subtly threatens that the T-Birds will beat up Michael if she refuses (\"Don't damage the rep we won't damage new friends.\"). Stephanie is visibly upset by this but refuses to quit the Pink Ladies. Although still head over heels for the Cool Rider, interactions with Michael reveal that she has become smitten with him as well, as Michael ponders with himself over his continuing charade he puts out to Stephanie. ('Charades'). The night of the talent show, Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet outside the school, but are instantly ambushed by the T-Birds who pursue Michael in a motorcycle chase, with Stephanie and the Pink Ladies following in a car. They pursue him to a closed-off construction site which conceals a deadly drop, and the biker's absence suggests that he has perished below, leaving Stephanie inconsolable thinking her Cool Rider is dead although both the T Birds & Pink Ladies try to convince her that he must have survived and made the jump and will show up again. At the talent show, the T-Birds tie up the competition for their act in the boys locker room and drench them in the showers to ensure their winning. During the Pink Ladies' number ('A Girl For All Seasons'), Stephanie is overcome and stops singing her part and sinks to the stage floor. Oblivious to the audience, she enters a dreamlike fantasy world where she is reunited with her mystery biker in a sort of \"biker heaven\" backdrop \"([Love Will Turn] Back The Hands Of Time)\". As her reverie finishes, it appears she has been singing a solo; she is duly named winner of the contest, and crowned the queen of the upcoming luau, with Johnny hailed as king. The school year ends with the graduation luau the next day ('Rock-A-Hula Luau') during which Johnny and Stephanie later engage in another argument while being carried onto the pool in a floating throne. The Cycle Lords suddenly appear and begin to destroy the celebration, but are stopped by the emergence of the Cool Rider, much to the surprise of Stephanie. After roundly defeating the Cycle Lords and leaping over the pool on his motorcycle, he finally reveals himself to all in attendance to be Michael. After his initial shock, Johnny offers him a T-Bird jacket and welcomes him into the gang, and Stephanie finally accepts that she can have \"two for the price of one\" a Cool Rider and a Shakespeare. All of the couples pair off (Michael/Stephanie, Johnny/Paulette, Lewis/Sharon, Davey/Dolores & Rhonda/Goose), happily at graduation as the class of 1962 (Note: Davey was not a senior so he doesn't graduate then) sings ('We'll Be Together'). The credits start rolling and just like in the first movie, it's in the style of a yearbook.",

         "You know, Grease 2 has taken a lot of flack & extensive bad reviews for not living up to the original. I really don't think that is to fair considering the cast was totally different. Granted there was no super-star-pop-icon like Olivia Newton-John. There wasn't the hot-70's & 80's actor John Travolta. However, there were some great stars in this film. The writing may have been a little less than perfect...the direction might not have been up to par. But for me, being EXTREMLY young when both Grease 1 & 2 came out, I never compared the two. I think they are two different films with the same \"type\" of concept. The music was good. The dance scenes are good. & yes, even the story is okay. Grease mania is about being a devoted fan... that is something I am. I liked both of these films on two different levels. Grease without a doubt is the better of the two. But this one is not as bad as the negativity everyone feeds into it. If see one, see the other. Just note that they are both FUN movies! Nothing more. The sequel centers around Sandy's cousin Michael. He is in love with Stephanie, & trys EVERYTHING possible to win her over. The Pink Ladies are still cooler than ever. The T-Birds are not as tuff, but are sexy! 1-10 Grease(10) Grease2(8) Z.",
         "I dont understand why this movie is being slammed so much. The first Grease is a classic and its always impossible to follow a classic with an equal sequel. I happened to enjoy this sequel better than the original. I thought it was funnier and I enjoyed the music in this movie better than the first. Especially the \"Reproduction\"scene...you can't watch that and not agree that that is one funny part of the movie. I also thought Maxwell Caulfield was GORGEOUS as Michael. I overall give this movie 7/10.",
         "I grew up with both of the Grease films but I must say, Grease 2 is my favourite and there are many reasons. It does have the same kind of formula as the orginal Grease but is dealt with in a completely different way. Danny faniced Sandy back, but Stephanie (played by the young Michelle Pfhieffer) doesn't even give Michael (Caulfield) a second glance. Also, instead of cars, a motorbike is the new 'thing' to have. Michael Carrington, a straight A student from England, transfers to Rydell High and is immediately put into the 'nerd' category and the T-Birds brand him 'Shakesphere'. He is smart, extremely uncool and very shy. Stephenie, the leader of the Pink ladies has come back from the summer holidays having broke up with Johnny, the T-Birds leader, having grown out of him. Johnny is clearly still interested in Stephanie but she doesn't want to know. Her loyalty to the Birds has faltered as she wants someone even cooler. First day back Stephanie sees the Birds picking on Michael and defends him, from that moment on Michael vows to become a T-Bird and win her heart. So there is the story, but what Grease is famous for is the memorable songs, and this film has them! There are 12 songs on the soundtrack and there isn't one that I really skip. The music has changed since the first Grease as it was made in the decade of the 80's. Its early 80's rock that you are getting yourself into for the most part. You have the romanitc songs (Turn Back The Hands Of Time, We'll Be Together, Charades), the heavy rock songs (Cool Rider, Who's That Guy), the happy-go-dancing songs (Score Tonight, Back To School), the sweet songs (Love For All Seasons) and the down right silly songs (Reproduction, Prowlin'). These are all songs that stick in your mind and just can't stop singing them to yourself. All the songs are quality and stand on their own. Absolutely brilliant soundtrack. What would Grease be without the classic characters? We have the T-Birds who are actually not cool in any way or form, its only the leader (Johnny) who is 'cool', the others just follow his lead. Johnny is a classic character who makes you laugh over and over again, its hilarious whenever he loses his cool. Frenchy unfortunately doesn't have a big part in the film but nethertheless she is there. The coach is back but you only see him twice if that. Mrs Mcgee and Blanche are also back making quite a funny duo as they did last time. Two new teachers; a very sexy female who always has low cut tops on and pays $500 for her hair (according to the cheer leading twins). She falls for the unlikely nerdy substitute teacher, Mr Stewart, who teaches the immortal 'Reproduction' lesson. The new Pink ladies have very distinctive characters, one of them is obsessed with her nose and doesnt come into it much (Rhonda), Paulette is somewhat the second leader in my view who has a crush on Johnny, she does have her own intentions but she does care for her friends; nothing like Riz. Sharon is a bubbly flirty character who is the prey of one of the T-Birds (Louis) to get into bed. Then there is Dolores, Paulettes little sister who isn't a Pink lady but a pink lady mascot, she looks about 12, mouthy and carries a skate board everywhere. The performances were actually very good in my humble opinion, especially Max Caulfield who seemed very uncomfortable... and that is the way Michael is supposed to be! He wins me over with those puppy innocent eyes, then when he is the mysterious guy he acts completely cool. Max was a triumph. His voice isn't the best thing in the world but he didn't sing that much anyway. Michelle Pfhieffer was wonderful as an actress and singer. When you hear her sing you won't need to wonder why Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted her as Evita in his film musical and NOT Madonna. She shines in 'Cool Rider'. The whole cast was believable. I normally sit back in films and watch peoples performances and dig at them but I didnt do that at all in this movie. This film has a lot of negative feedback as every one compares it to the Original Grease. My opinion isnt common, preferring this one to the original, therefore my advice to you is to forget the first movie when watching this one. It needs a chance!",
         "I used to work in a record store in the late 80s/early 90s, and one thing we sold a copy of at least every week was the Grease 2 soundtrack. I used to ask the people buying about it, and they all acknowledged that it was one of the worst movies, but that there is something about it so lovable, and that the songs are terrible, but there's something about them so charming\u0085 Now that I've seen the movie, I know what they mean. This movie is appalling in nearly every respect, but there's just something about it--perhaps how brazenly appalling it is--that gives it an almost hypnotic fascination. I love how the producers made only the most surface-level attempt to even appear 50s. The clothes, hairstyles, songs, and ways of speaking all scream 80s. I haven't the slightest idea why they decided to dress Michelle Pheiffer in things that essentially look like sweatshirts for the first half of the movie. And she's got on those huge dark glasses all the time\u0085 making her look like early Debbie Harry. You just really have to wonder. As for the sets\u0085 I don't think I've ever seen such low production values in a movie released by a major studio. The sets also are brazenly 80s\u0085 When Michelle is being tutored, they are OBVIOUSLY in an Elias Brothers Big Boy! Couldn't they at least have found a 50s-themed diner? There is also a scene showing guys motorcycling through a subdivision that looks like 1985 Westland, Michigan, and another time--my favorite--when Michelle and someone are sitting out in what is obviously some municipal park, with a huge superhighway with massive 18-wheelers barreling by in the background. I really have to take my hat off. What's also charmingly appalling is how the producers made NO attempt to recapture ANYTHING you may have loved about the first movie. And I tell you, this movie makes the original look like Gone With the Wind. You really should be required to see both to appreciate what a graceful, charming movie the first one is. This is so obviously just a craven cash-in by whoever owned the rights (that's you, Allan Carr!) that, in some perverse way, only makes it the more appealing. Everyone in this movie looks embarrassed, but none more so that Michelle Pheiffer. Obviously WRONG in every way for the part, and obviously PAINFULLY aware that she's going to look like an idiot on movie screens across America, poor Michelle seems afraid to really put herself behind any expression, movement, or song, as though by staying as still as possible she can diminish the damage. The poor girl, you can really feel her pain, especially as she sings 'Cool Rider,' and tries to dance up that ladder and down. The thing about musicals is that the characters have to appear to be transported with joy or anguish to the point that they break out in song, and poor Michelle is just so embarrassed that it really clunks. Of course, ALL the musical sequences clunk massively. If you're not buying a musical sequence it just looks like a bunch of people idiotically moving around on a set\u0085 and that's what we got here. Those poor, poor individuals. I was amazed how poor the sound quality was. I hear this has been improved on the DVD, but it's quite clear that they were aware that these people COULD NOT SING, and tried to bury their voices as deep as possible. What else? Well, I guess that's about it. Truly poor direction just adds to the general malaise. If you like bad, cheesy movies, they just don't get any better than this. If you are a fan of the original, you should definitely watch this, as it'll just make you love the chemistry, charming songs, and graceful story arc all the more. --- Check out my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com",
         "This film to me is not that bad, most the people who have seen it compare it to the original. What I reckon is that if this was just a film and not a sequel to Grease it would probably be appreciated more. In my opinion I like Grease 2 better, I actually found Grease to be quite boring, but hey that's just me. In Grease 2 I like the songs better and the guys are much more better looking than the first one. Overall this movie for me is quite entertaining and I like it, and I certainly do not compare it to the first one as it is a whole new different movie and storyline. So if you haven't seen Grease 2 before because people say it's crap and that it's a waste of time, at least give it a chance and watch it, it might surprise you.",
         "When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. So, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as \"brilliant\" or \"fun\" or \"better than the original Grease,\" you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass. If, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption. For the sake of criticism, I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows\u0085 1. In a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. In Grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless. Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way (\"Score Tonight,\" \"Reproduction,\" \"Do It For Our Country,\" and \"Prowlin'\") without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. Plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance. 2. The T-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang, Michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. But of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the T-birds. 3. Since Michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. So aside from being pretty (I guess), she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael's attraction to her. I could go on and on, but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. I will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake: Grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss. Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me.",
         "Okay, this movie is absolutely ridiculous, and if I was only rating its surface quality, my score would be much lower. The plot and dialogue are fraught with silliness, and if you watch carefully there are numerous little mistakes that should have been edited out. (Spoiler: Michael's motorcycle right out in plain view of Steff, with him leaning on it, when he's hiding his \"cool rider\" identity from her.) Some of the songs are especially painful, particularly in the ultra-serious motorcycle heaven scene, and the choreography is just bad. Watching Michelle Pfeiffer dance and sing \"Cool Rider\" is terrible--she should not be dancing that way, or singing at all. One has to wonder why Crater Face was included as a \"villain\" in this film, because now his tormenting of the high school students is just sad. Then again, I have a soft spot for Grease 2 that I don't have for the too oft-shown first film. For one, just to get this out of the way, Maxwell Caulfield is gorgeous in this movie. If you hate the film, you can always (assuming you swing that way) just watch him. It's not as if his acting is bad, and neither is Michelle's, though her lines are. And Grease 2 is funny, in its own way--you simply can't watch Michelle dance and sing without laughing. There is a lot to laugh at--and even with--in this musical. \"Reproduction\" is fun to watch, if certainly campy, and a couple of the T-birds are entertaining (Leif Green and Peter Frechette's characters). As I said, I have a fondness for this movie that is pretty inexplicable, I know. It's not a classic film by any means. Still, I'd say if you're looking for a so-bad-it's-good that still isn't too incredibly awful, to laugh at with your friends, Grease 2 is worth a rental.",
         "I think the reason this movie did so badly, and most people don't like it is because of the constant comparison to the original \"Grease.\" Of course, compared to the original it would come up short. but, try to watch it not as a sequel, but just as a movie in itself, and I think most people would like it more. Granted, it does have it's cheesy moments, such as the \"(Love Will) Turn Back The Hands Of Time\" number, but it's a nice, sweet movie. I loved it, personally. Rent it, it's lots of fun!",
         "now i can understand all the bad comments about this film, the acting is bad, the editing and the continuity is awful, but for some reason i love it. its the one film that i know every single word off by heart. The songs may not have an all time classic like \"hopelessly devoted\" like grease 1, but the vast majority of the songs are pretty strong and memorable. It camp kitsch at its finest. and you'd be surprised just how many people out there love this film. on a certain social networking site, there thousands of us in appreciation groups, and they are a pretty mixed bunch (male - female - somewhere in between) not everyone it going to love this film, but its worth watching with an open mind!",
         "Depending on when you saw this film relative to when you saw the original \"Grease,\" your viewpoints probably differ as to the quality of this movie. I saw both within a month of each other at age 13. I hated the original and loved this one. As I've gotten older, I've come to recognize that the original is a better piece of work, overall. The music from the original is better when taken as a whole. The supporting cast of the original has better players. The storyline doesn't seem as convoluted at times. But there's something about this movie that holds on to you. It appeals much more to the age group pictured in the movie (i.e., junior-high and high-schoolers). The song \"Cool Rider\" and the scenes that accompany it in the movie rival anything in the original. The dialog is better in places and the interplay between the male and female leads are better, I believe, than in the original. The original movie's pairing of Travolta and Newton-John gave us a dimwit trying to woo a goodie-two-shoes girl whose performance was oftentimes wooden and uncomfortable. This one gives us Caulfield and Pfeiffer, and the interplay between an intelligent, wise-beyond-his-years male lead and the \"wild child\" female lead. Adrian Zmed's supporting performance as Johnny still cracks me up and is one of the few performances from this movie that still entertain me as an adult. That's because outside of the performances of accomplished character actors Christopher McDonald, Eve Arden and Dody Goodman, the rest of this cast is just plain bad. Some of it is bad acting, some of it is miscasting and a lot of it is bad writing. What we're left with today, 20-something years later, is a movie that made a really good attempt to build on the original, but in the end, was the soufflé that fell. It's still better than most want to admit, but it could have stood a couple of rewrites and a little more attention to detail in the prospective cast interview room."
