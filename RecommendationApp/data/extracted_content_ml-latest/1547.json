Knowing his father will once again make him bring Shiloh back to Judd, he makes a home for the dog in an old shed up the hill from the Prestons' house and hides him from his family.

         "Heartwarming story with real values for family viewing. Well written script is faithful to the Phyllis Reynolds Naylor bestseller which won the Newbery Award. Scott Wilson excels as Jud Travers bringing a palpable menace to the character while at the same time making him a fully believable human being with his own back story. Blake Heron shines as the boy who falls in love with the dog and fights to keep him. An engaging performance from a young man with promise. Rod Steiger adds distinction to the film and emotional weight in his portrayal of the kindly store owner. Anne Dowd is the perfect Mom, gently chiding and always loving. Michael Moriarty lays down the law as the father with a sense of humor and engagement with his children. Dale Rosenbloom wrote the screenplay and directed the film with a finely tuned sense of the heartbeat of the story. A film that will be evergreen for the generations.",
         "kids who say this is a corny film may want to watch it when they get older- they will appreciate seeing the good side of human nature which is only brought out by a dog.(Hint: when you are an adult, kids, you will not will not be in such a hurry to grow up and be cynical). Shiloh is a beagle who was abused, and adopted by a boy who gives him a good life. The father is portrayed by Michael Moriarty; the veterinarian is empathic, as played by Rod Steiger. Please watch this film. It is great for younger kids- but also for adults who need a lift. The film was very highly rated by Siskel and Ebert, who also highly recommended it. 9/10",
         "I think that this is just the cutest little movie! It is about the special relationship between a boy and a stray puppy that he finds, the little floppy ears are the most irresistible thing in the world. This movie was well done, especially with the casting. Michael Moriarty (Bang the Drum Slowly and Law & Order) plays a believable discipline-oriented father. He turns out to be the character that you both love and hate. I saw this with my two nieces (4 and 6 years old) and we all cheered. I might warn though that there are some scenes which imply abuse of animals, so be sure to watch this movie with your children.",
         "This movie was a cute movie about a boy and a dog that absolutely love eachother but the dog's owner is very, very protective of all of his dogs and doesnt want Marty(the boy) to have Shiloh, its a touching story and movie, i personally thought the book was better but dont take my word for it, go out and watch it for yourself!!!",
         "I can't remember the first time I saw this movie, but it's a great movie for anyone. Be warned; there's animal abuse in this movie, though. The scenes where Judd Travers (Scott Wilson, I think?) is abusing Shiloh will wrench your heart; it did mine. I literally cry every time I see them. The first time Judd abuses Shiloh is at the beginning of the movie: Judd's out hunting with his dogs. Judd hits him with the butt of his rifle for barking and scaring a raccoon, then he kicks the poor puppy, then he tries to shoot him, then he yells at him to come back. 'Come back' to someone who's abused you and tried to kill you? If anyone thought a dog would do that, they'd be crazy. I like the end of the movie. Marty gets to keep Shiloh.",
         "To begin, Shiloh is a very well-written novel. It deals with a boy who does what he believes is right in order to save a runaway dog from its abusive owner. It also deals with honesty, loyalty, friendship and standing up for what one feels is right. The movie, while a lot is changed, still worked for me. Despite some awkward editing (some shots last for about a second before cutting to another, but I'm sure I'll see worse), the movie was still good for me. Sure, they made \"finally getting the dog from Judd Travers\" much harder than in the novel. As many put it, even though Judd Travers is a very cruel character, he states that he had been abused by his father during his childhood and never understood or got sympathy and anyone with a dark past can relate to him (not me, but I am against child abuse so I understand). Another good point is the acting, Blake Heron acts like he cares about the dog, Scott Wilson really puts effort into acting like a man who never understood sympathy, kindness, love and nurturing and Rod Steiger's performance as Doc Wallace is also well-done, especially during the scene where he encourages Marty to stand up for what's right by recounting a memory from the past. I bought this film and Shiloh Season from a secondhand store, but I have yet to read the second novel and watch the second film, so I'll see how they are. I know this film is not 100% true to the original novel, but I have heard of worse book-to-movie adaptations. As someone who is against animal cruelty, I loved this movie and the novel to the point where I recommend giving both a try.",
         "If you look at the jacket, you would expect Shiloh to be about a cute dog that has an I.Q. of 150 who saves the day, or who perhaps accompanies some children on a long hike, fending off wolves and cougars. Or perhaps a dog that makes messes. It is nothing like that at all. Shiloh is a cute, but completely ordinary dog, who does nothing more exciting than licking people's faces and gobbling food. It is a morality tale. There is the evil Christian who believes God gave us animals to use as we please, including sadistic pleasure. There is the postman father who equates right with legal. Then there is the hero, a boy about ten, who argues articulately again and again for a higher heart-centred morality motivated by his loving caring for the young dog Shiloh. He gradually wins over his mom, his dad and even the evil Christian. There is plenty of ambiguity and conflict. It is not a totally black and white tale. Even though the boy is only ten, he is one of the most heroic figures in movies. The sudden happy ending did not ring true for me. A more plausible ending would have had the villain eaten alive by his dogs, or some such bad karma.",
         "Everything about this film is clichéd. From the one dimensional nuclear conservative family values to the animal rights message, this movie reeks of something that is 50 years past it's best viewed by date. From the characters to the plots, this film puts me in mind of a long Leave it to Beaver episode with a little more edge. But it's cliché after cliché after cliché... simply horrible. Even my 5 year old didn't like it. Acting, especially Blake Heron, was great, but the cast was let down by the plastic screenplay. I would have liked to have seen a little more subtlety, let the viewers discover things instead of just throwing so many clichéd images and lines of dialog at them. Kids are smarter than some give them credit for. Let them discover gravity by watching an apple fall, not by smacking them on the head with an anvil.",
         "\"From the 'Newbery Award'-winning book,\" proclaims the Warner Bros. synopsis, \"Shiloh, an adorable beagle, runs away from his neglectful owner, and is found by young Marty (Blake Heron). Marty knows that Shiloh belongs to someone else, but is determined to save the dog from more neglect. Against the wishes of the dog's owner (Scott Wilson) and his father (Michael Moriarty), Marty risks everything to make the dog his own.\" Good summation of a great film for young children, based on a classic novel. If memory serves, there was no incongruously flirty \"tomboy\" girlfriend in Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's original story; this character was played up to give the film greater appeal, probably. Still, Dale Rosenbloom does well in capturing the essence of the novel, which thoughtfully plays up the issue of animal rights. \"Shiloh\" and the humans perform well, with Mr. Wilson (as Judd Travers) adept at conveying the villainous owner of Shiloh is actually a wounded man. He has the right to kick Shiloh around, or does he? ******* Shiloh (11/10/96) Dale Rosenbloom ~ Blake Heron, Scott Wilson, Michael Moriarty, Ann Dowd",
         "I really liked this movie. It was believable, and the message about standing up for what's right is always worth repeating. No special effects or explosions, just a simple, poignant story told in straightforward fashion. Marty, a boy of about 13 who lives in the country with his family, one day discovers Shiloh, a puppy who has run away. It turns out that Shiloh belongs to an ornery hunter named Judd who lives nearby. Judd only sees Shiloh as a tool for hunting and doesn't believe animals have any rights. For Marty, however, Shiloh quickly becomes a friend and companion. The story unfolds around the struggle between Marty and Judd for ownership of Shiloh. That may sound a little corny, but issues of family, honesty, respect for other species and the importance of keeping promises soon become involved. As an animal lover I found the story compelling and I'm going to watch it again soon with my grandchildren."
