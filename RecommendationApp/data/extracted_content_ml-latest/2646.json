         "content": "The cure for your ills?\r\n\r\nHouse Of Dracula is out of Universal Pictures and is directed by Erle C. Kenton. It's written by Edward T. Lowe Jr and stars Lon Chaney Jr, John Carradine, Martha O'Driscol, Glenn Strange, Lionel Atwill, Jane Adams & Onslow Stevens. \r\n\r\nIt's a sequel to House Of Frankenstein that was released the previous year and again sees the three principal Universal monsters (Frankenstein's Monster, Count Dracula & The Wolf Man) thrust together. Plot basically involves Dracula (Carradine) & Larry Talbot/Wolf Man (Chaney Jr) turning up at Dr. Edelmann's (Stevens) mansion seeking a cure for their respective creature afflictions. Murder, blood and the unearthing of Frankenstein's monster ensues.\r\n\r\nWell it's better than House Of Frankenstein at least, but it's still tired and weary. A commercial success at the box office, it marks the last hurrah for Universal's monster pictures before the creatures went off lampooning with comedy duos. The film clocks in at just 67 minutes so with that it doesn't out stay its welcome. While the additions of Adams as a \" beautiful\" hunchback assistant, and Edelmann going through a Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde like crisis prove to be entertaining ingredients in the bonkers monster stew.\r\n\r\nPacked with flaws (both narratively and technically) that smacks of a rushed cash cow job, and unintentionally funny, House Of Dracula is watchable for Universal Monsters purists only. 5/10",

      "synopsis": "NOTE: Sequel to \"House of Frankenstein\" (1944) Dr Franz Edelman [Onslow Stevens] of Visaria has a reputation for treating patients with strange diseases. Consequently, Count Dracula [John Carradine] (known to the outside world as Baron Latoes) and Larry Talbot [Lon Chaney, Jr] (aka The Wolfman) come to Edelman in search of cures for their problems. After securing a blood sample from Dracula, Edelman finds that his blood contains an unknown parasite. Edelman thinks he can create an antitoxin and administer it through a series of blood transfusions. In the meantime, Dracula can sleep in his coffin in the basement. Talbot doesn't fare as well. When he calls, Edelman is unable to see him, so Talbot races to the village jail and asks to be confined in a cell. When Edelman arrives, he is able to personally witness the transformation of Talbot into the Wolfman and agrees to attempt a cure. After examining Talbot, Edelman announces that pressure on his brain is causing his glands to secrete an abnormal supply of the hormone that causes him to transform. Fortunately, in an attempt to help his nurse Nina [Jane Adams] become cured of her hunchback, Edelman has been working on a mold which softens calcium salts (i.e., bone). This mold might also be used to reshape Talbot's skull and take some of the pressure off his brain. Unfortunately, it will take at least a month to produce enough of the mold for the operations. Distraught at the thought of becoming the Wolfman one more time, Talbot attempts suicide by jumping from a cliff. Thinking that the rushing river below might have washed Talbot into some nearby caves, Edelman is lowered into the caves where he discovers perfect conditions for growing the molds and convinces Talbot to return for treatment. He also discovers the body of the Frankenstein monster [Glenn Strange] as well as a secret passageway between the cave and his laboratory. In the meantime, Dracula has become smitten with Edelman's other nurse, the luscious Melissa Morelle [Martha O'Driscoll], and tries to entice her into joining him. But Nina oversees the Baron casting no reflection in a mirror and reports this observation to Edelman who rushes to the garden in time to save Melissa. Edelman tells Dracula that another transfusion must be done immediately. This time, however, Dracula reverses the blood flow so that some of his blood contaminates Edelman. When Edelman realizes what Dracula has done, he moves Dracula's coffin into the sunlight and destroys him, releasing the hold on Melissa. But now Edelman starts transforming. During the day he is himself, but at night he surges with the urge to kill. Knowing that his time is limited, Edelman operates on Talbot. That night, from his wheelchair by the window, Talbot sees Edelman hop a cart. Edelman subsequently kills the cartdriver, and the villagers follow him home thinking that he is Talbot. The police interview both Edelman and Talbot but agree that Talbot is physically incapable of such activity. Talbot has put two and two together and promises Edelman that he will say nothing until Edelman is able to operate on Nina. That night, however, Edelman reawakens the Frankenstein monster. Nina tries to stop him, but Edelman strangles her. Talbot shoots Edelman, and the Frankenstein monster turns on Talbot and begins destroying the laboratory. The monster is killed in a fire, and Talbot walks off into the moonlight with Melissa. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl.]",

         "MORD39 RATING: **1/2 out of **** HOUSE OF DRACULA is a small notch below the previous HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, mostly because the novelty of the three monsters theme feels repetitive. Just the same, it's much fun and a fitting conclusion to the \"serious\" monster pictures in a beloved series. John Carradine is capable again as Dracula, but Lon Chaney's Wolfman stint is really automatic by now. Once again, Glenn Strange is an impressive Frankenstein Monster, albeit a brief one for the last minute or two. The real attraction this time is Onslow Stevens in the role of a kindly sympathetic doctor who sets out to \"cure\" Dracula and the Wolfman, but ultimately becomes a sort of Jekyll/Hyde as a result of his efforts. Stevens is excellent in this film, and takes center stage. Still, there is a feeling of \"yesterday's leftovers\" with the film. Stock footage is lifted again from GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and there is a general aura around the proceedings which suggests that it was thrown together more hastily. These negative comments in no way make for an unsatisfactory view, however...HOUSE OF DRACULA is the last of its line, and still an essential Universal Horror.",
         "House of Dracula is another of the series of all-star monster extravaganzas produced by Universal in the 40s. This one deals with The Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.) and Dracula (John Carradine) coming to scientist Onslow Stevens for a cure for what ails them. Along the way they find the Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) and try to help him as well. Well, we all know that things will not go smoothly and the monsters will soon be running amok. Carradine, playing Dracula for the second time, is quite effective in the role. He gives it his own interpretation and doesn't try to copy Bela Lugosi. Chaney gives a sympathetic performance as the doomed Lawrence Talbot. Stevens, in a rare leading role, also stands out as the doctor. The Frankenstein monster has little to do until the final minutes of the film. As monster films go, this isn't one of the all-time greats, but on the other hand it does provide 67 minutes of solid entertainment.",
         "House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as House of Frankenstein from the year before; namely that Universal's three most famous monsters; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man are appearing in the movie together. Naturally, the film is rather messy therefore, but the fact that all three monsters are there is usually enough to ensure that the film's sixty seven minutes don't become boring. It's obvious that the idea of making another monster mash came into the writer's head before an actual plot did, as the yarn we're given isn't exactly without holes. The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at Dr. Edelman's home asking for a cure for his vampirism. Then, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees Lawrence Talbot, a.k.a. The Wolf Man turn up asking for a cure for his affliction! It turns out that Dracula is on the prowl for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot really is serious. When it turns out that he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf, The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea...where he ends up finding Frankenstein's Monster. Overall, this film isn't as good as the earlier House of Frankenstein. The 1944 film put its plot together better than this entry in the series does, as the plot here doesn't give equal time to each Universal monster. Dracula's plot is the biggest at first, but soon fizzles out only to resurface at the end. The Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never really develops, and is essentially just another version of the plot he always finds himself in. Frankenstein's Monster is given the coldest hand, as he appears in the movie merely as an afterthought, and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. The story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting, but this is a little disappointing as he isn't the reason why people will see this film. The acting is good enough, with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr once again making sure that his character is bathed in tragedy. Glenn Strange is given nothing to do, and Onslow Stevens proves the real highlight as Dr Edelman. Overall, this film won't do much for anyone that isn't a fan of Universal horror; but as silly monster movies go, House of Dracula is worth seeing.",
         "Much of what is written here is useful, but I'd like to add a few comments. Interestingly for Universal horror fans, House of Dracula is the only film in the Frankenstein series that does not star Karloff or Lugosi. The absence of these two horror heavyweights makes the film seem more disjointed than other entries (though still fun.) (John Carradine, I think scores best, while Mr. Chaney, Jr., is merely repeating himself. House of D also introduces a female hunchback!) I wonder if Karloff and Lugosi are both absent because they were working on \"The Body Snatcher,\" which was released the same year and is arguably Karloff's last great horror film.",
         "There has been a debate raging for Universal Monster fans over the decades as to what's the better film -- \"House of Frankenstein\" or \"House of Dracula\"? For me, I may prefer HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, but I certainly wouldn't count out an evening with this one, the final \"serious\" entry in Universal's classic monster series. It's still pretty good, though I feel its main problem is just being a victim of familiarity and nowhere else to really go at this stage. At least \"Frankenstein\" was a fresh idea at the time, while \"Dracula\" repeats the old formula again and reveals that our favorite cherished monsters had reached their limitations. Dracula (John Carradine) arrives at the home of the kindly Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) to seek a cure from his vampirism. At the same time, the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) shows up looking for release from his lycanthropy. Through a series of chaotic events, the warm hearted doctor turns into a Jekyll/Hyde madman and becomes intent on reviving the Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange). Throw in a pretty \"hunchback\" nurse and you've got what the ads curiously touted as \"FIVE Monsters!\" What \"House of Dracula\" has going for it is more of that vintage Universal atmosphere and soothing music soundtrack, and a superb dual performance from Onslow Stevens as the scientist. John Carradine turns in another fine rendition of his suave Count Dracula, but Lon Chaney's werewolf is pretty much by the books at this point, although the end of the movie contains an interesting little twist for a change. Glenn Strange makes a very awesome-looking Frankenstein Monster, but unfortunately spends 99% of the film lying flat on his back with the exception of a few minor shots when he's up on his feet; some of his most active footage is swiped from BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN. All things considered you could undoubtedly do a lot worse than \"House of Dracula\" for a nightly Monster Mash, but it's easy to see why Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster were retired after this chapter, and why they needed Abbott & Costello to resuscitate them three years later. **1/2 out of ****",
         "Baron Latos appears to Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) in the middle of the night and reveals that he's really Count Dracula (John Carradine). He seeks a cure for his vampirism. A trip to the basement shows that Dracula has already taken the liberty of moving in - there's his coffin, filled with the dirt from his own grave. Dr. Edelman takes this brazenness in stride while refusing to believe in the supernatural. Later, Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) shows up, asking for a cure for his lycanthropy. He can't bear to change into a werewolf one more time. Edelman must save Talbot from a suicide attempt when Talbot throws himself into the ocean and gets swept into a cave. While in the cave, Edelman and Talbot find Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange). Edelman decides to revive him, but Talbot and Edelman's hunchbacked female assistant (Jane Adams) talk him out of it. Meanwhile, Edelman's other assistant (Martha O'Driscoll) finds herself seduced by Count Dracula; while Edelman finds the evil count has an even more powerful influence over his own life. Dracula's corruption of Edelman adds a Jekyll-and-Hyde type story to this already over-monstered brew. Why didn't they throw in the Mummy and the Invisible Man for the hell of it? Of all the Universal Horror films that are wacky-idiotic, this is the most entertaining. Stevens is very enjoyable as Edelman; the plot moves fast; a certain character gets his first happy ending; and it's fun to imagine that the real reason Frankenstein's monster is angry is that he sees the movie is almost over and he hasn't even done anything yet.",
         "This is another Universal fun filled fright fest.Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein.Even though it has similar cast and the same director it can stand on its own.(It does appear that Erle C Kenton directed most of the Universal horror films of the 40's). The plot recap:Baron Latos appears at the home of Dr Eidlemann seeking a \"cure\" for his vampirism.Larry Talbot (who somehow survived House OF Frankenstein) also shows up at the good doctors door seeking a cure for his affliction.After a failed suicide attempt Talbot and the doctor find the Frankenstein monster. To complicate matters just before he bites the dust, Dracula infects the good doctor with his blood.The doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times.Where this leads to is something you'll have to see for your self. Carradine actually gives a very good performance as Dracula. He isn't chewing up the scenery as he will in later roles. It is hard to repress giggles when he appears in a top hat though.The cape/cloak is traditional but the hat has to go. Where does the hat go when he changes into a bat...? Onslow Stevens gives an excellent portrayal of the doctor. He's torn between his basic kindness and the increasing blood lust he is now prone to. This is a very underrated performance.Chaney brings even more life to the Wolf Man in his 4th appearance in that role. The monster isn't given much to do this time.Just lay on the table until the end(some stock footage from the Ghost Of Frankenstein is used).At least in House Of Frankenstein he was up and around a bit. Yes this does stick to the basic Universal pattern complete with the angry village mob running amok with torches.But it isn't a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes.It gets a low 8.",
         "This movies marks the final appearance for the famous classic horror characters; Dracula, The Frankenstein creature and The Wolf Man. Well yes, of course those characters would later appear in many other horror movies over the years, in many different forms and ways but this was the last official Universal Pictures horror movie with those classic monsters. Unless you also count \"Bud Abbott Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein\" but since that movie was a comedy I think its fair to say that this movie is the last in the series, that follows the movies; \"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Bride of Frankenstein\", \"Dracula's Daughter\", \"Son of Frankenstein\", \"The Wolf Man\", \"The Ghost of Frankenstein\", \"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man\", \"Son of Dracula\" and \"House of Frankenstein\". Main problem is that the movie lacks any fresh ideas or one good central character. I'm still not sure who was supposed to be the main characters in this movie. It also lacks some good well known actors. Basically the only well known actors from the good old days in this movie are Lon Chaney Jr. and Lionel Atwill. John Carradine once again reprises his role as Dracula and he is surprisingly better than he was in \"House of Frankenstein\". Glenn Strange also reprises his role as the Frankenstein monster once more but he doesn't have an awful lot to do in this movie. Lon Chaney Jr. perhaps plays his best Wolf Man role in this movie and his character gets the most satisfying ending of all the monster characters (Whether he dies or not, or gets cured finally am I not going to spoil for you.). The Wolf Man truly was a tragic character and Chaney Jr. perfectly captures that feeling in this movie. It's too bad that the movie lacks in so many important things; a good story, well known classic horror actors, a good main character and any original moments. Still of course for the fans of the genre, this movie still remains perfectly watchable. 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
         "Riding on the success of 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man', Universal came up with a script 'Wolf Man vs Dracula' that, on paper, was exciting (but no Frankenstein Monster). It included a great sequence toward the end where Dracula, as a giant bat, battles the Wolf Man inside the walls of Castle Dracula (some of that premise survived in the closing scenes of 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein'). And it was violent enough for the censors to raise a fuss that caused delays in re-writes (apparently from the Wolf Man's carnage on half of the village gendarmes at the climax). So it was shelved. Then Karloff returned to Universal Studios from Broadway's roadshow 'Arsenic and Old Lace'; and 'House of Frankenstein' was born. Within the year, the same producer, writer and director were reunited for this follow-up. Chaney, Carrradine and Strange returned for their respected reprisals of the Wolf Man, Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster and were shoved in the background in favor of Onslow Steven's (excellent) portrayal of Dr Edelmann's 'Jekyll/Hyde type' character. And that's part of the problem because the writer(s) apparently felt that they had milked the 3 main Monsters dry, so the emphasis is put back on the (mad) scientist, along with (female) hunchback Jane Adams. But it's still a fun ride! The settings are atmospheric and creepy, the music is appropriate (many themes rehashed from previous entries) and the acting is good considering the same inane dialogue the actors were required to deliver. Unfortunately the powers-to-be made such drastic cuts in the budget that footage from the ending of 'Ghost of Frankenstein' was stolen to fill in the final closing seconds (the original ending, as written, was staged in the catacombs beneath the laboratory, with the floor giving way to engulf Edelmann and the Monster). The only saving grace is that Universal made up for it by concluding the saga with 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein'. Some nice moments makes a good 2nd feature to 'House of Frankenstein'. 5.5 out of 10! I still like it overall!",
         "This creepy sequel to 'House of Frankenstein', has a doctor (Onslow Stevens) trying to revive the monsters (Glenn Strange and Lon Chaney, Jr.) after becoming infected with the blood of Dracula. All the atmospheric effects are present and there's a chilling performance by John Carradine whose gaunt appearance makes him a perfect choice for the Dracula part. The special effects involving his transformation are smoothly handled, as of course are the Wolfman's makeup change under the full moon. By this time, Universal had perfected many of these techniques and the effects are sometimes startlingly realistic. Lionel Atwill has a brief part as the village police chief and Martha O'Driscoll and Jane Adams provide the feminine interest. But the main honors go to Onslow Stevens as the doctor who mistakenly inherits vampire tendencies--a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde role that he does extremely well. A fright film that doesn't disappoint, entertaining all the way."
