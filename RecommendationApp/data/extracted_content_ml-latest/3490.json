Boasting Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing as a twin elegant force that are fighting evil, pic is in safe hands. As the title suggests, story takes place on a train, a Trans-Siberian Express no less. Anthropologist Prof. Sir Alexander Saxton (Lee) has discovered a creature frozen during one of his mountain expeditions, and has it safely locked up during the train journey. Yeah, right! Pretty soon grisly deaths start occurring so Saxton and Dr. Wells (Cushing) must find out what the beast is and how to stop it - if it can be stopped that is...\r\n\r\nIt's a splendid amalgamation of films like And Then There Were None and The Thing from Another World. Although it's often cheap looking, the modest budget actually makes the \"B\" movie roots engage rather than hinder. Telly Savalas' introduction late in the day doesn't make a lot of sense, and he hams it for all he's worth, but again there's a horror charm about it as the blood does flow and eyeballs do pop. While the revelation and modus operandi of the creature, the science aspects of it, contains good thought and doesn't insult the viewers in spite of the nuttiness of it all.\r\n\r\nGreat fun, so go buy a ticket and get on board. 7.5/10 ",

      "synopsis": "Professor Alexander Saxton ( Christopher Lee) is an anthropologist returning home to Europe via the Trans-Siberian Railway. He brings with him a large crate containing the prize from his expedition to the Himilayas: the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature, which Saxton is sure is the missing link in the evolutionary chain. Also on board is Dr. Wells ( Peter Cushing), another Englishman and a colleague of Saxton's. Mysterious deaths occur even before the train sets out. A known thief is found dead on the platform after having looked into the crate. His corpse is discovered bleeding from the eyes, which have turned blank and white. A slightly unbalanced monk named Pujardov (a Rasputin-esque figure, played by the Argentine actor Alberto de Mendoza), claims that the crate is evil. Pujardov is the spiritual adviser for Count Maryan Petrovski ( George Rigaud) and his wife, Irina ( Silvia Tortosa), and he tries to demonstrate to them that the crate is an omen of evil: in a bizarre rationalization, he claims that where there is evil, there is no place for the sign of the cross, and a piece of chalk fails to make the marking of the cross on the side of the crate. Saxton dismisses it as a trick and discredits the monk. Saxton is eager to keep his find a secret from everyone, especially Dr. Wells, but Wells pays the baggage man to look into the crate when everyone is gone and tell him what's inside. Later, the man does this and is also killed by the creature, which possesses a glowing red eye. After gazing at the red eye, the man's eyes begin to bleed and turn white until he falls down dead. The ape-man quickly picks the lock of the crate just like the Chinese thief did back at the beginning of the train's voyage. The creature leaves the crate and places the baggage man's corpse inside instead; the others discover it later and Saxton is forced to come clean about his discovery. Inspector Mirov ( Julio Peña) represents authority on the train, and he tries to keep the news of the death quiet among the passengers, while simultaneously searching for the creature. A beautiful woman insinuates herself into Dr. Wells' compartment; she is Natasha ( Helga Liné), and she uses her feminine charm to convince Wells she is a lady in distress. In reality she is a jewel thief intent on stealing the Countess's jewels from the train's safe. She is recognized by Yevtushenko ( Ángel del Pozo), a prominent engineer who knows he has seen her before. Wells dines with the both of them in the dining car, but Mirov summons him and his assistant, Miss Jones ( Alice Reinheart) to perform an autopsy on the baggage man. When they remove the top of his skull, they find that his brain is strangely smooth; Wells concludes that the brain has somehow been \"drained\" of all knowledge and memory. Later, when he sees a boiled fish with a white eye, he decides that this is the reason the eyes of the victims turn white; the memories and information are absorbed through the eyes, causing this reaction. The fossil continues to haunt the train and kills two guards, eventually overcoming Natasha when she sneaks into the dark baggage compartment and attempts to steal the jewels from the safe. Wells happens upon the murder scene and the fossil tries to attack him, but it is gunned down by Inspector Mirov, who stares at the creature and then collapses into unconsciousness. In an strange experiment, Saxton and Wells discover images embedded in liquid inside the eye of the dead fossil, images that reveal a prehistoric Earth, as well as a view of the Earth from outer space. They deduce that the real threat is a formless alien creature that was simply inhabiting the body of the fossil, and that it has now transferred itself to someone else on board the train. These fears are confirmed when Miss Jones is found dead in the baggage compartment, attacked by the Inspector and drained of her brain, her eyes white and bleeding. The monk senses the evil presence inside of the Inspector and pledges allegiance to it, considering it Satan. Yevtushenko becomes a victim, too, when the creature learns that he has studied the laws of physics and theories of space travel. When news of the murders on the train is wired to Siberian authorities, the train is stopped and an intimidating cossack named Captain Kazan ( Telly Savalas) boards with a small group of his men. Mirov is discovered to be the creature and is shot down, but not before the alien presence transfers itself to the monk. The passengers all retreat to the caboose, while the monk murders Kazan and his men by draining them of their brains. The creature attacks Count Petrovski, who is knowledgeable of the formula for creating steel; the creature intends to escape Earth by building a vehicle using the combined knowledge of the intelligent men it has absorbed. When it threatens the Countess, Saxton arrives and confronts it with a rifle and a powerful light, which renders its deadly red eyes temporarily ineffective. Playing for time, the creature tempts Saxton by revealing that it came to Earth millions of years ago and was accidentally left behind by its own kind; it is a formless energy that has survived over all the years by transferring itself to each form of life that has evolved over time. As such, it possesses all of the knowledge that Saxton so desperately wants. It offers to help him cure disease and end hunger, but Saxton decides that it cannot be left alive. Realizing that Saxton cannot be bargained with, it resurrects all of its victims as white-eyed zombies. The zombies chase Saxton and the Countess back to the caboose, where the others are waiting. As they desperately work to detach the caboose from the rest of the train, Russia sends a telegraph to the next station ahead that they are to send the train over a cliff. The operators follow this order, thinking that they may be at war. Just as the surviving passengers manage to separate themselves from the rest of the train, it goes crashing over the cliff into a fiery explosion below. The caboose rolls to a safe stop precariously near the edge, where the survivors watch the fire consume the train and the unnatural inhabitants within it.",

         "Pardon my enthusiasm but Horror Express really is a must see for all fans of classic horror. It simply is one of the best horror movies made in the seventies and I can't think of many aspects about it that are negative. First of all it stars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. There.that should already be enough as a recommendation. These gentlemen are one THE greatest duo in horror ever and they didn't do their finest work just for Hammer Studio's exclusively. And the fun doesn't stop with these two icons.Horror Express also stars Telly `Kojak' Savalas in a delightful role. It's actually a shame that his screentime is rather limited because he manages to impress as much as Lee and Cushing. He clearly enjoyed playing Captain Kazan and he makes the most of his performance. But Horror Express has a lot more to offer than just good acting. It's a powerful and fascinating story that delivers a good old fashioned amount of scares and atmosphere. The entire story takes place on a old train which is the ideal setting for a film like this. The old and noisy carriages create a unique atmosphere of claustrophobia and the `nowhere to run'-element is used to the max. The plotline itself surprisingly good and it keeps you alert during the entire movie. This is also thanks to the several other, interesting topics that are included in the movie like anthropology, religion and the evolution-theory. Sure, the entire screenplay is illogical and the plot contains as many holes as a small Swiss cheese but - seriously - who cares. I prefer this kind of silly inspiration and creativity a million times over the horror crap they make nowadays !! Horror Express is - simply put - a must see ! I'd even say it's essential viewing if you're looking for the highlights in the genre. It's original, creepy ( even pretty bloody and violent ), it contains enough humor to moderate things and most of all.it's very entertaining. Climb on board and find yourself a seat.Horror Express is one movie you won't regret watching !!",
         "The first halve of this movie is pretty standard seventies horror stuff like featured in most of the old Hammer movies. The second halve however really surprised and impressed me. I loved it! I really love old-horror movies with both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in it. In this movie they are better than ever together. Their acting is superb and so is the rest of the cast even though it is a bit strange that almost all of the Russians are played by Spanish people. Telly Savalas also shows up in a fun role. Savalas is probably best known for portraying Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond movie \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" but he also played in classics like: \"Cape Fear\" (1962), \"Kelly's Heroes\", \"Capricorn One\" and \"The Dirty Dozen\". It's wonderful to see such fine acting in one movie because normally mainly it are just only Cushing and Lee who are the only good actors in a movie like this. Also this movie is actually scary and gory and it has a really good atmosphere. It starts like some kind of monster movie like \"Creature From the Black Lagoon\" but the second halve of the movie is more like a Zombie movie like \"Lifeforce\" (which is an underrated horror classic in my opinion with a great soundtrack). A combination that worked really well for me. The story stays simple and of course ridicules but it still is better than 90% of the other movies from the same genre and it actually goes deeper in trying to explain some of the things. In my opinion a real horror classic! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
         "Picture a frozen ape man discovered by a British archeologist and scientist at the turn of the century, and being placed aboard a Trans-Siberian railway from China to Russia..and you have the beginning of Horror Express. Christopher Lee plays the man who finds this fossil, as he calls it, which turns out to be so much more. The film itself is beautiful as we see this elegant train traveling across snow-covered terrain(actually filmed in Spain). The cast of characters aboard are of equal interest. Peter Cushing plays a scientist named Dr. Wells. For Cushing, this is a fine performance of a scientist less hypnotized by the ethic of science and more worldly. He bribes officials to get train tickets, has a baggage man drill holes in Professor Saxton's(Lee's) discovery, flirts with both his manly lady assistant and a beautiful stow-a-way, and in general seems less serious than many of his former roles. Nice to see him occasionally smile. Lee's professor is quite typical of Lee, burly, officious, obnoxious, and willful. Both Cushing and Lee are extraordinary and sights to behold as they waltz through the script of finding the creature which is wiping the minds of various peoples. The rest of the cast is also very good with a Rasputin-like monk stealing scene after scene. Horror Express is fast-paced action, inventive science fiction, gory thrills, and chilling horror. Indeed it is worth a look!",
         "Judged on its own terms--as a 70s ghoul movie--this film should be rated a 10 out of 10! The plot is well-structured and tightly directed, and contains lots of great elements: 1906 setting, fancy trans-Siberian train ride, a ghoul, a mad monk, alien theorizing a-la-X-files, zombie soldiers stalking, Peter Cushing sawing the top of somebody's head off, a beautiful spy, eyeballs in a dish, a beautiful Polish Countess, and, believe it or not, it's all very cohesive! That's an admirable achievement And the acting is great. The Monk is a scene-stealer. Christopher Lee gets to play a testy, priggish Edwardian scientist, and he does it very well. Cushing's character plays off Lee's stodginess as a laid-back deal-maker(yes, he actually smiles and cracks jokes)These two performances prove that Lee and Cushing were both gifted and versatile actors. Telly Savalas arrives for the final act, and proceeds to strut around and chew up the scenery on a level that would make Rod Steiger or Al Pacino jealous. This movie is one of the best of its type. Yes, in the first two minutes you can see signs of a limited budget, and yes, the microscope scene is ludicrous, but in a way, on the level of imagination and poetic license, it's pure genius. Corrections: a certain \"Dik\" offered this information while commenting: 1. \"An Italian film\".(It's a Spanish/UK production) 2. \"Lee plays an American Scientist\"(the first thing you hear in the movie is Lee saying he is part of the ROYAL Archeological Society, and there's also a lengthy exchange about his character's Englishness: \"Queen Victoria, crumpets, Shakespeare\"...etc.(The commentator actually goes on about how Lee's portrayal of an American reflects how foreigners view Americans. Well...there's a little problem with that idea, isn't there?)",
         "This was a very enjoyable movie. The story--about a body hopping alien loose aboard the trans-Siberian railroad in 1906--is like a dry run for all those X-Files to come, not to mention FALLEN. If you crossed the X-Files with Murder on The Orient Express you'd come close what is on display here. I really wasn't expecting much from this movie and maybe that is why i was so pleasantly surprised. Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee--given a rare chance to play allies instead of enemies--rise to the occasion and deliver spot-on performances that are filled with an infectious wit and good humor. And the incomparable TELLY SAVALAS--in what is really only a glorified cameo--makes the most of his opportunity--arrogantly strutting thru the train swilling vodka and chewing on the scenery with delight.The director shows a real flair for developing an atmosphere of paranoia and fear and the screenplay is, quite simply, completely bonkers! The feverish pacing keeps everything hurtling forward with an hysterical abandon and a fine (if perhaps at the time, unwitting)comic edge. If you are a fan of The X files, Agatha Christie murder mysteries, Brit horror icons Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, or just like movies set in Siberia featuring the dessicated remains of body hopping alien parasites--then HORROR EXPRESS is the film for you! Enjoy!",
         "SPOILERS I've noticed that some people refer to this movie as \"obscure\", which baffles me because I used to watch it all the time on television in the 70s & early 80s, back when it was still fun to watch late-nite TV (before the dawn of the infomercial). For a number of years, all you had to do was turn on the TV after midnight and eventually you'd catch \"Horror Express\". Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing play two \"distinguished gentlemen\" at odds with a nasty frozen \"fossil\" that Chris picked up in the far East and is now taking back to Europe on the Trans-Siberian Express. The fossil, a half man/half ape Neanderthal that he believes may be the missing link, thaws out and becomes surprisingly animated. The creature begins attacking and murdering the passengers, draining them of their brain contents through their eyes, which turn white and bleed. Later, the fossil is shot down and \"killed\", and it's only then that we learn the true threat: a formless, extraterrestrial \"intelligence\" that can inhabit living bodies by entering through the eyes. The \"brain sucking\" allows it to absorb the intelligence of its victim, resulting in a cunning (and seemingly unstoppable) adversary. \"Horror Express\" has got a wonderful European atmosphere to it, in the tradition of the best 70s genre films, and it is a real treat for those who appreciate this kind of thing. Although it's a low-budget Spanish production, it's almost on par with the best of the Hammer productions. The presence of Lee and Cushing might actually make you think it's Hammer, but when Telly Savalas shows up to keep order on the train, you'll know it's not. The sets are weird and appropriately eerie. It's not quite as claustrophobic as a real train might be, the cars look a little too wide and a little too opulent. However, the miniature shots of the train are not all that bad for a low budget film. The movie does manage to be genuinely chilling in some places, especially the climax of the film that gives us an undead army of bleeding, white-eyed victims. Only a few campy sequences hold it back from being a real classic (the textbook drawings that are supposed to pass for real-life images they find in the creature's eyeball, for one). But so little to complain about in a film so delicious. Definitely worth your time, especially late late at night!",
         "A sadly neglected and underrated horror story. Every avid fan of either Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing should see it! Consider the setting; a trainload of passengers on the Transsiberian Express, with no way to go -trapped with a spooky prehistoric monster! It has a feel of low-budget italian productions, but it's not enough to spoil the great atmosphere of this old-fashioned fright night. And how many times do you get to see Cushing and Lee on the same side, battling the same foe? The climax, which resembles a zombie-movie could very well be the scariest in the history of all on-screen train rides!",
         "Horror Express - Ingredients: A missing link unearthed from its icy tomb; an isolated train journey through snow-swept China and Russia; a mad monk; murder; startling discoveries and twists; a dash of comedy. Also add Christopher Lee; Peter Cushing; Telly Savalas. Place into pot and mix well, then prepare for one suspense thrilled journey. You will not be disappointed!",
         "All aboard the Trans-Siberian Express - non stop to the shores of hell. That's the interpretation of the priest character on board. But he's off-base; it's an alien monster that's causing all the trouble - a monster derivative of \"The Thing\" story, but about 10 years before John Carpenter presented his version. The creature is literally millions of years old, having passed through various forms as life evolved on Earth; then someone makes the mistake of storing it on board in a frozen apelike fossil. Next thing you know, certain individuals are behaving strangely, with glowing red eyes, and others turn up dead with eyes whited out (and brains drained). This, of course, benefits from the umpteenth pairing of Lee and Cushing; Lee is the arrogant scientist here and Cushing is again a doctor. Much of the entertaining dialogue stems from the conflict between science and religion, during the transitional phase of the early 20th century. The priest rants on about Satan; Lee calls it rubbish. Here's a typical quote from the priest: 'There's the stench of death on board this train; even the dog knows it.' The dog belongs to a couple of aristocratic Russians on board. At the one hour mark, Savalas shows up as a power-mad Cossack with his soldiers, ready to kick everyone to hell and back. He manages to make quite an impression in the next 15 minutes as the death toll escalates. He and the two leads (British all the way) sort of ham it up, as if knowing they're in some crackerjack cheesy horror material, but there's also quite a bit of eeriness to the proceedings. The filmmakers managed to get the nice train set from an earlier big budget production and made good use of it. The train itself becomes nearly another character, hurtling through the dark with snow and a chill wind all around, and the interior set design is quite good. The musical score is also unusual; when one expects ominous tones during some sequences, instead we get a kind of tuneful melody. But the best thing about this is the concept itself - this thing, this form of energy, having been around forever and theoretically capable of curing all our ills, contents itself with the easy kill. Boy, does it like to drain brains.",
         "An intriguing idea of a \"spirit\" of pure evil with the ability to jump from body to body aboard a trans-siberian train. Well done considering budget constraints, and claustrophobic. Lee and Cushing are fine, but it's Telly Savales who chews the scenery to good effect. He is an unexpected treat as a bullying cossack officer and good counterpoint to Lee and Cushing as civilized gentlemen. Don't expect a slick Hollywood production and you won't be disappointed. I watched this on late night TV spookfests everytime it was on during the late 70s and saw something new each time. It's something like a cross between Hammer and Argento, and a little bit of Corman, too."
