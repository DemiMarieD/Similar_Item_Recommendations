But still as a family adventure film in the veins of the stuff Disney did in the 90's it's most certainly above average.",

         "This movie is visually stunning. In a nutshell this movie is about a father who is a pilot and delivers toilet paper around the Alaskan wilderness. His plane crashes and his kids go out to search for him after being angry at the authorities for not doing enough to find their father. They free a cute little polar bear cub who has been caught by a poacher and the polar bear helps them find their lost father. The storyline isn't anything special and basically we have all seen a movie like this many many times. You know the..'kids go out to rescue mother/father/uncle/grandpa and get into lots of life threatening situations with cute animal in toe, but everything is a just fine and dandy in the end'. Was good to see Dirk Benedict who played Jake Barnes in Alaska, in something as I loved him in The A Team all those years ago. Thora Birch plays the part of Jessie Barnes his daughter and does the kind of acting job that we have come to expect from her... excellent. Vincent Kartheiser plays Sean Barnes the typical anx ridden/angry teenager who comes good and to the aid of his father. If you like visually beautiful movies and don't need them to be intellectual masterpieces, then watch Alaska",
         "This is a wonderful family movie for everyone to enjoy. But I guess I'm kinda biased because I love almost everything Thora Birch is in, and if not I love every single scene of the movie that's terrible she's in. I had seen Thora Birch playing Harrison Ford's daughter in \"Patriot Games\" and enjoyed her work, so I wanted to check her out in this movie and was rather impressed.\"Alaska\" was a great movie I took my cousins to see.I thought Alaska was awesome! Much better than all that mindless wholesome movies starring actresses like Hilary Duff and the Olsen twins anyway. I do believe people under the age of 40 would like it better than others because I was one of the youngest ones in the theater when I watched it. Now that's really saying something. But besides that, it's a really good movie and I may be wrong and everyone may enjoy it! Take the whole family to see it! It's a really great movie! When this film was released I knew it would get criticism, either by the premise of stealing money, or by it's similarities between Gold Diggers:The Secret of Bear Mountain. I do not agree that it is like Gold Diggers, \"Alaska\" is a lot better. It even made me tear up a bit as Jessie and the bear cub's friendship was shown.The movie is about Jessica (Thora Birch-Monkey Trouble, Now and Then) and Sean Barnes (Vincent Kartheiser) who are two kids living in Alaska with their dad Jake (Dirk Benidict) who flies supplies to small towns in the wilderness. On one of his flights, Jake encounters bad weather and his plane ends up crashing into a mountain side. Frustrated by unsuccessful rescue attempts, Jessie and Sean set out on their own to find their dad whose wrecked plane hangs from the edge of a mountain peak. Along the way the kids encounter Collin Perry (Charlton Heston) and Mr. Koontz (Buck Fraiser), two poachers who've just killed a mother polar bear and taken its cub to sell overseas. The kids free the bear, which they nickname `Cubby,\" and it follows them for the rest of their journey. Of course the poachers want their bear cub back so they follow the kids hoping to get Cubby. From then on, the kids must deal with the poachers, as well as the dangerous Alaskan landscape, as they make their way to rescue their dad. This movie had some really neat climbing sequences, good action, spectacular scenery but it lacked a few laughs. Fraser Clarke Heston manages the climbing scenes well, and the film has some pretty odd moments.Thora Birch is great and gorgeous, she gives a good performance, and her dad and brother are also good.The poachers are a bit one dimensional, but it doesn't really matter to the kids, which is the audience most likely to be attracted to this movie. When seeing this with your kids and that it's just a movie. Don't let them take it too seriously, but hey, they're kids. With so many children's movies about kid's bank heists and a whole lot of action, wholesome family movies starring teen queens traveling to some foreign place, this movie is, not to sound cliche, a complete breath of fresh air, educational, good acting. 7/10.",
         "Watched this on TV because I really wanted to see Thora Birch acting at 14. SPOILERS follow (but nothing you won't work out for yourself five minutes into the movie). There's lots of nice scenery, and some decent animal training, but it's poor for lots of reasons \u0096 it views like silly cutesy kids schmaltz, maybe because that's what it is. Birch is good \u0096 not as dazzling as she is today, but you can see it coming. Charlton Heston has always been a fine actor and a great star and, in a feeble role as a comedy heavy, gives an acting masterclass to everyone around him. There's one ghastly vomit-inducing moment which shows how lightly some of these hack movie-makers regard the characters they've created. OK, setup: Dad's a pilot who's just taken a job in Alaska, daughter Birch loves the outdoor life up there, slightly older son hates it, wants back to Chicago and never stops moaning. As soon as Dad's plane goes down, we know the rescue services are going to fail, the kids will have to get the job done, and the whole point of all this will be to get son reconciled with Dad. Setting off, all is sensible enough. The girl knows how to kayak, the boy doesn't, so he screws up, complains about aches and pains etc. And we carry on more or less like this (trying to ignore the comedy poachers and the cutesy baby polar bear). The girl's strong, resolute, sensible and resourceful, the boy's initially hopeless, but toughens up fast into a worthwhile companion. And then comes this moment. I wondered what was going on when, after they've both carried big rucksacks all the way, suddenly, for no reason, hers is gone. Just a continuity error? \u0096 I wish. They're climbing this mountain, the kind of thing they've been doing for days, when out of nowhere (and right out of character) girl suddenly whines: 'I can't climb any more. I'm tired,' setting up boy's macho return: 'Come on, I'll carry you if I have to.' The boy has to be transformed from incompetent wimp to tough-guy hero, the tough-guy needs a feeble girl to look after, and if we have to sacrifice the brave strong character we created earlier \u0096 hey, she's only a girl, after all, right? Don't pay to rent this, but if you see it on TV \u0096 did I mention it's got Thora Birch?",
         "If it were only for the splendid and breathtaking scenery i would still recommend this movie. However this film also delivers on the emotional level and follows a journey of transformation as beautiful as the visual aspects. A single father apts for a change after losing his wife by moving to Alaska with his two children to become a bush pilot. His son is resentful at best, ungrateful, and unappreciative of the vast and stunning riches Alaska has to offer. When their father's plane goes down and rescue efforts fail, they begin a spiritual journey that will forever change their lives. The son, Shawn, played by Vincent Karthieser, soon comes to terms with the death of his mother, the love for his father, and the respect and appreciation for Alaska. Thora Birch, an actress with a promising future, provides the level-headed and sensible approach to the journey in contrast to her brother's cockiness and arrogance which provides for great chemistry between the two. Along with the natural beauty and landscapes just about every other aspect associated with Alaska is present from: poaching, bushpilots, kayaking, rustic cabins, rock climbing,, moutaineering, camping, and the northern lights along with Cubby, a baby polar bear who tags along and even provides for some tear jerking moments and light hearted humor. Overall this is a great movie for the entire family or for one with a fascination with the wonders and beauty of the last frontier. It truly evokes a sense of appreciation delivered in a manner without the concept of strong language, violence, and nudity, the three marketing schemes of the industry. It is a fantastic adventure, with great camera angles, stunning visuals and a powerful message. Very well done IMHO.",
         "A family movie that is worth your time. The scenery alone is worth viewing. The shear beauty of the mountains and Lakes is deftly filmed. Also interesting to see Charlton Heston in one of his few heavy roles during a long career. The cast did a very creditable job on this movie. I rated this movie 7.",
         "I think it is safe to say that this film will appeal far more to a young child as opposed to an adult but if you're in a good mood and feel like sitting down and not taxing your brain, then this is the film for you. Dirk Benedict of The A-Team plays the father of two young children who go out to rescue him after his plane crashes in the icy wilderness of Alaska. As is inevitable, they encounter the usual adventures kids have when wandering alone in the wild. Charlton Heston is the token bad guy who is out to poach a cuddly little polar bear. Polar bears are the last animal you would expect to be so cuddly and if you cuddled one in real life, you probably wouldn't get up again but it's hard not to find the bear adorable. All in all, a great film with the lovely Alaskan scenery and a cuddly polar bear. Check it out.",
         "Though I enjoyed certain components of this movie, being a former resident of Alaska, having lived in Skagway, Ketchican, Palmer, Wasilla, Anchorage, Soldotna, Kenai, Homer, Kodiak, and even Nome, and I think people should know that this movie wasn'nt filmed in Alaska, but British Columbia, which also rivals Alaska in beauty and wildlife. Also Polar bears do not venture much further south then Nome and never, I mean never make it to the panhandle. There is a disputed photograph, on record, of a dead polar bear on an ice floe, that drifted south, but it is argued that the bear wandered onto an ice floe, died, and then drifted south. Any way the movie \"Alaska\" does have enough authentic visuals, in the background to give a viewer some idea of the majesty of Alaska. The story does have many loopholes, of a technical nature, example is the father's plane, precariously lodged at such an elevation, would have caused hypothermia and an inevitable death. Alaskan's have a saying, it goes like this, \"Alaska does not forgive mistakes\". Alaska is very beautiful, however it is very dangerous and the movie \"Alaska\" does not convey that reality. If you would like to see a movie that convey's what kinds of people go to and populate Alaska see the movie \"Leaving Normal\". However there is yet to be movie filmed in Alaska that captures the real Alaska. Why? I don't know.",
         "This film brings back memories from the first movie i watched, \"Tundra\" from 1936. It had the same elements: A post pilot crashing on the tundra, getting lost, finds a pal, a small bear who had lost track of its parents. It was a very touching story, and exiting. But thanks to Hollywood - it all worked out well in a happy ending! When I now watch \"ALASKA,it seems to be based on the same \"TUNDRA\". I have not seen any referance to it in the credits, but hoped that someone out there who also have seen \"TUNDRA\" could help to solve my \"mystery\".",
         "Loved the cinematography. Good character development... believable acting, good casting... overall a pleasant film the whole family watch. It's refreshing to see a well made film that doesn't use un-necessary violence, sex or profanity. Hats off to the whole team! Definitely recommend this film for family viewing. And to top it off there is a wonderful underlying message of hope and core family values... a message we all could stand to see and hear. Entertaining, exciting storyline.",
         "Hard to figure the negative comments about this film. It is geared to an elementary school audience who will find it very entertaining. But it is also good family viewing because the scenery is terrific and the polar bear cub is very cute. Since there was never a conspiracy to keep the demographic identity of the target audience a national secret, those complaining about its lack of sophistication were just too lazy to check it out before actually viewing it. The film delivers exactly what it promises so there is no real basis for that kind of criticism. The editing is first class; especially on the canoe down the rapids sequence where the second unit stuff is perfectly cut into tight shots of the two stars. Thora Birch turns in another excellent performance and Vincent Kartheiser shows that even before \"Angel\" he modeled his acting on William Shatner (this is not a complement). There are a number of plot holes but nothing that really matters. One interesting thing is the scene where the bear cub helps in the rescue effort by pulling the rope with his teeth. Seldom can you point to a \"single\" stupid detail that drastically dumbs down a film but that is the case here. Lose that one moronic shot and the film gains about 20 IQ points and could add a couple years to its target audience."
