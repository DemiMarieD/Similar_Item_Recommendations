         "Blake Edwards once again turned to his bread-and-butter genre, and kept things nice and simple. However, for whatever reason, this downplayed treat was and is often panned by critics left and right. I submit to you that this is because most of us just don't get it. I'll use the plot portent to tell you what this movie isn't, first of all. Despite appearances, it's not about up-and-coming, wannabe yuppie Walter Davis (Bruce Willis), not really about his blind date of the title with the beautiful and potentially deadly Nadia Gates (Kim Basinger), not about psychotic defense lawyer and jealous ex David Bedford's (John Laroquette) attempts to break the two up and steal back his first love, and not about the punches and rolls with which these people, along with their families and acquaintances, must deal. It's just my theory, but I think most of us didn't get this movie because it was a humorous commentary on the time during which it was made. This movie is all about the '80s; the yuppie culture, the self-absorption, the repeated attempts of folks to find solace in getting and having things, and our near-tragic couple's struggle to be who they are, even if it doesn't fit with '80s yuppie culture, and embrace what's important. Consider it--during her drunken binge, Nadia assaults everything that could make Walter a yuppie as if it were a well-organized plan. Walter, in turn, tries his hand at the same thing, mostly upon David and car salesman brother Ted (late, great Phil Hartman). Sure the details give a chuckle or two, but there's an almost cerebral humor going on under the surface of the film, right at the core, which pokes fun at a cornerstone of life in the '80s. This led to the movie's downfall in favor, since the very people at which the movie so heavily pokes fun were probably among the first ones to see it premiere in the '80s. Even if they got it, they probably didn't appreciate the joke. Essemtially, Edwards had spoofed the '80s DURING the '80s. A gutsy move, and witting or unwitting, this gave it a kind of staying power. It really is about more than you think. So, if you're one of the lonely soldiers who likes the movie, try to view it in this context and see what you think of it. If you hated it, please try to observe this point of view, and again, see what you think. Blind Date is one of the most different comedies to emerge from this decade. No matter where you sit on the quality issue, perhaps it deserves a second look.",
         "I love this film. This was Bruce Willis' first box office film. It's a nice little film that has its funny moments. Blind Date is not Citizen Kane, but it's sure a good film to watch on a day off. When Kim Basinger gets drunk, that's where the funny moments start. She goes from being a sweet southern belle to the date from hell. She embarrasses him at a business dinner, goes ga-ga at a club, gets his car lifted, and drives him to the point of insanity. Meanwhile, ex-boyfriend Larroquette is stalking them around the town driving them nuts. His character is given much depth, but he works with it. All in all, it's a funny, innocent film that will make you laugh.",
         "Bruce Willis plays a workaholic Walter Davis, whose brother Ted (Phil Hartman) sets him up with this gorgeous woman Nadia Gates (Kim Basinger).There's one thing about Nadia you should know, though.If she has even a little bit of alcohol, she loses control and becomes wild. The legendary director Blake Edwards directed Blind Date in 1987.It has a brilliant cast.Bruce and Kim shine together at the time they were both oh so young.Bruce turned 50 on Saturday and you could say he now has the legend value.In this movie he takes the lead for the first time. The next year, in 1988, he had an action classic called Die Hard coming. Next year there should be coming Die Hard 4.0, so can't wait to see that.Other actors do a great job too.There are John Larroquette as David Bedford, Nadia's ex, who's doing an excellent job and William Daniels, who's known as the voice of KITT in Knight Rider and George Feeny in Boy Meets World is marvelous.Phil Hartman, who is sadly gone now after his wife shot him in 1998, is wonderful.There certainly is a cast to remember.I remember the first time I saw this movie back in 1994.I was the biggest Bruce Willis fan at the time and I enjoyed this movie very much.These days it doesn't work quite as good, but it's still pretty enjoyable flick.It offers some great comedic moments that bring a grin on your face.",
         "I've always loved Blake Edwards films and although this may not have been regarded as his best work, I feel it was highly underrated. Though thoroughly implausible in many ways, I have to say that this movie made me laugh harder than any movie I've ever seen. My sides literally hurt after watching it. Although I've only seen it a few times since it came out because none of the networks other than FX ever show it. Why I don't know because it's really great!! The main reason I'd have to say was John Laroquette as Nadia's psychotic ex-boyfriend. I was cracking up in every single scene he was in with his standard line (I'll kill you). His physical comedy is totally brilliant. I don't know why he didn't end up with a film career of his own. But my favorite scene has to be at the end when Nadia sees David hanging from the balcony of the house and squeals as they both dive into the pool and meet at the bottom in a kiss as they come up for air, with David yelling; \"Nadia, get your mouth off of him\"!! The movie is flawed in places though. What are the odds that a house moving company would be moving a house at the exact moment that Nadia decides to knock on the door. And it is never explained why Walter is facing 2 years in prison for his night on the town, yet David completely escapes any legal obligations for plowing his car into 3 seperate businesses. Kim Basinger and Bruce Willis were great as well. Though I didn't understand why they dyed her gorgeous blonde hair brown. Maybe because her image was supposed to be that of a sweet girl looking for love and Edwards thought she'd look too much the vamp and would lack credibility without the dye job. It's also a good chance to see the late Phil Hartman early in his career. I also loved the love song played at the end by Gary Morris and Jennifer Warnes. All in all, a fun ride from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it yet, go out and rent it now. You won't be disapointed, it's a 10+++!",
         "I saw this film when it first came out and I laughed out loud at quite a few scenes and thoroughly enjoyed it. Both Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger are excellent and there was obvious comic chemistry between them. There also plenty of great lines and performances from the supporting cast too, especially from John Larroquette (Basinger's psychotically obsessed erstwhile boyfriend). It was a complete mystery to me why it was so panned on release, but reading some of the comments here I am glad to see that this minor gem is finally getting the recognition it deserves. All I'll add is: dobermans, golf balls, moonwalking and an abject lesson in why you should never get your new girlfriend drunk.",
         "One of my favorite 80's comedies. Many very funny and memorable scenes. It's a fun, light-hearted film about a blind date gone awry. Of course, everything that can happen DOES happen on this particular date, and many laughs are the result. The best scene is when Walter and Nadia go to a restaurant after Nadia has had too much to drink. Apparently, she has some sort of chemical imbalance to liquor, and things go haywire in front of Walter's business associates.",
         "I don't know what everyone is talking about. I've seen this movie many times and have it in my collection. I think it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen many. I think the movie moves along just fine, the characters are believable, the story is believable, and every actor does better than their best. The casting was perfect. The cinematography, set design, and all other aspects were good too. It was directed superbly as well. And why not, since it was directed by a master of comedy. I love it, and intend to see it many more times. :)",
         "Blake Edwards, one of the masters of slapstick, once again seems to indicate that he has had his day with this inconsistent, weak story about a corporate exec. who goes on a blind date from hell with an uncontrollable but gorgeous young woman. You see Nadia is fine until she gets a hold of any form of alcohol, and needless to say, Walter Davis (Bruce Willis) allows this to happen despite all the warnings. Absolute pandemonium immediately breaks out, but sadly absolute hilarity does not. Most of the humour based around this premise doesn't work because it's too predictable, over the top and because the two lead characters are so frustratingly stupid. In fact the funniest scenes belong to John Laroquette as an obsessive lawyer and William Daniels as his county court judge father who would like nothing better than to see his son practising law in an entirely different state, or even country. The two play off each other well and create some truly comic moments. Screenwriter Dale Launer's idea was good and it's unfortunate that it turned out to be a one joke film, with a reasonable sub-plot that probably saved the whole thing from oblivion. Funny man Bruce Willis is okay, but stick to the \"Moonlighting\" series for his best. Kim Basinger may be a looker, but she's not much more, while for Blake Edwards fans its back to the \"Pink Panther\" series and Peter Sellers. Friday, August 26, 1994 - Video",
         "An enjoyable piece of fluff, built solely around the notion that Kim Basinger has some kind of metabolic disorder that renders her a reckless drunk if she takes the slightest bit of alcohol. Workaholic Bruce Willis is talked into taking her to dinner at a fancy French restaurant in LA but has underestimated the magnitude of her problem and sees to it that she has a bit of champagne. What follows is an amusing concoction of slapstick, insane dialog, embarrassing situations, and character development in which Bruce Willis turns from a pragmatist into a Dionysian fool. These are well-off people we're talking about. They live in the kind of Southern California milieu in which everyone is expected to have a swimming pool. I counted eight people who were pushed, fell, or were forced to dive into one of the pools to escape a a dog. The hedges are all perfectly barbered, the grass neatly trimmed, the interiors impeccable, and the acreage infinite, all rather like my place. The comedy is usually slapstick. People fall off balconies, ladders, and, in one case, a tree after being hit accidentally on the head with a golf ball. One running gag is effective by any measure. John Larroquette, as Basinger's jealous lover, follows the couple in his car and when his attention is distracted, which it is, three times, his car leaves the road and invariably smashes through a plate glass window -- once a paint shop, once a pet store, and I forget the third. Each time he picks up souvenirs of his accident until he finds himself speeding along in a battered, paint-splashed car, his own clothes and face varicolored, and being blinded from behind by some kind of chirping primate. And this is a man who, though a lecher, is rich and dignified. The burlesque alternates with less frenzied moments, and the dialog is sometimes funny. Larroquette is a lawyer who has decided to defend Willis in court. His very presence draws an angry comment from the judge, William Daniels, who is perfect in the role. \"I hoped never to see you in this courtroom again,\" snarls the judge. Larroquette approaches the judge and smoothly blackmails him into letting the defendant go, while he himself promises never to practice in the judge's jurisdiction again. Daniels scowls, ponders the proposition, then finally agrees, because the prospect of getting rid of Larroquette is simply too bright for him to resist. With a smile, the lawyer leans across the bench and says earnestly, \"Thanks, Dad.\" There are some weaknesses too. On those few sips of wine, Basinger stays drunk for a long time, and when she sobers up and wants to go home, the crazed Willis drags her to another party, which he invades. There he swills down booze, gets loaded, and jiggles matzoh balls while insulting the guests. Drunks -- seriatim. And of course not all the gags succeed. But when they do, they can be subtle as well as obvious. \"Get on with the wedding,\" Daniels orders, \"and kill the dog.\" The minister begins his intonations while, off screen, a distant gunshot is heard. Blake Edwards is adept at handling comedies. Sometime's he's made something out of virtually nothing, as in \"The Party.\" He does pretty well by this script.",
         "I agree completely with TVGirl's review. This is a really funny movie with a first-rate cast, from top to bottom. Bruce Willis, Kim Basinger, John Laroquette, and William Daniels couldn't be better; there is a bonus appearance by Graham Stark, who played the flunky policeman in the Pink Panther movies, and there is not one dud performance or moment. It is fast-paced, imaginative, and just really funny. It doesn't rely on graphic sex or a gross or smutty script filled with smutty language (or that hack Robin Williams) to make you laugh. I can hardly believe this is a Hollywood production, it's so all-round classy. I caught this on cable not long after its release in 1987-88, so it was not a big box-office hit. Probably because the critics whizzed all over it (see my above remarks about \"graphic sex,\" \"gross,\" and \"smutty\") -- pretentious critics apparently only like graphic, gross, and smutty in their comedies. This is on my personal list of \"perfect\" movies and is in my personal collection. Every time I introduce someone to it, they can't believe how funny it is -- usually because they haven't heard of it."
