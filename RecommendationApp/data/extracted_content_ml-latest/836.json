         "content": "Considering that this film was directed by Andrew Davis who before this directed the hit film the Fugitive (1993), you would have thought he ought to put a lot of effort to making Chain Reaction to be just as great as the Fugitive. Unfortunately Chain Reaction just comes off as being a very plain mediocre film. When I originally first saw this film I had no clue what it was about but now since seeing it with a better perspective I now know what it's about, I suppose the story in this does work well but this film does have it's problems, I'm not saying this film is bad as it's watchable but it's very plain.\r\n\r\nThe first problem in this film that comes to my mind is the music soundtrack, oh my gosh, talk about the wrong type of music for your film. Having the right music for your film is extremely important and the people that were behind the films musical design got it all completely wrong. In hindsight this is a chase film where the hero is wrongly accused of something he didn't do and is being chased by the police, but the scenes themselves are just \"plain\" and could have been better. I know I keep using the word plain but when I say this I don't mean it in a bad way, like I said the story does work well.\r\n\r\nOverall conclusion, it's a mediocre action film that's not bad but it's it's just...well...plain.",

         "Actually, the above poster is incorrect. Reeves is a machinist in this movie who is helping the scientists build the parts not a scientist. And that matters in this movie because Reeves actually does pretty well for once as an actor. The concept of the movie isn't a new one, an industrial-military conspiracy to control technology because the masses aren't \"ready\" to deal with it yet. Freeman actually played the most interesting character. He kind of flip-flops throughout the movie and you're not sure what to think of him until the final scene. Regardless, it wasn't the best movie nor the worst movie ever made. Reeves acted pretty well and the writing was semi-believable. If you're looking for a fast paced movie that you don't have to think too much on - this movie isn't a bad rental to see.",
         "Eddie (Keanu Reeves) works on a scientific team that is searching for low-cost energy sources that are good for the environment, too. One day, it seems that such a discovery has been made. Soon after, however, the chief scientist is murdered and the invention stolen. Eddie and fellow team member Dr. Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz) are suspects in the murder and are forced to go on the run. Naturally, the police and the FBI are in hot pursuit. Another team member Paul (Morgan Freeman) may have some secrets to hide as well. Will the truth come out and will the fleeing duo be captured? This movie is mostly a chase picture and a moderately successful one. Much of the action is centered on the capture of Eddie and Lily. There is an impressive scene, for example, where Eddie is trying to avoid seizure by climbing a raised bridge. Unfortunately, not all of the scenes are as effective. The scientific elements are quickly rushed over, causing some confusion as to what has transpired. As for the romance between Reeves and Weisz, it is nicely subdued. It's there but only manifests itself in a few embraces. Although the ending is quite exciting, the overall effect of the movie as an action flick is only partly realized. There are some missing plot elements that would have raised it to a higher level. Recommended as a fairly good action motion picture; Reeves fans, certainly, will enjoy it.",
         "After viewing this film on homevideo,i decided for myself that this fugitive style film was worth adding into my personal collection of fun films.All action nuts should get a kick out of chain reaction mainly because this is what the film was made for and not to be correct in all of what goes on.Keanu reaves is a student machinist at a chicago university who is working with a genius of a professor that is finding a way to extract energy from plain water thru process of hydrogen.Keanu finds the frequency that makes the process work by mistake one night at home.After having a small celebration back at the university,he escorts his tipsy assistant Rachel Weise back to her apartment,but like the gentleman he is,he dosent take advantage of her and puts her to bed.Once he returns back to the building where the experiments were conducted,he finds utter chaos with the professor dead(suffocated) and the hydrogen machine going haywire.He finds a explosive device ready to go off at any minute,so keanu bolts away and heads for his motocycle.After only getting a few miles away,the bomb is detonated and takes out five city blocks in the process.Naturally,since he was the last one at the scene,Keanu is the prime suspect in the sabotage case.His only allies are now Rachel Weise and the mysterious business man portrayed by Morgan Freeman who no one can figure out which side he is really on Purist and filmstudents could pick this film apart as they usually do by noting a few continuity glitches and questioning how keanu could survive the explosion that took out five city blocks,but if he were to perish then and there folks,there could be no further development and the film ends there.Keep in mind this was made for the action buff and you wont mind the few glitches that occur in this film which i deem quite enjoyable by all but the picky few who dont really watch films for enjoyment and escapism.",
         "Has the same improbability clause of other flicks in the same genre. Notwithstanding, Chain Reaction has excellent lighting and set design. There is overall a strong dependency on team acting and multiple scene rotations. This gives the film a docu-drama effect in the beginning. The fast paced scenes may obscure the plot for some. For me the cinemagraphic effects and acting are A-1. Obviously the writing and direction are good, or this film would not hold together at all, and it does. Because there is little character development, the focus is on scene development and approaching plot. This sort of editing technique and direction does not happen by chance and must be recognized as a valid concept. Most certainly a film with character and merit which can be enjoyed by those looking beyond a breadcrumb plot and a gingerbread house script. Good music score (odd, but good) with good sound effects. Forget the trailer, which has little or no correspondence to the film itself, or maybe it does. This is a rather strange film where one has to believe a group of people with unique ideas came together and produced a rather odd film with value. I enjoyed it.",
         "\"Man and woman against the world!!\" Okay, maybe it has been done into the ground, and it is the basis of today's and yesterday's rehashed thriller. The welcome difference that \"Chain Reaction\" gives is in its cast. Morgan Freeman, Keanu Reeves (who's at his best in action) and Rachel Weisz make this film much more engaging to watch than it should be. Reeves and Weisz look fine together as Eddie and Lily, respectively, who are two college students accused of murdering one of their colleagues and stealing their economically and ecologically-friendly fuel project. They must run from the Law AND those who have framed them, or are they the same people? Good on action!",
         "Steeped in the Directorial sensibilities of the 90's Chain Reaction is a well made movie with an intriguing plot and appealing storyline. The movie basically epitomises the life and breadth of all the action thrillers produced in the 90's. I loved them all. Unlike their 21st century counterparts , they don't excel in realism or cold and brutal portrayal of duels . But their is something which qualifies them as entertainers .Chain Reaction is that 90's movie. Keannu Reeves and Morgan Freeman play their parts in this nicely directed film. Tenacious henchmen with the bad guy look written all over their faces, the cool and foxy villain with a suave demeanour, the unassuming,raw , innocent yet determined good guys , an impending disaster involving a \" Chain Reaction\" and more than a 100 hours of proper 90's entertainment.",
         "Keanu Reeves is a machinist working on an experimental project for clean renewable energy when all goes horribly wrong. There is a big explosion, people die and suddenly he and Rachael Weisz get framed for it all and find themselves the most wanted fugitives in America, and so the chase begins... Did someone say fugitive? Hmm.. yes I kept getting flashbacks form \"The Fugitive\" when watching this. Not surprising as the similarities are startling when compared. The same Director, the same basic premise(ie. someone innocent getting framed, running away from law enforcement, uncovering the truth ext.), a number of plot points that coincide, several supporting cast members(bit roles mostly)are the same. This is in essence \"The Fugitive\" remade with a sci-fi twist. The character of Dr. Lily Sinclair played by Rachael Weisz seems to serve little purpose other that a stray puppy for Keanu Reeves' character to look after. Now don't get me wrong - I love Rachel Weisz, her character here was just a little wooden. Almost an agitator character if you will, giving Keanu the motivation to advance the story. Flimsy but functional writing. Morgan Freeman gives his now trademark \"I know more than you do, and you know it\" performance as the mysterious benefactor who clearly has his own agenda. Nothing wrong with this film, at least nothing critical, but it wont be at the top of too many must have lists. So yes this movie does what it was meant to do : entertain you for just shy of 2 hours. Keanu Fans will enjoy it as should fans of the general chase movie genre, with a bit of (questionable)sci-fi thrown in for good measure.",
         "This film is fast and exciting. The story is about a scientist working at a University lab. to make renewable energy out of water. Upon succeeding, the plant explodes but not before Reeves returns to find one of the top researches suffocated. Upon investigation Reeves and Weiss are set up and the FBI are on their case. In seeking to find the truth, they uncover an undercover agency established by the Government that is so secret that top Officials at the White House are unaware of its activities, the FBI are unaware and the is no paperwork of its existence. This film really gets you hooked and makes you think about what does really go on in the world.",
         "Simply put, one of my favorite movies of the 90s, because I'm a big fan of the Fugitive. This plot follows it adds a bit of a new age spin on it. Enjoyable flick with very good actors and a cast that features Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Fred Ward, Brian Cox, Rachel Weisz and many others, highly recommended if you're a fan of the Fugitive or U.S. Marshalls! The story is about a chemist & his friend suspected of murdering their mentor and Reeves & Weisz receive help from a friend of their fallen colleague and they try and find out who is trying to frame them for murder. Much like The Fugitive, which ironically is done by most of the same crew and features some of the actors from that film, it's a great flick to pass the time on.",
         "My Take: A formulaic action movie with some impressive set pieces marred by lackluster writing. Student machinist Keanu Reeves is framed for murder and sabotage of a research laboratory he works in, and is forced to run for his life while trying to prove his innocence. This is not another sequel to THE FUGITIVE, it's actually CHAIN REACTION; a techno chase-thriller from director Andrew Davis, who also directed THE FUGITIVE. Like in that superior film, Davis displays his skills at staging perfectly exciting yet quite plausible action sequences. Unfortunately, the script this time is built around the action, rather than vice versa. The film's plot, about the discovery of water as a main component for creating a cheaper source of energy, is almost abandoned for most of the film in favor of a fairly ordinary chase thriller that has Reeves running from the FBI after being suspected for sabotage, being the only person alive after the explosion of the lab. And boy does he run! The chase moves from jumping from a bridge to chases in snowmobiles or helicopters. In fairness, Davis stages action very well and the stunts here are just what we expect from the man who perfectly staged the train wreck scene in THE FUGITIVE. Unfortunately, the movie stops being thrilling when it becomes a bit too predictable and rather pointless. It's just one chase after another as Reeves and companion Rachel Weisz dodges the feds for 107 minutes until they unmask the true saboteur (which, I suspect, the audience may have already found out halfway). Morgan Freeman is pretty good in a role that demands more of him, and Reeves is once again more impressive in the action rather than in the acting. But unlike in other movies like SPEED, Reeves fails to even display charisma or exhibit any chemistry with his female co-star Weisz (or is it because their characters really just doesn't have enough time to connect?). And when it all finally comes to a close, it didn't feel quite like the end of a movie but the end of a really long chase (of chase). As cinematic junk food goes, CHAIN REACTION is harmless and watchable, but even other mindless action movies have more meat than this. Rating: **1/2 out of 5."
