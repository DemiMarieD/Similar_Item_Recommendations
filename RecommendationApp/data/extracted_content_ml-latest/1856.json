         "Is it objective? No. Is it informative? Yes. Is is accurate? Only as accurate as those talked to. Is it an interesting film? Without a doubt. This should have been called \"Trying To Make 'Kurt & Courtney\", because he never succeeds in making a decent look at their relationship but rather an intriguing look at his struggle to get the whole thing off the ground. He ran into a lot of trouble via Courtney Love and of course threw in his feelings toward her quite obviously in the film. Fans of Kurt may respect it, fans of Courtney are likely to despise it. I admit I am more a fan of Kurt than I could ever be of Courtney, he just seems a hell of a lot more real to me and she has scared me, long before this film made, with all the image make-overs and lame self-promoting publicity stunts. So I had no problem watching her get ripped into in this documentary. But a warning to hardcore HOLE fans, you may get extremely frustrated! Like it or hate it, it won't bore you!",
         "....waiting to see if Ms Courtney punches out director/interviewer Nick Broomfield. Whether or not there is any truth to the vague rumours that the Queen of Grunge killed the King, Kurt and Courtney is a riveting exercise in docu-propaganda. Broomfield doesn't do a good job of hiding his disdain for Courtney, but neither does anyone else on screen. Father Hank Harrison hates her, ex boyfriends hate her, Kurt's friends think she was the master manipulator...and El Duce (killed one short month after the interview in this film by a passing freight train!!) says she offered him money to kill Kurt. Why? Who knows. The only well adjusted person in this film is Kurt's aunt, and she thinks it was suicide. Whatever your personal feelings, this is a fascinating film.",
         "I heard somewhere that Courtney Love tried like the dickens to get this little documentary banned. If there is no truth to it, why would she care so much? Makes you think... Nick Bloomfield interviews people a courtroom wouldn't consider reliable witnesses- El Duce, for one- a singer who was one bizarre addict himself. He claims Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Looking at this guy, you automatically rely on his testimony like your local weather report. Still, it is very interesting that weeks after this interview, El Duce was found dead on the railroad tracks by his home. An investigor who was at Cobain's \"suicide\" scene claims Cobain had way too much heroin in his system to be coherent enough to pull a trigger on himself with any accuracy. Cobain's Aunt claims the whole conspiracy theory is a load of bunk, and she feels Kurt had suicidal tendencies as well as addictions. Yet most of the people interviewed agree that Courtney was a vindictive slag, jealous of Cobain's success and tried to hitch her wagon to Nirvana's rising star (memories of Courtney and Kurt on the cover of the now defunked \"Sassy\" magazine, with Courtney trying to portray herself has the Nancy Spungen of the '90's comes to mind). I've never been a big Love or \"Hole\" fan, mainly because I don't think Love is that talented a musician or singer. I feel she has what they call \"delusions of grandure\", which is why this documentary, for as shaky as the evidence presented is, makes me wonder if it isn't the naked truth.",
         "Not being particularly interested in either Kurt or Courtney, I was surprised how director Nick Broomfield managed to attract me to his film. His unique style gets us involved with the story that no one really knows where it's going. Not even the director himself. This may prove frustrating to those who have become accustomed to polished and hollywoodized type of film making, or those who are looking for a clear \"angle\". To me however, it was a wonderful gallery of many slices of real life: from director's own challenges to one of the best documentary film endings I've ever seen. Hats off to Nick Broomfield for his uncompromising style and bravery.",
         "Nick Broomfield tries to clarify that absurd theory that says that Kurt Cobain was murdered. No one would actually believe that Kurt was killed because it is quite clear that his addiction and his depression killed him. Anyway, Broomfield lets everyone to make their point, all those that defend the conspiration theory. But let me tell you, some of them, just like Courtney Love's father or that grotesque guy called The Duce are not reliable sources precisely. Maybe Nick goes too far accusing Courtney. I mean, she's not Mother Theresa, but she isn't the root of all evil either. She's nothing but an arrogant and eccentric rockstar... just like most of people there in Hollywood. Otherwise, \"Who killed Kurt...?\" has valious moments for all the fans of Kurt: early recordings, interviews with some of his relatives and childhood friends... *My rate: 6/10",
         "About halfway through this \"documentary\" I suddenly realized that the film may, in fact, have been a \"mockumentary\". Consider the following: * The director/interviewer kept saying to the audience \"I wanted to play such-and-such a song by Kurt/Nirvana, but the record label wouldn't give me permission, so here is another song by some band you've never heard of\" * The complete ineptitude of the celebrity stalkers, whose digital camera runs out of battery power just as they get close to the studio that Courtney Love is recording in... and later are so nervous at an official function (where they are pretending to be the media) that they actually fail to ask Courtney Love the required questions. * The appearance of El Duce and his band \"The Mentors\" singing songs about sex slaves while dressed in leather executioner's gear - and then discovering that HE'S the guy who claims Courtney Love asked him to knock off Kurt. * In-depth Interviews with drug addicts and other \"low-life\" who claim to have met Kurt. * Courtney Love's father interpreting certain Nirvana lyrics as being a reference to LSD (a questionable complaint coming from someone who used to work as a roadie for the Grateful Dead). * The interviewer/director getting up at an official ACLU function and speaking directly AFTER Courtney Love's speech. (didn't anyone actually notice?) As all these things came together, I honestly felt that the documentary was SO bad that it could not be anything else but deliberate. Armed with the theory that this was actually a mockumentary I was surprised to learn from a cursory internet search that the film is actually a real attempt at a documentary. Given the complete disaster that this documentary is, the only film that it could therefore be compared to is Ed Wood's \"Plan Nine From Outer Space\". The aimlessness and ineptitude of the documentary is so pronounced that it actually becomes quite entertaining after a while. As soon as El Duce and The Mentors came into the equation I was almost howling on the floor laughing. The conspiracies surrounding Cobain's death should have been treated seriously - but they are examined in such a way as to almost be an insult to those who made the conspiracies up, let alone the memory of Cobain. Neither Dave Grohl nor Krist Novoselic (the other two members of Nirvana) are interviewed or even seen throughout the film. Other major figures, such as Kurt's immediate family, the band's manager and other record company execs are also missing from the film. Instead we are treated to a cavalcade of background figures (most of whom are drug addicts) who claim to have met and influenced Cobain way before he was a star and who all, for some reason, think that it is possible that Kurt had been murdered. Actual important leads - such as evidence that Kurt's credit card was used a few days after his death - are mentioned but never followed up and are eventually forgotten in favour of tracking down the mysterious (and ultimately hilarious) El Duce and spending time with clueless celebrity stalkers who spend more time on camera talking about what they do rather than actually doing anything. In summary, the documentary itself is far more entertaining than the subject it purports to be investigating - but entertaining only because of its chaotic and misguided interviewer who interviews all the wrong people and investigates all the wrong theories. It is about as compelling as driving past a flaming car wreck that had run over and killed a circus clown.",
         "Kurt & Courtney (1998) *** (out of 4) Nick Broomfield's controversial documentary on the suicide of Kurt Cobain and the conspiracy theories around whether or not Courtney Love had him murdered. This is an incredibly strange documentary that has \"witnesses\" that no lawyer in the world would put on the stand but at the same time there's no question that the film will keep you glued to what you're watching. It's hard to say how much truth is found in this documentary or if everything here is nothing more that cruel gossip but I must say that it's rather obvious that Broomfield hates Love. There are a lot of problems with this documentary with the main one being Broomfield's attacks on Love at every chance he gets. It's clear he wants to know whether or not Love killed Cobain but I think there are quite a few cheap shots taken at her. The director is constantly saying how he wanted to use certain music but Love wouldn't allow it. Well, duh. Any music rights owner isn't going to let you freely use something so considering this film ran out of backers it's clear that they wouldn't have had the money to buy the music even if they were for sale. There's an episode at the end when the director could have asked her a question but didn't and instead gets on a stage and does it in public. Another cheap shot. With that said, the murder conspiracy is just something hard to wrap your brain around. Even if it was true, the witnesses here are cracked out heroin addicts so it's really hard to take what they say as the truth. You could argue that Kurt and Courtney were a part of this crowd, which I guess would be fair but I do wonder what motive some of these people had. It's clear that Love's father hates his daughter so his motives are certain. Others claim that they're terrified of Love yet they come out and say she murdered Kurt. No matter what your opinion on the truth is, it's hard to take any real evidence out of this documentary.",
         "Nick Broomfield is a great documentary filmmaker - his pics on Heidi Fleiss & Aileen Wuoronos are especially effective. He was criticized for this film being too one-sided and featuring himself too much. But, as you watch the film, you realize he really had no choice because, everyone (especially people who are pro-Courtney) is terrified of suffering the wrath of Courtney (who is, no matter who you hear from, obviously a violent psychotic) if they speak out in Nick's film. This leaves only people with nothing to lose (addicts, losers, and disgruntled ex-employees) to interview. Thus, most of the footage consists of Broomfield desperately trying to glean ANY information on his chosen subject. What we learn we learn by reading between the lines. For instance, the very fact that Love put pressure on his financers from the very beginning of his filming speaks volumes. If Broomfield didn't set out to lambast her at the start, she certainly helped change his mind quickly. The film does little to clear up the decidedly murky circumstances of Cobain's death (though the guy seemed to be a walking suicidal time-bomb). What it does prove is that Love basically got her claws into Kurt, chewed him up, spit him out, and got his millions - all in a span of about three years! And it's all worth it to see Broomfield call an auditorium full of hypocrites - the ACLU - on the carpet for allowing Love, who regularly makes death threats to journalists, to be their spokesperson for free speech.",
         "Thus is basically, a guy and his camcorder tooling around Seattle and Aberdeen interviewing people who were either irrelevant or had a personal bias against Courtney Love. Apparently he took Ms. Love's resistance to his project very personally, because instead of finding other sources, such as interviewing former Nirvana bandmates Chris Novoselic and David Grohl, or even Chad Channing and Jason Everman who were with the group in its formative years. Most people he talked to barely new Kurt. Instead he focused on portraying Courtney Love as the villain, tossing out wild accusations about her with almost virtually no evidence (or effort), and the testimony of the clearly biased or the unreliable. I can't believe this \"documentary\" was funded, distributed, or worst of all watched by me. This movie was billed as the film Courtney Love doesn't want you to see, maybe she's a film critic.",
         "What a disappointment. I sincerely hope that filmmaker Broomfield meant this as a parody, because there is no other way this picture works. For anyone who thinks that perhaps this was the filmmakers intent, to ridicule his subject, try to imagine what this film would be like if Michael Moore was the director. With the exception of Kurt's aunt, all the people interviewed are pathetic. None of them shed any light on the subject, they only merely establish themselves and the filmmaker as dismal and sad. And if that is not bad enough, they are so uninteresting. I really had a hard time paying attention to this movie and am so grateful I saw it on cable and not for $12 in an art house. Broomfield slams Love every chance he gets, which is about as easy and un-amusing as shooting fish in a barrel. He also elevates Kurt nearly presenting him as a 1990s Buddy Holly, a tortured talented young musician struck down in a great rock and roll death scene. Maybe its too early to say, but Kurt Cobain was no Buddy Holly. As the end mercifully approaches, we are teased into thinking there will be a pay-off. The filmmakers have invaded an ACLU event where Love will be a presenter. After already establishing Love is not interested in protecting the First Amendment, courtesy of threatening phone messages to journalists left by her and Cobain, Broomfield has a chance to confront her on her hypocrisy. But they don't, they instead \"loose the nerve\" because it seems, Love sends out some sort of evil hypnotic vibe that makes even the most cynical of investigators roll over like junkie off a curb. This film is a total waste of time, and any more ink spilled about it and its director is truly futile. If you are interested in poorly made movies about why NASA faked the moon landings, where Elvis is hiding out or how Israeli military intelligence murdered Princess Diana, then you would probably enjoy this film."

         "After rocker Kurt Cobain's death, ruled a suicide, a film crew arrives in Seattle to make a documentary. Director Nick Broomfield talks to lots of people: Cobain's aunt who provides home movies and recordings, the estranged father of Cobain's widow Courtney Love, an L.A. private investigator who worked for Love, a nanny for Kurt and Courtney's child, friends and lovers of both, and others. Although Love won't talk to him and his inquiries lose him financial backing, he comes to believe the coroner's verdict. Portraits emerge: a shy, slight Kurt, weary of touring, embarrassed by fame, hooked on heroin; an out-going Courtney, dramatic, controlling, moving from groupie to star.",
         "A first approach to the mysteries that surrounds the suicide of singer and composer Kurt Cobain in 1994, when he was only 27-years-old. Nick Broomfield, documentary maker from the BBC, makes a tour by the most representative places that witness the rise of the young musician, giving form to a small biopic as well, since his first years in the school in his native Seattle, showing interesting material such as rare recordings of his voice when he was 2-years-old, and the first concerts with his band, Nirvana, at small sceneries. Broomfield interviews important people in Kurt's life, such as his best friend, moving step by step to the bottom line, facing up to Courtney Love's father, who wrote a book who features the theory that Kurt was in fact murdered.",
