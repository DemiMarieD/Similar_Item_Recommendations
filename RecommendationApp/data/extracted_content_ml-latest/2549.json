         "Well, I've seen it twice now. I'm sure that says something. The one thing that I told myself as I went into the theater was \"This isn't the game\". Too many people were expecting Mark Hammil, or Biff from Back to the Future, and were miffed that the movie didn't include them, or anyone that looked like them. So far, I haven't heard anyone say complain that Val Kilmer or George Clooney didn't LOOK like Michael Keaton; the portrayal of their character is a different story... I'll admit, the movie had a cookie-cutter plot. Young guy doesn't realize his potential, young guy is mocked, best friend stands up for him, young guy saves the day. That, and the standard \"Have someone how loves and loses, and someone who falls in love at the end.\" But, then again, how many movies have been made that have a cookie cutter plot? I was quite impressed with the acting. I'll admit, I haven't been a big fan of the teen slasher movies, so this was my first experience at seeing a lot of these guys. The young Blair was portrayed exactly as I would have expected, not too sure of himself, too willing to scurry into a corner rather than face confrontation. Maniac was great; much better than the poor portrayal in the last 3 iterations of the video game. I mean, let's face it, Maniac's character was completely re-done in WC3, to make him exactly like Biff. And Paladin was excellent. Not anything like the Paladin of the games (it took a while to get used to a non-scottish Paladin), but a very good, dark, but fatherly figure. The effects were incredible, especially when you consider the (relatively) meager budget the film was done on. Yeah, the NavCom looked like a car battery, and the Kilrathi were lacking. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if the original intent was to NOT show the Kilrathi at all; someone decided this would be too artistic of a move, and created some cheesy looking aliens at the last minute. My favorite aspect of the movie, though, was how it abandons the standard \"Everything is bright and pretty and technological in Sci-Fi\". The ships were beat on. The cruisers looked like they had to be held together with bailing wire. The bridges of the vessels were dark, cramped, and simple. The ships shot bullets, rather giving us bright and technical laser beams. Also, humanity wasn't portrayed as being perfect; there were factions, and racism, and everything else that we experience on earth today. I'm just waiting for the DVD...",
         "I finally gave into my curiosity and rented \"Wing Commander\" last night... and I found myself kinda... you know... liking it. It is NOT great cinema or great science fiction -- everyone likes to climb all over this movie for scientific errors and not being close enough to the Wing Commander games. Well, scientific inaccuracies don't bug me (I'm an English major!), and I never played the Wing Commander game. Maybe that's the secret to enjoying this movie -- if you take it completely on its (meager) merits, it's not all that bad. It's nowhere near as good as classics like \"Star Wars\" or even somewhat similar films like \"The Last Starfighter\" or \"Starship Troopers,\" but it entertained me. I dunno, sometimes you don't need your horizons challenged, you just want to sit back and watch aliens get blow'd up real good, you know? I consider this a guilty pleasure.",
         "I was intrigued, after hearing many different points of views on this movie, to go see it. So I go to this used tape store, (why rent it for $5 when you can buy it for $2?) and buy it. I just wanted to see which side I agreed with. Most people that stated their opinions, said that this movie was a waste of time. Other people said it was the best movie they've ever seen, but I'm guessing they were fans of the video game or the 1977 version of this movie, both of which I've never seen. To go straight to the point and make it easy for those who don't know whether to see it or not, I'll let you decide for yourself based on my opinion. So to make it simple I'll just say the good and bad stuff about it. Bad Stuff: ~Freddie Prinze Jr. sucks at acting. There's no other way to put it. I got very bored watching his one expression and monotone voice. ~Right from the beginning, I thought the music was terrible. Music is supposed to drag you in from the beginning and give you a sense of what's coming, (think \"Jaws.\") This just made me feel like I was about to see Captain America. ~The alien make-up was so extremely ridiculous that they looked like overgrown house pets. Not scary at all. ~I got tired of hearing people state the obvious. \"Hey! I think something's wrong!\" Well, aren't you the sharp one. The exploding bombs and loud \"red alert\" beeping didn't give it away, did it? ~The story had it's boring moments. There were parts I didn't follow and soon didn't even care, because I had gotten so lost by then it didn't matter. ~*This may or may not be a downside* I wasn't sure if the accents in this movie were taken from the video game or original, but it was way too weird. We had a Scottish guy, a ton of Englishmen, Americans, and some Asians. How did they all get on this one ship? Good Stuff: ~Matthew Lillard did a fabulous job. I'm so used to seeing him act like an a**hole, (no offense, think \"Scream.\") that I wasn't expecting the serious performance he gave. It blew me away how serious he had to be in some scenes, and he pulled it off beautifully. (Although I gave the movie 5 stars, I would like to give his performance a 10.) ~The plotline, although confusing, did have it's certain interesting moments. I don't know which came first, Starship Troopers or this, but I have a feeling one of them is a rip-off of the first. However, it certainly had it's moments that put you in suspense. ~The special effect were great. It reminded me a lot of Star Wars. And the battle scenes were exciting. ~The rest of the cast didn't do too bad a job of acting. I was able to feel sorry for most of them. I gave this movie a 5. If you have nothing better to do, I suggest you watch it. I certainly have seen worse, (read my review of \"Jeepers Creepers.\") If you liked \"Starship Troopers\" this is a movie for you. However, if you want something more out of a Sci-Fi movie of this sort, I suggest \"Pitch Black.\" *****/10",
         "The film has been critically panned and it bombed at the cinemas. But it's actually a pretty good film. Yes it isn't technically the best, nor is it scientifically plausible. And for devotees of the games it kinda screws with history, but for all that it is a good ride. You watch it and appreciate it. Saffron Burrows is great. David Warner and David Suchet excel in their (small) roles. It's a shame John Rhys-Davis and Mark Hamill don't reprise their roles, but their replacements do well enough. You get caught up in the story, and the visual effects are fantastic, aided by good acting with the actors working well together. So overall I would recommend this film. Don't expect it to be fantastic, but just enjoy it. It's a fun film and a worthy addition to Wing Commander lore.",
         "People are way too hard on this movie. The acting is better than average and action is awesome. This alone makes up for the weak plot and so so special effects. And it moves at such a pace that it is impossible to be bored unlike Star Wars Episode 1 where I sat through that entire pod race scene wondering when it was going to end. I'm not saying that this is better than Star Wars but I could watch this movie over and over which is something I couldn't say for Star Wars. (***/****)",
         "I was pleasantly surprised by this movie after reading the bad prior reviews. It is a good combat science fiction movie. The special effects were really good considering the budget of the film. The acting was decent, and the story was well written. The only problem I had was the poor effects of the Kilrathi, they did not look good at all. Fans of the wing commander games should go see this movie with an open mind. No Mark Hammil, but the movie is not any lesser with him missing. See this film, you will like it. 10/10",
         "First of all, I avoided this movie when it was first released because of the bad reviews. I never played the game so I had no idea what to expect. I should know better... I saw this movie for the first time on DVD, sat down with a low expectation, and cranked up my Dolby Digital 5.1 sound system. Was I ever BLOWN away! It was more than I expected and the characters were not as \"forgettable\" as some critics said. I found the performances of Tcheky Kanyo (Paladin) and David Warner (Admiral Tolwyn) were memorable. Saffron Burrows (Angel) was great, except that she handled her \"crisis\" at the end rather badly. But overall the movie was a treat. I would recommend it for anyone to at least rent this and check it out!",
         "I know this guy who works at a multiplex and is a movie maniac. He insists that \"Wing Commander\" is the worst movie ever made, so when I saw that SciFi Channel was going to air it this week, I thought, \"Oh, good! I will get to see it for free and see if it's everything my friend promises it is, because I've got a perverse obsession with bad movies!\" I will tell you how much I... well, I suppose the word is \"enjoyed\"... \"Wing Commander\" by describing my favorite part of the movie for you. The setting is a big war in outer space between Earthlings and some aliens called the Kilrathi (more about them later), and most of the action we are chiefly concerned with takes place on a big spaceship that is something like an aircraft carrier. The hero's annoying best friend and his sort-of-girlfriend have disobeyed the leader of their team and, thanks to Cosmic Revenge, the sort-of-girlfriend dies when she crashes her little spaceship into the landing pad thing on the big ship. Now, this is supposed to be the big, dramatic sad part. We cut from a scene where the hero's annoying best friend is crying and begging to save his sort-of-girlfriend, to a scene where the sort-of-girlfriend's ship is being pushed by a little snowplow off the runway thing of the big ship. In the middle of Outer Space. In Zero Gravity. I suppose there's some B.S. about there being big magnets or something lining the runway so that the ships can't just float away. But, you know, that's something that's supposed to be the screenplay writers' responsibility to tell us. My second favorite part is when we finally see the Kilrathi for the first time. At about the forty-five minute mark, it occurred to me that we don't even know who or what the Kilrathi are. We only know that they're at war with Earth and that they hate humans. But for the first full hour and a half or so, we don't even know what a Kilrathi looks like. Well, the Kilrathi end up being something like an anthropomorphic Mr. Bigglesworth. And they really like fog machines. When the hero and his buddies invade the Kilrathi ship, the whole place is choked with green fog. Oh, and for all this, we never find out why they hate humans. I came up with a theory. The Kilrathi are the descendants of a bunch of hairless cats who were sent in a probe many years ago to a strange planet. This planet was highly irradiated, and the cats were sent there to see if Earthlings could survive on it. Well, the radiation made the cats evolve very quickly, and eventually their descendants began to look more and more humanoid. They built some spaceships and went to war against humanity, to avenge the fact that the humans never remembered to clean out their grandparents' litter boxes. As for the green fog, that's to remind all the Kilrathi of the awful stench their ancestors had to suffer when their litter was left unchanged. But, again, this is the screenwriter's job. And I'm not even going to start on the whole \"Pilgrim\" thing. \"Wing Commander\" gets a three, because of it's parody value and because it isn't as bad as my friend promised but it's close. VERY close. Essentially, this is the kind of movie that \"Starship Troopers\", as a *very* small part of it's agenda, set out to parody. Go watch that movie instead. It's a great date movie.",
         "I have to say i liked it a lot. The environment is well created, so are the dialogs and the ships. The special effects are pretty good, the dark atmosphere gives the movie a \"grim and dark future\" look. The only negative thing is the fighting scenes, they look just unreal and penalize the whole movie. The plot is simple, they travel through quasars to save the earth from a Killrathi invasion, these aliens look like big cats wielding some technologically advanced sticks. The cameras are always centered on Lt. Blair, so the shape of the Killrathi is shrouded in mystery until the third quarter of the movie. Overall it's a really good movie, with a great atmosphere that will make you say \"Ok, i didn't waste these two hours\".",
         "I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The graphics weren't up to say Episode1 standards, but were convincing enough (and I loved the raspy engine noise for the Rapiers). The acting was what I've come to expect from these younger American actors (as in good). I'd say from an objective view point it's a good film. A bit lacking in certain areas, but certainly enjoyable. I say \"objective\" simply because I have never been exposed to the hugely popular game series, so I was seeing this as a film, not as a spin off (in which case I'm sure it would come across worse, simply because when you're used to one set of actors portraying your favourite characters a new team will never fit the bill). Overall not a bad way to spend my Wednesday evening."

After destroying a Terran base, the Kilrathi have seized a NAVCOM unit with the hyperspace jump coordinates to Earth. With Terran reinforcements scheduled to arrive two hours after the Kilrathi hit Earth, it falls upon the starfighter carrier TCS Tiger Claw to keep the Kilrathi busy.",

Half a millennium after the first ships launched in search of a better life, the Pilgrims still are discriminated. When the Kilrathi declare war against the human race, it is up to Christopher Blair, Pilgrim halfling, to help avoid complete annihilation. Since the Kilrathi managed to conquer a Navcom unit, they know the jump coordinates to Earth. And since the terran fleet is two hours further away from home than the Kilrathi fleet, the only hope of Mankind is to set trust in a Pilgrim, who can astrogate by feeling and does not need a Navcom unit - it's all genetics.",
