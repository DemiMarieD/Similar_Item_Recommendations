         "This was one of the strangest movie I've ever seen, but at the same time, one of the most meaningful. This was a good movie. There was a sadistic violence, a bunch of sex scenes, vulgarity, more graphic violence, more sex, a three way, and an incredibly sad, tragic ending. If you are able to look past all this (many people cannot, mind you), than you will see a good movie about three teenage tortured souls cruising along the urban pits of Los Angeles, who run into a crazy clerk with a shotgun, a crazy drive thru attendant with a shotgun, a nasty blonde with a sword, and some really scary Neo Nazis, who all think Amy Blue is someone else. Rose McGowen is Amy Blue, the sexy, angry, speed taking, tough as nails lead character, James Duval is Amy's naive, stoner boyfriend Jordan White, and Johnathon Schaech was Xavier Red, the crazy, dangerous, kinky, and violent source of trouble. If you have a strong stomach, and don't mind harshly sad endings, check it out, but be aware, because you might get grossed out and leave (I almost did). 9/10",
         "(my comments are based on the uncensored 85 min. director's cut. stay away from the butchered 72 min. cut R-rated version) everytime i have seen this movie i always have the same reaction. What a strange, f**ked up film!! the film has a real sleazy look to it and it fits the subject matter like a glove. the movie is basically stating that todays teenagers are basically damned souls creating and existing in a hell of their own creation. Rose McGowan fans should take note that she basically stays nude and in some provocative and graphic sexual situations throughout practically the whole movie. i've never been that big of a fan of hers. other than having fantastic breasts, up until seeing this movie i never found much to like about her. she seems to exist in her other movies just as window dressing. well, for some reason she seems to really connect with her character in this movie and bring a highly believable sense of in your face sexuality that really makes an impression on the viewer. the other actors in the movie do pretty solid work but in my opinion this is really a Rose McGowan vehicle. when violence occurs in this movie it's usually very quick, explicit and bloody. the numerous sex scenes and dialogue are also more explicit than most people would care for. the filmmakers leave nothing to the imagination and that is this movie's strong point in my opinion. if you really want to check something out that is different but at the same time a good movie, check this one out. but be warned it is a weird, weird movie. rating:7 (unrated version)",
         "Asian-American director Gregg Araki's first \"heterosexual movie\" (as the opening credits declare) is a lurid, drug-fueled romp about teen angst, sex, voyeurism, murder, consumerism and homophobia. It's also a lot of fun, in an ironically kitsch, acquired-taste sort of way. At the time of its 1995 release The Doom Generation was firmly entrenched as part of the 'new queer cinema' (a movement which sought to break down notions of 'normal' heterosexuality through transgression and subversion rather than through polemic statements). The film sets out to explore a sexual dynamic that lies well outside the traditional boy-meets-girl (or even boy-meets-boy) structure of 99% of American movies, but it does do with its tongue firmly planted in (between) cheek(s). The plot is extraordinarily simple. Teen couple Amy White (Rose McGowan, best known as small screen witch Paige Matthews from Charmed) and Jordan White (James Duval, more recently seen as Frank in cult film Donnie Darko) accidentally save the seductive, psychotic bisexual Xavier Red (Jonathon Schaech) from a violent gang of homophobes (played by members of industrial band Skinny Puppy) before throwing him out of their car a short time later. The trio meets again later that night at the scene of an accidental convenience store murder, forcing them into an uncomfortable intimacy as they flee the scene of the crime. Before long this intimacy develops significantly, in scenes which display a truly erotic frisson. The film is deliberately trashy, satirizing western culture's love of consumption and surface beauty while simultaneously commenting on the homophobia underlying traditional macho braggadocio. It's also influenced by such classic genres as the road movie and the horror film, in particular taking the horror movie's obsession with bodily penetration and perverse sexuality (as typified by the likes of Alien and The Fly) to occasionally shocking extremes. With its garish, adolescent energy and deft ear for teen culture's dialog and self-obsessed behavior, not to mention a too-cool-for-school soundtrack of mid-90's alternative bands (as well as a cameo by Janes's Addiction's Perry Farrell among others), Gregg Araki's The Doom Generation is an occasionally infuriating but wildly entertaining sex-murder romp whose ending is all the more powerful for the light tone the film has previously employed. RICHARD WATTS",
         "The opening credits claim this is a `heterosexual' movie by Gregg Araki\u0085 Now that statement is still open for discussion. Something that isn't open of discussion is the fact Araki created one of the meanest, most good-looking pieces of trash of the 90's! Imagine yourself a lesser-hyped version of `Natural Born Killers' and exclude that last bit of political correctness. It seems like Araki was testing how far he could go\u0085and then cheerfully exaggerated some more. The Doom Generation is a speed-driven and absurd road movie against all forms of good taste. A young couple, accompanied by a trigger-happy madman, faces the most eccentric situations and deal with the most extravagant characters. The film contains a lot of violence but even more absurd and demoralizing humor, so the whole thing never really becomes disturbing or provocative. Lots of naughty language and nudity, though! Rose McGowan's character Amy is the closest thing to a cult/trash queen we saw in the 90's and her naked body is always a joy to behold. James Duvall (sort of like Araki's lead in his entire teenage-alienation trilogy) is terrific as the confused teenager with the `whatever' attitude! Gregg Araki's visions are downright brilliant from time to time. Many people don't seem to think so (just check the other comments around here) but his film is extremely stylish and a perfect portrayal of a pop culture generation. Heck, even his colorful slang \u0096 which includes a whole dictionary of genitalia synonyms \u0096 alone is worth the effort. The Doom Generation is one the most special films of the past decade and it really deserves the cult-followings it developed over the years. Check it out if you're open-minded, not quickly offended and not faint of heart!",
         "Gregg Araki's THE DOOM GENERATION is reminiscent of everything from MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO to THE RIVER'S EDGE to TRUE ROMANCE to the experimental films of Pasolini, of Warhol (Morrisey), as well as of Richard Kern. The film reveals its thematic message when the most innocent and selfless of its three main characters asks the other, more self-centered, two if they ever think about the meaning of existence. Dismissing the very question, they reveal to the questioner an answer of sorts, one which suggests that we each create a meaning for ourselves, and are all existentially alone as we do so. While offering us a rather slight story of a pair of teen lovers on the road who encounter a slightly older bisexual who becomes their nemesis, companion, lover and protector, THE DOOM GENERATION offers a great deal of visual style and wit, and some genuine moments of suspense. In fact, the film's gory and discomforting climactic scene is perhaps the artistic highlight and suggests some real filmaking talent by writer/director Gregg Araki. This is probably not everyone's cup of tea, but is worth a look for those who like a film which challenges them to react to strong imagery and who don't mind transgressive depictions.",
         "I write this because I read a harsh critic from a fellow watcher here and I don't really understand his opinion. this movie is highly surrealistic, and in its on way very truthful - regarding the fact that it shows the story through the eyes of these overcharacterized stereotypical teens. being an eastern European guy, I think I can say that this movie requires the watcher to step out of his usual westernized filters he's watching films through, and try to be as objective a listener as possible. I must disagree with the opinion that this movie has to be taken seriously - this is a weird kind of entertainment, weird in a positive way like those C-trash horrors that are so bad you start to collect them on your shelf. araki may not be the brightest star in independent film-making, but he's reasonably strong and original. I recommend this to mature people who don't think that knowing high arts requires them to deny their childhood classics or spider-man. watch it with much self-irony and have a good time. :)",
         "Wow. What a film. This highly enterntaining, slick, fast movie, requires multiple viewings. The more you put in the more you get out. The story is a simple one. A teenage couple, sick of the world, pick up a drifter after a concert at quite a metaphorical venue. They then get dragged through murder, drugs, sex (Highly un-erotic), ya know, the usual. The dreamy, surreal visuals are a delight, and the symbollic use of colours and light are mind-blowing if not hypnotic. Please dont be disgusted, during the first viewing, instead look between the lines, where you will find the truth. I highly recommend this film to anyone who like to ask 'why?'.",
         "Scaldingly angry and hateful, this is the tale of a trio of young people on a roadtrip to hell. Amy Blue and Jordan White are a teenage couple who have been dating \"a really long time\"- 3 months. One night Xavier Red jumps in the backseat of Amy's car and leads them on a mad, illicit journey through Greg Arraki's twisted vision of young America. Much has been made of the 'excessive' violence and sex this movie has, but that very excess is part of the point- that pointless excess has led the youth of America down a path where death barely registers, and intimacy doesn't at all. Greg Arraki *likes* these 3 characters. He grieves for the innocence they never even had and the love they try to fashion from the bloody shards of their hearts. And he rages at the widely held and ever-so-patriotic belief that regressing back into intolerance is the answer to America's problems, especially in regards to the young. Maybe he's looking for a third option, one that actually does children good, rather than oppressing them or leaving them to run wild in an irresponsible world. Rose McGowan once stated that Amy, with her sharp tongue and wounded eyes, is Rose herself at 15. Like Amy, Rose suffered a horrible childhood and because she put her fury and pain into her character, any 15-year-old girl who has suffered at the hands of those who are supposed to protect her can relate. Jordan is just adrift. He finds that Amy is having sex with Xavier, and he dismisses it- a soft, honest \"whatever, Amy.\" Xavier plays demon-imp, tormenting and tempting Amy and Jordan headlong into their bleak, surreal adventure. Ultimately this story is Amy's, and the story is about isolation- hence Amy's whispered, matter-of-fact assertion at the beginning that \"there's just no place for us in this world\", her attempts to connect with both boys in the only way she knows how, and then her unseeing stare at the end.",
         "*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* I bought this video. They weren't looking for trouble, but trouble found them. They are the Doom Generation. Is it an exploitative movie about bored youths killing and sleeping their way across the land of convenience stores and cheap motels or is it a cry for help for the disaffected, nihilistic American youth of today? Why, it's a little of both! Rose McGowan and two guys hit the road. Some people would call it America. The Doom Generation calls it Hell. The number 666 saturates the landscape. Their motel room number, the price of their chili dogs, in fact, every number is 666. It all makes sense since they are in Hell. A Hell they may have created with their nonstop violence and meaningless sex? Hey man, whatever. They're the Doom Generation. Don't bum them out. Rose McGowan has a \"Pulp Fiction\" Uma Thurman-type haircut which looks great on her bored head. She is topless through a lot of this movie as her favorite pastime is getting to know her two guys intimately. There's also plenty of blood and guts as the killer trio seems to find a reason to kill some loser at every stop. Needless to say, I enjoyed this fine film. \"The Doom Generation\" is worth a look.",
         "I am a big fan of Gregg Araki's movies especially the trilogy this movie is a part of. My friends and I have even assembled our own little cult following for it. It is for sure a twisted and perverse movie but at the same time it has a message and funny all at the same time. I would only recommend this if you are into shocking, graphic commentary on our society and can stomach violence and sexual deviance. Now since the waring is out of the way I want to say i think this movie is genius and i love the WTF? feeling you get after watching this and the other two movie in this series (Nowhere and Totally F***ed Up). If you do watch this movie and don't like it the first time I suggest you watch it again, i promise after the initial shock you will see the art behind it all."
