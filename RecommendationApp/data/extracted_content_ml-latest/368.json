         "content": "From the moment I slapped eyes on this hombre, I smelled trouble. And re-fried beans.\r\n\r\nMaverick is directed by Richard Donner and written by William Goldman. It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. \r\n\r\nAfter Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. \r\n\r\nHarmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10",

      "synopsis": "The story, set in the American Old West, is a first-person account by a wisecracking gambler 'Bret Maverick' (Mel Gibson), of his misadventures on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. Besides wanting to win the poker championship for the money, he also wants to prove, once and for all, that he is 'the best'. However, complications keep getting in the way. Maverick rides into the fictional town of Crystal River intending to collect money owed to him, as he is $3000 short of the poker tournament entry fee of $25,000. His efforts to make up this $3000 provide some plot motivation, as well as diversions caused by, and in the company of, three people he encounters at Crystal River-an antagonist named Angel (Alfred Molina), a young con-artist calling herself Mrs Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), and legendary lawman Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner, who played Bret Maverick in the original TV series). The first two are also rival poker players. Maverick, Bransford and Cooper share a stagecoach (the driver of which dies at the reins at full gallop), agree to help a wagon train of migrant evangelist settlers who have been waylaid by ruffians (for a fee which Maverick in the end is too big-hearted to accept) and are headed-off by a troop of Indians led by \"Joseph\" (Graham Greene). Unknown to his companions, Joseph and Maverick are good friends, and Maverick allows himself to be \"captured.\" Joseph is another one of his unreliable debtors, and in and around his tribal grounds they collaborate on a scheme to swindle a Russian Grand Duke. During this time, Angel has received a mysterious telegram ordering him to not allow Maverick to reach the poker game, and has also learned that Maverick had conned him in Crystal River. These scenes are some of the very few which do not involve Maverick directly. Angel catches up with Maverick after he has left Joseph's tribe, beats him up and attempts to hang him. Despite being tied to both a tree and to his horse, Maverick escapes and reaches the poker game-on a paddle steamer-safely. Bransford and Angel have also reached the game, and Cooper who is engaged to ensure the security of the game. After preliminary rounds, the four finalists are Maverick, Bransford, Angel, and the Commodore of the boat (James Coburn). Maverick almost fails to reach the final table by the 5:00am deadline, having had his stateroom door chained (by an unknown person) after a short tryst with Bransford. The game proceeds, with Bransford the first eliminated, and shortly thereafter a \"fixed\" hand is dealt to the three remaining players. The Commodore is given four 8s and Angel is given a low straight flush, whilst Maverick has the 10, Jack, Queen and King of Spades. The Commodore and Angel each bet \"all in\" (inferring that Maverick is the chip leader at this stage). Maverick observes the dealer bottom-dealing to the others, protests the conduct of the hand, and eventually accepts one card dealt by Angel and calls the bets without checking the card. It is, melodramatically, the Ace of Spades (Note that a 9 of Spades would also have won the hand for Maverick). An enraged Angel draws his gun but he, and his stooges in the audience, are gunned down in rapid succession by Cooper and Maverick (drawing one of Cooper's guns). Three plot twists follow Maverick's win: Firstly, Cooper steals the $500,000 prize money instead of presenting it to Maverick. Secondly, it is revealed that the Commodore and Cooper were secretly in cahoots on the theft and that Angel had actually been working for the Commodore. Thirdly, Maverick ambushes the two around a campfire and steals back the money. He leaves them with a single gun to settle their affairs. Cooper beats up the Commodore and angrily vows to wreak bloody vengeance on Maverick, even if it means hunting him to the ends of the earth. Later, Maverick is relaxing in a bath-house when Cooper finds him, and drops the facade to reveal (to the audience) that he is in fact Maverick's father. It is also revealed that the real conspiracy was between the two of them. Suddenly, however, Bransford enters the bath-house and robs Cooper and Maverick (whose relationship she had easily surmised). However, she only gets away with half of the money she had expected, as Maverick had hidden the rest in his boots. Maverick smiles and comments that it will be a lot of fun getting the rest of the money back from her.",

         "As a kid, I used to watch reruns of the original \"Maverick\" -- and so I looked forward to seeing this one when it came out in the theaters. I was NOT disappointed! Mel Gibson's Maverick is a bit more goofy than James Garner's, but is every bit as charming, sly, and entertaining. A number of excellent cameos provide some comic relief, especially Danny Glover near the beginning of the movie. But by far the best casting is reserved for the original Maverick, James Garner, who is cast in a featured role, and who has surprises in store for darn near everyone. Most movies remade from old TV series ignore the stars that made them popular enough to BE remade -- kudos to the producers of this film, who apparently know better. Other roles are filled capably; the biggest surprise for me was Jodie Foster, whom I normally dislike on screen. She is very impressive in a rare comedic role, and thankfully discards her repetoire of facial tics for a much more natural performance here. The plot is kept pretty simple until near the end -- and the end has a great twist, which I won't divulge. Suffice it to say that your time will be well spent, and you'll want to revisit Maverick country more than once.",
         "After making entertaining movies such as the \"Lethal Weapon\" movies, \"The Goonies\" and \"Scrooged\", Richard Donner the man behind all those movies, brings us \"Maverick\", an excellent and fun 'modern' western with a fun story and entertaining characters played by veteran-actors who seemed to have lots of fun working on this movie. The best thing about \"Maverick\" is the 'fun' feeling that this movie has. You can tell that the actors worked on this movie with lots of pleasure and fun. Mel Gibson is a wonderful and fun leading man as Bert uhmm I mean Bret Maverick. The cast is filled with many other big names such as: Jodie Foster, James Garner, Graham Greene, Alfred Molina, James Coburn, Dan Hedaya, Margot Kidder and Danny Glover in a fun cameo. The story is really strong and full with fun twists and plenty of comical situations. Yes, \"Maverick\" is a real fun 'no worries' movie. Truly one of the most underrated movies. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
         "I laughed throughout this movie. Mel Gibson still managed to stay suave and handsome as usual even though his character is supposed to be \"bumbling.\" He and Jodie Foster had amazing chemistry. I enjoyed Danny Glover's cameo and reference to the \"Lethal Weapon\" movies. And James Garner, the original Maverick, was a delight. The movie had a bunch of twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end. (Mel's bathtub scene helped, too.)",
         "This is one of those rare movies you can watch over and over again without getting tired of it. Forget what some people have said about Jodie Foster, she is absolutely perfect as the apparently-dumb-but-smarter-than-she-looks blonde, and the chemistry between her and Mel Gibson is superb. Also perfect are James Garner as the marshal, Graham Greene as the harassed native chief, and Alfred Molina (the Englishman who is so good as an Iranian in Not Without My Daughter and a Cuban in The Perez family) as the \"Spaniard\". The writing is simply brilliant, one of William Goldman's best - how anyone could describe it as \"virtually plotless\" just staggers the imagination. The direction and cinematography are superb. A special treat is the Lethal Weapon reprise with Danny Glover.",
         "A good mix of comedy, drama, suspense and nice scenery all make this a pleasing viewing experience. (Most people watching this leave with a smile on their face.) This \"western\" is really a lot more of a comedy, but so was the TV show on which it was based. In the movie, we get some really neat twists at the end, too. Kudos also for including TV's original \"Maverick\" - James Garner - in this film. Mel Gibson (the \"new\" Maverick) and Jodie Foster play off each other well in the leads and Graham Greene has some very funny lines as a supporting player. Alfred Molina, James Coburn, Geoffrey Lewis also shine in supporting performances and it is really fun to see all the cameo appearances in here. Included in there were a couple of old-time western movie stars along with country-western singers, all at a big card game at the end. Another plus are the two songs during the ending credits. There is rousing C&W rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" followed by a good Randy Newman song called \"Ride Gambler Ride.\" They are worth sticking around and hearing. One negative about this film: the message seems to be that cheating, lying and just being a dishonorable person if okay if you can get away with it!! (Only in Hollywood!)",
         "Maverick is one most favourite Mel Gibson idol, and is truly an American icon. In the western/comedy genre movies of all time cinema history, Maverick comes anyhow in the top-5 list. After the several failures of Red Kit(Lucky Luke)'s cinema adaptation between 1991-1993; Roy Huggins's \"Maverick TV-series\" of 1950s' had been enriched with the Hanna&Barbera vision of Lucky Luke(1984 TV-cartoon series) to integrate the whole concept of writing a new modern day Maverick by the writer William Goldman. There are a bunch of similarities between these two Western legends, but still Maverick's story was unique and impressive. Here in my review I would much rather talk about this movie itself, instead of its production values. Anyway, if you would like to share your opinions with me and everybody else, visit my message board topic with the title \"40 factors that Lucky Luke and Maverick have in common\". Director Donner has preferred a left-in-the-middle Adventure type opening right away in the first scene, as if it's a continuation to Maverick's adventures. His antagonist, performed by British actor Alfred Molina, has left him in a trapped dilemma; that appears to our eyes as Maverick is just about to die. As the widely known old saying says: \"A person recalls his life just before he dies\" , Maverick starts to tell his story to sum up the reason how he ended up being in that deadly dilemma. Under his narration, we're welcomed to a heart-warmingly told weirdo story. He's been collecting money to enroll in a Poker tournament and travelling the country through several adventures. What makes Maverick memorable and unique in style is first of all, the mood. There is a political film-noir view that we get every time we meet a new character. Every single character, even the cameos in this movie is so selfish, rebel and against the law. Robbery, racketeering, murder, gambling, bribery, deception is a must-have character profile for all. The sheriff of a town is in debt with fugitives. A credible police chief steals a $500,000 poker tournament prize from his son. A son of a police chief is a bandit. Well, his father known as the most credible police chief in Western America; and he even steals money from his own single child son. Even the most likable Jodie Foster's Annabelle character tries to steal money from everywhere, she fools every man to steal their wallet; even from a dead old poor wagon rider It's very absurd and reasonable at the same time that this is the greatest dreamy Western adventureland ever that the audience is witnessed. After this great accomplishment, who cares if there are gaps in the plot? Indians might be so friendly(especially after Dances With Wolves, all the American Indians in Western movies somehow has become very friendly). All the bandits might be sappy. Set Designs might be cheap and distracting. Audio and sound effects might be the lowest quality. But still with craggy zigzagged narrated style of editing works perfect, and thus the film always rises unexpected incidents and surprises. The zigzags of the storytelling keeps the viewers' attention on trying to find the reasons why each character chooses to do what they do. Cinematography and directing of photography are also admirable. The sceneries are taken in rivers of Arizona, uplands of Oregon, canyons of Utah, prairies of Washington, Yosemite National Park of California. It feels like a falsely guided visit to Western states; Maverick says that he's going to the poker tournament in New York, while in the actual Earth geography he's in Yosemite. This film was nominated only in Costume Design category at the Academy Awards, but instead Hugo Weaving & Guy Pearce's Australian desert comedy won it. Maverick can be seen entirely by everyone. Mostly with humour and film-noir comedy of Old West, it's also worth your time for Poker/Road Trip Sceneries/Adventure/Cowboy Gunfights/Living with the Indians segments.",
         "Maverick is just a good time movie with Mel Gibson doing a great job in the title role. James Garner as the elder,who used the name Zane cooper,was flawless, and Jodie Foster played a great part too. It's a great escape movie for 2 hours and filled with just as much comedy as it is with action. A great film to watch-Magictrain",
         "I Recently saw this film for the second time and the film is really amusing. Mel Gibson plays his roll terrific and the film has a great number of unexpected developments. The film is really enjoyable and i think the nomination for the Oscar is justified. I think that the majority of people agree with me on this and that this film has become a classic over the years. The story is surprising and unexpected developments,the action and humor make it that this film has become such a great popularity.",
         "Always thought this was great. Makes me laugh no end. When he lets himself go, Mel Gibson is funny, and this pastiche of an almost forgotten TV cowboy show - complete with its original star cast in the main supporting role - is comedy gold. Better yet, this is Jodie Foster's only real brush with the comedy genre and she proves so adept at it that you can't help feeling this route would have been better than Nell and Anna And The King. The ending piles twist upon twist, and it's one of those movies where everyone involved is clearly having such a great time that you do too.",
         "Starring: Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, James Garner Ah, the old west. Personally, I'm not big into western movies, which would probably explain why I like this movie. It isn't a western. It just happens to take place in the old west. Maverick is the story of a poker player (Gibson) who is going against all odds to get into a championship poker tournament to find out once and for all just how good he really is. The movie starts with Bret Maverick at the end of a noose, sitting on a horse, out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by the men who put the noose around his neck in the first place. Then the movie goes into a flashback that tells about the week leading up to this point. A very large chunk of the movie takes place in the flashback. Bret hasn't had the best of luck over the last week. His horse was stolen and he had to replace it with a donkey, his friends double cross him when it comes to issues of money that they owe him, he nearly gets his butt kicked after a game of poker goes sour, his lucky shirt gets shrunk, and all sorts of other misfortunes. While playing poker he meets Mrs. Annabelle Bransford (Foster), a thief who is also trying to get into the poker tournament. They get stuck riding on the same stagecoach together, along with Marshal Zane Cooper (Garner). True to Bret's luck, the driver has a heart attack and the coach goes out of control. He plays the hero and stops it of course, since he is the hero of the movie, and they continue along on their way to the tournament. They encounter a group of settlers that have been robbed by Indians, or at least who believe they have been robbed by Indians, and Bret agrees to help them get back their stuff for a cut of the money he'd be recovering for them. He finds the group of whites who were masquerading as Indians and gets the goods from them, and then when they return the goods, real Indians show up, ones that are actually friends with Bret. The encounter between the Indians and the settlers is one of the more hilarious parts of the movie. After Bret goes along with the Indians and has some interesting encounters with them, we finally catch up to the present, where Bret is dangling from that noose again. He gets out of it and makes his way to the poker tournament. I'm not going to say whether he wins or loses the tournament, but I'm sure you can guess. But if you haven't seen this movie before, there are probably quite a few things you won't be able to guess, as this movie has many different plot twists and turns along the way. It's absolutely hilarious and in my opinion, a classic. Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)"

         "Maverick is recreated from the character James Garner created in the 1950s TV program. Maverick is a gambler who would rather con someone than fight them. He needs an additional three thousand dollars in order to enter a Winner Take All poker game that begins in a few days. He tries to win some, tries to collect a few debts, and recover a little loot for the reward, all with a light hearted air. He joins forces with a woman gambler with a marvelous, though fake, southern accent as the two both try and enter the game.",

Things are rarely what they seem, as layers of shameless deception are unfolded.",
