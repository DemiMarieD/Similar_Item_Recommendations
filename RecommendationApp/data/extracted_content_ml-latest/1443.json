Lots of unique music and wonderful stories of a musical group that was at one time the toast of their specific community in NYC. My only complaint is the movie is in black and white. I don't see the point. Color would have added so much more to the picture. The music is historic, but they are not recreating the olden days. All the scenes are contemporary. So just film it in color, nothing lost!!! It is certainly worth seeing for the musical value and the historical extra value."],
