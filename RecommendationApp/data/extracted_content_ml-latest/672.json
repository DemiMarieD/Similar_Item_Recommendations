      "reviews": ["Feisty young photographer Diana Di Sorella (a fine and appealing performance by Mira Sorvino) has to come to terms with her rich Italian heritage and her mixed feelings about her immigrant mother in the wake of her mother's untimely passing. Director/co-writer Helen De Michiel neatly crafts a low-key and thoughtful drama about emotional closure and making peace with your past that doesn't get bogged down in icky cute sentiment or cheesy melodramatics. Sorvino brings a warmth and vitality to her part which holds the picture together. Rose Gregorio gives a terrific portrayal of Pina, a kindly neighbor and loyal family friend who helps Diana on her turbulent personal journey. Matthew Lillard also contributes an engaging turn as Diana's nice boyfriend Matt. Moreover, there's a nifty use of puppets used for the poignant flashbacks about Diana's childhood. The deliberate pace takes a little getting used to, but overall this movie tells a pleasingly simple story with great tact and clarity and delivers a considerable amount of poignancy. Both Teodoro Mariaci's crisp cinematography and Norman Noll's melodic score are up to speed. A real sleeper."],
