         "Although I was aware of the original plan to renew the Fantasia concept every so often, and that it was visualised as an ongoing project, I felt that going back after 60 years was too much, and that the original classic should be left alone. However, my initial scepticism was dispelled within seconds of the opening sequence. What we have here is a lush, vibrant fusion of animation and music, each fully complimenting the other to perfection. It's hard to pick a favorite sequence, but if really pressed, for personal taste alone, it would be the awesome sequence with the whales. Mickey's Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence is the only carry over from the original, and a worthy match for it in the 2000 lineup is the Donald \"Noah\". The only criticism I have of the film is the bridging sequences, featuring Steve Martin, Penn & Teller, Bette Midler and others. I would have preferred that they stuck to one presenter, preferably James Earl Jones or Angela Landsbury. They seemed to take the material and the project far more seriously than Martin and Penn & Teller who's humor detracted from the dignity of the movie as a whole.",
         "Fantasia 2000 has really been screwed over since it was released in January of the year 2000. I was lucky enough to see it on the IMAX screen. I liked it quite a bit then, but never thought about it much. but for some reason, when it was announced that it would be released on DVD, my interest sparked again, and I got it. now, watching it for the second time, i realize just how amazing it was. it is by far one of the most interesting disney projects ever, probably the best and most unique since the original Fantasia. i will go over and rate and criticize each segment now: 1. \"Symphony #5\" - the battle between good and evil with colorful abstract triangles, unmistakably based on butterflies, being attacked by black triangles in an ethereal setting. this segment did not impress me at all when i originally saw the film, but seeing it again, i am able to appreciate the pastel artistry (the DVD provides a lot of insight on to how difficult it was to create this segment). the segment as a whole may be one of the weakest, but it is very beautiful. possibly the greatness and familiarity of the music diminishes the segment's overall power. it is possibly the single most famous piece of music ever written. 8/10 2. \"Pines of Rome\" - a family of whales fly around in the air. i actually disliked this segment when i first saw the film last january. personally, computer animation used in an animated film always made me cringe. watching it again, i now love the way the cgi whales move and look against the cell animated backgrounds. now i feel that this is maybe the best segment of the film. the music is the best of all. i had never heard it before. the story is also probably the best of them all. it turns out to be one of the most beautiful and miraculous pieces of animation ever created. 10/10 3. \"Rhapsody in Blue\" - several stories of unhappy people are told and intersect in New York City. First off, this is a great piece of music and one of the most unique pieces of animation i have seen. Disney here forgot its attempts at realism and just went for charicatures. it is incredible to see animators create a microcosm of a Robert Altman film as a silent film. This was one of my favorites the first time i saw the film, and it remains so now. 10/10 4. \"Piano Concerto #2, Allegro, Opus 102\" (The Steadfast Tin Soldier) - again, when i first saw the film, I was annoyed at their use of computer animation. now, i see how wonderful this segment really is and how the computer animation works within the beautiful cell animation. the characters in this segment are beautifully made. the tin soldier himself isn't all that impressive, but the ballerina and the jack-in-the-box are amazing creations, among the most effective characters disney has ever created. I love the music in this one, too. i had never heard it before. the only thing i can fault this film for is that the animators changed the ending from a sad or bittersweet ending to a happy one. they claim that the music made them change it, because the music was more upbeat when it ended. this is true, but i also think that they would never have been allowed to end it sadly even if the music had ended so. Disney does not want to depress anyone, and they would slap a happy ending on it no matter what. but, with the music as an excuse, i can accept the ending of the film. 10/10 5. \"Carnival of the Animals, Finale\" - my least favorite segment, when i first saw it and now. it is only about 3 minutes long, and i'm glad for that. i do like it a bit more now, the art, watercolor, anyway. the story is very formulaic, and it follows the annoying tradition of silly disney animal characters like Timon and Pumbaa and Sebastion the crab and so many others. The segment is merely okay, and its shortness provides those children who are bored (the movie wasn't made for them in the first place) to be entertained a little more. 7/10 6. \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" - Who can argue? it is a classic. maybe it shows a little laziness in the filmmakers, to just slap this onto a 65 minute film to pad it to 70 minutes, but who cares. it is wonderful. If you get the DVD, make sure to listen to Mickey Mouse's commetary about this segment. it is awesome. 10/10 7. \"Pomp and Circumstance\" - this may be the most famous of the pieces of music, only competing with Symphony #5, because of its association with graduation. It works surprisingly well with the story of Donald as Noah's assistant who can never find his wife Daisy on the arc and thinks she was left out. Even though they don't acknowledge it anywhere on the DVD, this is obviously based on Buster Keaton's The Naviagator, a silent comedy. This segment ends up being very funny, almost as good as The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and even touching. It is very worthy, even though i know most people blew it off. 10/10 8. \"Firebird Suite - 1919\" - probably the best of the bunch, and the best film to end on. the order of the segments is actually quite well planned out, spacing them out interspersing beauty and whimsy quite well so as to never cross over emotions between two segments. each starts afresh. The Firebird Suite is the story of death and rebirth in nature, with a sprite helping nature to bloom after the winter. she awakes the firebird, a volcano, which destroys all that she has created. at the end, after being destroyed, a majestic elk revives the sprite and she revives nature. the only fault i could think of, and it does harm the film for a few people, is the tremendous similarities between it and Mononoke Hime, Princess Mononoke, which disney distributed last year. I have heard this segment called a rip-off of that film, but, with the tremendously long amount of time it takes to produce an animated piece, i will guarantee that The Firebird Suite was in developement over a year before Mononoke was released. Death and rebirth is such a common theme, it is universal. It is done as well here as it is in Mononoke Hime. 10/10 The interstitials - this is surely the worst part of the film, and it completely diminishes the film's value. We do not need famous people telling us that it is okay to listen to classical music. This is an insult to our intelligence. buy the DVD, and fast-forward over these chapters. 5/10. Overall, 9/10, one of the best films of 2000, one of the most miraculous animated films ever made. It was not well received by critics or audiences, and i think this was a huge mistake. remember, the first fantasia bombed, too. maybe someday in the future, when the minds of Americans become more intelligent and complex again, Fantasia 2000 will get its due.",
         "I can't stop watching it!!! Four of the seven new segments in this film are alone well worth the admission. Roy Disney Jr. sets the stage for a remarkable departure from the usual animated dreck that Disney has been bogged down by for the last half-decade (Toy Story aside). Disney have hereby restored my faith in them as leading the pack in animated cinema. I want more!! \"Pines of Rome\", a marvelous piece set to the \"story\" of whales leaving the water and eventually the planet, is worth viewing several times for it's symbolism and exquisite look. \"Rhapsody in Blue\", by Gershwin, is given perfect treatment by a day in the life of New York City. The pace is quick and manages to give each character studied enough depth to make a very satisfying and touching ending. \"Pomp and Circumstance\", the graduation standard, is humorous and sweet. Creating a love story involving Donald and Daisy Duck into the story of Noah's Ark worked surprisingly well. \"Firebird Suite\"- WOW. This is the most incredible segment of the film. It's a PERFECT marriage of music and animation and MUST be played loud. Very emotional and powerful indeed. I had to post another comment because I can't stress enough that it's a worthy successor to the original Fantasia, and Walt would be proud.",
         "Probably the best animation film I have ever seen. There are no dialogues and it is not really a feature film. It is an assimilation of 8 short stories. The stories are all beautiful, my favorite ones being the one on New York City, \"Rhapsody in Blue\", and the one on life, death and renewal, \"Firebird Suite\". The film is about everything beautiful in life; amazingly entertaining. Each score is given a brilliant visual concept. And the animation speaks so much more than 'real life' films or any dialogues could for that matter. Animation, though usually aimed at kids is probably much more necessary for us adults as we lose that sense of imagination, beauty and observation. Kids are so wonderfully innocent, imaginative and creative; everything that does matter to them has an animated feel to it anyway.",
         "\"Fantasia 2000\" is a beautiful sequel of the classic animation \"Fantasia\" (1940). The conductor is James Levine and each segment is introduced by the actor Steve Martin, the violinist Itzhak Perlman, the actress Bette Midler, the entertainer Penn & Teller, the actor James Earl Jones, the conductor Quincy Jones and the actress Angela Lansbury. The audio is in DTS and THX and the program is the following: (1) Symphony No. 5 in C minor-I. Allegro con brio, by Ludwig van Beethoven. (2) Pines of Rome, by Ottorino Respighi. (3) Rhapsody in Blue, by George Gershwin. (4) Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major-I. Allegro, by Dmitri Shostakovich. (5) The Carnival of the Animals, Finale, by Camille Saint-Saëns. (6) The Sorcerer's Apprentice, by Paul Dukas. (7) Pomp and Circumstance \u0096 Marches 1, 2, 3 and 4, by Edward Elgar. (8) Firebird Suite \u0096 1919 Version, by Igor Stravinsky. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"Fantasia 2000\"",
         "Sixty years after the release of Disney's technicolor classic, Fantasia, comes Fantasia 2000, a brand new animation classic for a whole new generation. Donald W. Ernst brings to the silver screen a sequel of sorts to the Nineteen-forty animation masterpiece, Fantasia. This time around there is a whole new variety of musical sequences, with a a vast array of new characters, including The Steadfast Soldier and the colossal Firebird, as well as the return of everyone's favorite mouse, Mickey, in his unforgettable role as the bumbling Sorcerer's Apprentice. All sequences are accompanied by a beautiful score, performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and conducted by musical genius James Levine. So for an unforgettable visual and musical journey, that will appeal to generations new and old, Disney invites you to visit Fantasia 2000. Fantasia 2000's segments are presented by Disney animated favorites such as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Featured in the presentations is a star-studded live action cast, including Steve Martin, James Earl Jones of Disney's Academy award winning The Lion King, Bette Middler, and the extremely talented Angela Lansbury, who supplied the voice for Mrs.Potts in Disney's hugely popular feature Beauty and the Beast. The list goes on with the impressive names that show up in this film, but again the spotlight is really on the film's animated stars. Fantasia 2000 is certainly a commendable and worthwhile sequel but by no means is it near as impressive as its predecessor. The animation for the film is really something to behold, especially in the film's book-ending sequences Symphony #5, in which a group of stunning whales travel through a beautiful icy ocean, and Firebird, in which the title character spreads a wave of fire throughout the land destroying anything it touches. It also utilizes a unique blend of old and new style animation throughout, but its just seemed to lack the ingenuity and amazement of the first. I realize that in the film they brought back the Sorcerer's Apprentice for fans of the first, but I saw it as nothing more a lack of originality and a time-filler in a film that really could have used a bit more length, especially for the Pomp and Circumstance sequence. My apologies to those who may take offense, but if I wanted to watch Mickey mess up the Sorcerer's palace again I would just go out and rent the original. Yet I must admit the musical pieces donated by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra are spectacular, and do help to elevate this film a few notches. All in all, Fantasia 2000 is a good film, especially so I'm sure for those who caught a viewing of its Eyemax theatrical release. As I have before mentioned it is not as intelligent and original as the first film, and while it should be pointed out that sixty years later it is much harder to be original, I still find Disney could have displayed a bit more creativity and imagination with this effort, but they certainly could have done worse. Now if your family is only capable of traveling to a different world for an hour and half then I would suggest a visit to Fantasia yet if you have an additional hour and a half then venture onward to Fantasia 2000. Overall Rating: 7 out of 10",
         "Having already seen Fantasia and understanding the painstaking work done on the movie, one would have to begin reviewing Fantasia 2000 relatively to the original. There is no question that Walt Disney Animation Studios have a solid tradition of innovation and entertainment. But was it that good? I would start with rating the first segment, the weakest. When I recall the first segment on the original's Tocata and Fugue in D-minor, I was amazed with the intricacy and imagination that went into it. I'm sorry folks, I was not impressed with the beginning of Fantasia 2000. I've listened to the entire first movement of the 5th Symphony before so I was rather disappointed that they shortened the tune a bit. Sorry folks, it just didn't measure up. I was quite disappointed with this piece. It seemed too commercial to my liking. However, I have to say that the animators did a great job in the adaptation of the Pines of Rome. I could not have possibly been any more original myself. The three strongest segments followed. Rhapsody in Blue was a masterpiece. Disney's use of the Steadfast Tin Soldier to the tune of Shostakovich's second Piano Concerto was masterful. And the Carnival of the Animals was funny and brilliant, especially James Earl Jones' introduction. A blast from the past was introduced by Penn and Teller in the form of the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Why? I guess they ran out of ideas at that time. The processions featuring Daisy and Donald Duck was wonderful, along with the Firebird. All in all, it was a good film and it did follow the pattern of the original. I just wish they had a better beginning.",
         "We had two kids at home and I went to rent to one thinking it was a typical Disney movie. I was wrong, but the kids still liked it. I was surprise by the musical choice in this one. Great classical pieces. And the animation is very well done. Some segments better than others. I got to see this one on a regular tv-set, but I guess you should try to see it on an IMAX screen, or at least a cinema screen. Out of 100, I gave it 81. That's good for *** out of ****. Seen at home, in Toronto, on June 15th, 2002.",
         "Top quality animation and a sense of humour make this sequel/add-on a formidable animated movie in its own right. The running time of 74 minutes is a bit of a let-down. I would have liked to have seen more pieces and more imagination. And be warned, The Sorcerer's Apprentice remains. As this was the original's ONLY real selling point they decided to stick it back in there, so you're really only get just over an hours worth of new footage. Which feels like a bit of a rip-off. But my favorite segment is the one with Donald Duck, in fact they were all cool, especially the one with the volcano. The music matches the story perfectly and it has some truly beautiful animation. Far superior to those ugly CGI crap we get these days. And the TV show style introductions were more watchable than the dubbed Deems Taylor segments in the original. This was the first animated movie to be made for IMAX screens and the digital picture is amazing. See this preferably on an IMAX screen or on DVD. Watching it on VHS would only insult the brilliant animation. It's sad that Disney has abandoned traditional hand-drawn animation for theatrical projects. It's what the studio was built on after all. But Disney is shadow of its former self, we all know that. Just as good as the original Fantasia, but loses points for not being longer and more ambitious.",
         "Fantasia 2000 presents us with a visual voyage into music that, in my opinion, excels that of the original Fantasia. Not only is the animation itself extremely fluid, colorful, and highly diverse from segment to segment, but the representation of the music is, in itself, sheer genius. As I have come to expect from Disney, at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure. This much, I believe, is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music. In all, this film is of extremely high value and is of an excellent nature. I highly recommend seeing it on the IMAX screen for full effect of sound and light and to be ready for a sonic experience that will have you whistling tunes all week long."

         "In this update of Disney's masterpiece film mixture of animation and music, new interpretations of great works of music are presented. It begins with an abstract battle of light and darkness set to the music of Beethoveen's Fifth Symphony. Then we see the adventures of a Humpback Whale calf and his pod set to \"The Pines of Rome.\" Next is the humourous story of several lives in 1930's New York City, scored with \"Rhapsody in Blue.\" Following is a musical telling of the fairy tale, \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" set to Dmitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2. Then a goofy Flamingo causes havoc in his flock with his yo-yo to the tune of the finale of \"Carnival of the Animals.\" This is followed by the classic sequence from the original film, \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" starring Mickey Mouse and followed by \"Pomp and Circumstance\" starring Donald Duck as a harried assistant to Noah on his Ark. Finally, we see the awesome tale of the life, death and renewal of a forest in a sequence featuring the composition, \"The Firebird.\"",
