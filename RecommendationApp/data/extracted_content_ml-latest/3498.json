      "synopsis": "October 6, 1970. While on vacation in Istanbul, Turkey, American college student Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) straps several pounds of hashish (about two kilograms) to his body. The film's soundtrack consists of an increasing heartbeat as Billy, nervous at being caught smuggling, makes his way with his girlfriend, Susan (Irene Miracle), through customs. Billy perspires heavily, noticed by the middle aged customs agent who checks his bag. After their bags are searched, both Billy and Susan board a shuttle bus to their plane. Billy smiles, thinking he is out of danger. However, he notices that a large detachment of armed police and soldiers have taken up positions just outside the plane. Unable to detach and discard the hashish, and sweating heavily, Billy is arrested on the spot when he is frisked by a young Turkish policeman. Billy is taken away and back to the terminal and searched, forced to stand around in his underwear. After he is allowed to dress, the Turkish security chief of the airport makes his stand for several press photographs of him holding the confiscated drugs with the smiling customs officers. A little later, Billy meets a man, Tex (Bo Hopkins), from the US Department of State. He tells Billy that the recent terrorist airline hijackings have made the Turks much more fanatical about airport security and that the potency or type of drug that Billy was caught with doesn't matter: the Turkish government wants to appear tough on smuggling. Tex takes Billy to a local police station and is interrogated where Tex translates for a local Turkish detective whom offers Billy freedom if he points out who sold him the hash. The next day, when Billy takes Tex out into an Istanbul bazaar to find the man he bought the hash from, Billy tries to run from his security escort. He is quickly caught by Tex himself, whose previously friendly attitude suddenly changes for the worse. During his first night in holding, Billy sneaks out of his tiny cell and takes a blanket. He is later rousted out of his cell by a large guard named Hamidou (Paul L. Smith), the chief of guards, who takes him to another filthy room, trusses Billy's ankles in the air and hits the soles of his feet repeatedly with his club for stealing the blanket as well as hitting a trustee. Billy's feet swell immensely and he is left in horrific pain. However the next morning, a small group of prisoners, Jimmy (Randy Quaid), an American, Max (John Hurt), an Englishman and Erich, a Swede, get him on his feet and walking (they tell him his feet will continue to swell and his recovery will be longer if he doesn't move around). Jimmy was sentenced for robbing a mosque and Erich was busted for smuggling about 100 grams of hash and given a 12-year sentence. Max has been in prison the longest for drug dealing (seven years and counting) while Erich has already served four years and Jimmy around three. Jimmy tells Billy that the prison is a dangerous place for foreigners like themselves and that no one can be trusted, not even the young children, who are often criminal- and sex slaves for the other imprisoned men. Several weeks later, Billy appears before a local Turkish court before a panel of three judges to hear his case. Billy's father (Mike Kelvin) arrives where he hires him a Turkish lawyer to defend him. But Billy's uninterested lawyer does little to combat the charges brought by an angry prosecutor, who wants Billy charged with more than possession: if Billy is charged with smuggling over mere possession, his sentence will be heavier. After the three judges deliberate for an uncertain amount of time, Billy is sentenced to serve a prison term of four years and two months for possession of hashish at the Samalclar State Prison. Billy and his father appear devastated while his defense lawyer argues that it is a good thing because the judges (sympathetic to Billy) turned down the prosecutor's request to convict Billy for smuggling or impose a life sentence in order to make an example of him. Over the next several months, Billy slowly adjusts to prison life. He is also told about another prisoner named Rifki, who informs on other prisoners for unheard-of privileges and favors and has a special distaste for foreigners. Rifki also steals from his fellow inmates and seems to have an unlimited (for incarceration) supply of money to bribe the poorly paid guards. When Max offends Rifki, the informant kills Max's pet cat. Max tells Billy about the so-called 'midnight express' a code word meaning to escape from prison and how to do it. After a little over two and a half years in the prison, Billy is informed that his case will be reviewed again. Thinking he's being let go early for good behavior, Billy rushes to meet with Stanley Daniels, the representative from the US ambassador's office in the Turkish capital city of Ankara. However, the representative has bad news; the High Court in the Turkish capital of Ankara has heard a different argument from the prosecutor who has appealed the four-year term verdict, and is seeking to charge Billy with smuggling hashish and make an example of him. The so-called double-jeopardy law of U.S. justice does not exist in Turkey. Any accused can be tried more then once for the same crime on appeal or should new evidence surface. At another courtroom hearing, a distraught Billy rails against the three judges, the prosecutor, his own lawyers, the Turkish legal system, and the nation of Turkey itself. Speaking through a translator, with a mixture of anger and pity in his voice, the chief judge tells Billy that his hands are tied by Ankara and has no choice but to give him a life sentence. Billy is given a life sentence of 30 years, with time already served, for smuggling of hashish. In 1974, Billy's friend, Erich, is granted parole and leaves the prison after serving around eight years. Jimmy becomes convinced that he can escape the prison by going over the wall. Billy and Max refuse to join Jimmy, who is caught by the sadistic Hamidou and beaten so badly he suffers a hernia and loses a testicle. When Jimmy recovers and returns, he tells Billy and Max of another plan to escape; the stones used as walls in their section's kitchen are cemented in place with mortar that has weakened greatly in the dank conditions. Jimmy, Billy and Max discover two such stones and are able to remove them, finding a shaft behind them that leads to a system of flooded catacombs under the prison. The three of them spend several nights and hours searching for an escape route, however, it seems the Turks have long since blocked off every tunnel. The three give up and replace the stones, however, Rifki finds their secret in the kitchen and immediately tells Hamidou. Hamidou suspects Jimmy of being responsible and drags him off for punishment and Billy and Max figure out a revenge scheme: they find Rifki's stash of hidden money and destroy it by burning part and boiling the other part. In retaliation, Rifki frames Max for hashish possession. Hamidou has Max dragged off for punishment like Jimmy was. Billy goes berserk and savagely attacks Rifki in the washroom, chasing and beating the traitor until he bites out the man's tongue. In 1975, Billy is sent to the prison's ward for the insane for several months where he wanders in a daze among the other disturbed and catatonic prisoners. His activities seem to consist solely of walking in a circle. One day a prisoner, named Ahmet, talks to him; his words seem restore some of Billy's sanity and he begins to walk in the opposite direction. Billy is visited by Susan who passes him a photo album and tells him it has a picture of his \"good friend, Mr. Franklin, from the bank\". Susan, feeling devastated at Billy's horribly bedraggled state, also opens her blouse so Billy can masturbate. Billy returns to the sanatorium and inspects the book closely, finding several $50 bills hidden inside totaling around $2,000 in cash. Taking the money to Hamidou, he tries to bribe his longtime enemy to take him to the sanatorium that Jimmy had spoken about where the guards are more lax in their duties. Hamidou, chattering about being fed up with Billy, keeps the money and drags Billy to a large dressing room filled with guard uniforms and with pegs set into the walls. Hamidou beats Billy and attempts to rape him when Billy suddenly rushes Hamidou and pushes him forcefully backwards. Hamidou, flailing and trying to regain his footing, slams into the wall, driving a clothes peg into the back of his head, dying instantly. For a short time, Billy considers shooting the dead man with his sidearm but decides not to. He dresses himself in a guard's uniform and reclaiming his money, walks through the prison unnoticed to the front door. As he walks down the stairs, another guard stops him and throws him the keys to the door telling him (in Turkish) to remember to lock up when he checks out. Billy walks out to the street, slowing down only briefly when a police jeep rushes past him. He runs away, the frame freezing on him as he takes a victorious leap. A title card tells us that on the night of October 4, 1975, Billy was able to cross the Turkish border into Greece and flew home to the United States three weeks later. The final shots of the film before the closing credits show Billy reuniting with his family and Susan.",

         "Artistically, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is quite well made... I do recall several media reports at the time of the film's release that led to contrary impressions, supporting the deliberate attempt by the filmmakers to do a hatchet job on the setting of this film. The first was Billy Hayes himself, when he first arrived on native soil, having pulled off his alleged escape; he said on TV, \"I like the Turks...it's the prison I had a problem with\" Easy to understand; few prisons are a joy ride, regardless of nation of origin. From this, I gathered he personally didn't have an animosity against the Turks, although MIDNIGHT EXPRESS goes out of its way to make everything negative about the country and culture. Only the \"Western\" characters are good and attractive, and the folks selected to play the Turks are corrupt, physically ugly and basically sub-human. The exterior scenes in Turkey itself have a grayish tint, implying the land is a hell-hole, and even the near-universally acclaimed cuisine gets a black eye. The second thing from the (film's release) period I recall was a discussion on radio that claimed the prison Billy served time in was relatively modern, built in the mid-sixties... and not the Devil's Island PAPILLON setting depicted in the movie. (A 19th-Century British barracks in Malta was used for the prison.) Naturally, some artistic leeway is allowed here, since the movie's purpose is to paint a picture of a living nightmare. I recall reading the book years ago, and when our hero got his unfair sentence, naturally he was in despair... but at that moment, he felt an almost gallant, resigned acceptance. In contrast, when Billy gave his courtroom speech in the movie (which certainly was a defining moment of the film's ill-naturedness... to quote part of the speech: \"For a nation of pigs, it sure seems funny that you don't eat them! Jesus Christ forgave the bastards, but I can't! I hate! I hate you! I hate your nation! And I hate your people! And I f**k your sons and daughters because they're pigs! You're all pigs!\"), the three ugly judges actually hung their heads in shame. I wonder if there's a courtroom in any nation that would permit such a prolonged and loud outburst. The August 30th post mistakenly referred to Turkey as an Arab nation.... so the user must not have seen \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" where the Arabs were the heroes and the Turks were the villains. It's interesting that in the rare Hollywood film where Arabs are portrayed \"positively,\" Turks still come across as barbaric. A Turkish-American friend has told me, contrary to what others here are thinking that the film couldn't really prejudice the viewer, that the film has achieved one of its purposes, to leave a sore, anti-Turkish taste in mouths. Keeping in mind that Americans are generally ignorant of the ways of many foreign nations, this film continues, even today, of being the only source of information most Americans have about Turkey. As cinematically effective and wonderfully made this film is, there's a disturbing side to MIDNIGHT EXPRESS that makes it mildly resemble a contemporary \"Jude Suess,\" or THE ETERNAL JEW (\"Der Ewige Jude\").",
         "I like this movie a lot. I believe it is well done and is a movie that can be watched several times. However, as a person who has spent time in Turkey and read the book upon which the film is based, I know that it is a fictional story. It begins with a caption \"a true story\" but the only thing true about this movie is that someone named Billy Hayes was caught trying to smuggle a lot of hashish out of the country and was sent to jail. The events that supposedly happened to him in prison are fictional. I'm not saying that being in a Turkish prison is a good thing but the brutality presented is just plain fiction. Before you feel sorry for this guy remember that he was trying to smuggle drugs for re-sale in the US. Before you condemn Turkey remember that at the time Turkey was being pressured by the world community, particularly by the US, to do something about the drug flow coming out of the country. This is one movie that infuriates the Turkish government whenever it is shown and I believe rightly so because it caters to the notion that Turkey is some type or barbaric nation with a population that is incapable of human emotion or decency. Having lived in Turkey I know this to be totally false. In addition, with the exception of the skyline of Istanbul in the opening scene, none of the movie was filmed in Turkey. All of the Turks portrayed in the film, with the exception of the prosecutor, are Italian actors. The language spoken in the movie is not even Turkish for the most part. There are some phrases which are indeed Turkish but the majority of what is spoken is some other language. As I said however, I like this movie, in the same way that I like Star Trek; a great story but fiction none the less.",
         "I can't believe that so many reviews of Midnight Express have degenerated into exchanges of opposing political views that skirt over the film itself. While this may be based on a true story, like any good filmmaker, the director Alan Parker has shown the shades of gray here. The film's message, as far as any fair-minded viewer should discern it, is that the individual and the state (whether one's own or a foreign country) exist in a fragile state of consent with each other which requires fair and proportional responses on both sides. Neither side is totally in the right or the wrong here in Parker's film. Billy Hayes is not a guiltless, red-blooded hero here and Parker doesn't portray him as such. Hayes committed what would have been a crime in any country-- smuggling heroin-- and he was caught and rightfully prosecuted. He has broken laws and must pay the price. Just to be on the safe side-- -------------MINOR SPOILERS HERE----------------------- Hayes is initially handed a sentence by the Turkish court-- approximately 4 years-- that would probably be considered fair in any civilised society for his activities. The prison is tough (it's not supposed to be a cakewalk), but Hayes accepts his punishment and overall stays out of trouble while in the prison. Then, with little more than two months left in his term, and the prospect of release dangling before him, a higher Turkish court-- for obscure and apparently contrived reasons (making someone an example)-- suddenly comes back basically saying he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison for his one earlier slip. At this point the moral compass, as it may be, shifts to Billy. He's done his time, he's behaved, he's accepted his punishment and it's hardships, and suddenly the rug is pulled out from under him. To all the hot-bloods here who say Hayes was a rich American who deserved what he got-- have you ever heard of the concept of proportionality in law? Hayes did not commit a violent crime against anybody (both in terms of his initial act and up to the time the appellate court extended his sentence), he did not even commit a property crime like stealing or burglary. This is what Parker is saying-- Hayes was in the wrong for smuggling and was justly punished for those four years, but the arbitrary extension of his sentence close to his release, and the sheer length of the term (pretty much a lifer), are grossly disproportionate and unbecoming of a civilised society. In many if not most countries, even many killers are usually sentenced to far less than the 30 years that were suddenly tacked onto Hayes's term, and they don't experience the sort of sadistic torture meted out by the wardens in the jail in this film. It had the stink of scapegoating, and the rest of the film shows Hayes's desperate attempts to survive and escape a system that has become corrupt. For what it's worth, I'm not an American and I don't in any way harbor illusions of superiority on the part of the West or East. One might make similar criticisms of things like the \"3 Strikes Law\" in the USA which are also pretty arbitrary. Parker isn't commenting on which civilization(s) is/are superior-- he's saying that there are some universal civil liberties that any civilised society should strive to, and societies both west and east fail when they deny them to the most vulnerable people, namely those sent to prison and stripped of even the freedom to mix with the general population. And note, furthermore, that the Turks in the prison (the vast majority) suffer as much as the foreigners. (BTW, to the commentators who've stupidly claimed that this film is merely \"American propaganda\"-- Alan Parker is British. If you're going to hurl an accusation like that, at least get such a basic fact straight.) BTW I've been to Turkey and I've found the Turks to be among the world's most generous and kind people, esp to strangers. And sometimes I do wish that Parker had included more Turkish characters with more agreeable qualities, which (even in a prison) one would be likely to find (and I also found the \"comparison to pigs\" comment in the courtroom to be inappropriate). But Parker wanted to make this a gritty film with an air of desperation throughout, and for this reason alone one should be careful about extending what's seen in this film to the Turks as a whole.",
         "It's interesting to note the comments on this movie. I saw it on TV last night, not for the first time, and I noticed how the Turks in the film are all one-dimensional bad people, and physically ugly to boot. I also read that many of the scenes are completely fictional. I am not one of those people who think that a \"true\" story must be completely true; I think that the purpose of movies is to entertain, and this one certainly does that, if in a harrowing way. But, given the politics of our time, if the author of the screenplay wanted to create a demon people for dramatic effect, perhaps it would have been better to have set the story in a fictional or unidentified country. The other observation I would make is, we are not much better than they are. We regularly sentence people to ungodly amounts of prison time for drug offenses, both on a state and federal level. Our prisons are no picnic, either, with many of the same sorts of things that were portrayed in the movie happening right here at home. So, go check \"the man in the mirror\" before you condemn anyone else.",
         "Wow. This was disturbing. I live in Nottingham, I have many Turkish friends who study here. If I didn't know them, I'd probably think that there wasn't a single Turk who is nice and pleasant... Some parts were actually funny. The judge (in Billy's hate monologue scene) was sounding exactly like Jabba the Hutt! I've heard people speak Turkish around me, so I knew the language which was supposed to be Turkish in the movie, wasn't. Come on people... Feels like this movie was made to make Turks look bad in every way possible. I've read an interview and I learnt that the real Billy Hayes was truly disappointed with the portrayal of Turkish people in the film. Anyway, this movie was fun to watch but would be ignorant to believe. Have a good one",
         "This movie claims to be based on a true story but just like many other Hollywood productions, it warps the truth to an unrecognizable mess. If you want to hear the real story behind the movie, you should see the interview with the real \"Billy Hayes\" on YouTube at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TweU77cDrgE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqPMI6BnINI&mode=related&search The real \"Billy Hayes\" even says that he'd like to go back to Turkey to visit Istanbul. Now that's a slap on the face of the producers of the movie who have demonized all Turks for their personal gain of a statue. They would have received more Oscars if they portrayed the events in realistic terms as \"Billy\" explains in the interview. In my opinion, the story of how the real \"Billy\" made it to the border after he ran away from the prison, would make a wonderful action/adventure movie. Of course, that's where the movie ends, having achieved its purpose of slandering a complete nation. Down with Hollywood!! Long live YouTube for giving a voice to the suppressed truth!",
         "I can't for the life of me, understand those that think the idiocy, the blatant racism, the retarded angle with which A WHOLE NATION OF 70 MILLION PEOPLE! are portrayed as subhuman pigs in this film would have anything to do with being \"artistic\" or \"true story\" etc... Turkey takes millions of tourists every year, that go there on their own free will, again and again, millions and millions of western tourists for chrissakes! How in the world could this dumb movie have anything to do with reality?! It is just simply amazing and telling of our times that this racist filth is taken seriously and rated so high to boot! Well done idiots!",
         "While this film is entertaining to watch and has its level of suspense at various points it is not a truly `true story' much of it according to the real Billy Hayes never happened and his eventual escape is very different from what is depicted in this motion picture. It also tends to demonize the nation of Turkey and presents a distorted view of its people. Is it possible to have sympathy for the main character? He was fully aware of what he was doing and knew the consequences should he be caught so sympathy is on an individual basis. You may have sympathy or may not. A number of years ago a public service commercial narrated by actor Hal Holbrook frequently ran on Television, which told of Americans being held in foreign prisons. He spoke of one American held in a Turkish prison. Was it Billy Hayes? The commercial ends with the line `When you're busted for drugs over there you're in for the hassle of your life' That's the message this film was intended to send out irregardless if the events in it were true or fictionalized for dramatic purposes. As always purchase or rent a copy to see the uncut unedited version.",
         "As a Turkish citizen I came to the US this year to study. After several persons asked me about this movie, I decided to watch it. I am not a nationalist at all. I have never been proud (or ashamed) of being a Turkish as i wouldn't be proud (or ashamed) of being a member of another nationality. It would be absurd to deny that there was and is torture in many prisons in Turkey, especially to political prisoners. Justice system is not perfect either. Yet, i have been very disturbed by this movie. It is full of racism and hatred. At one point, the actor speaks of Turks as a nation of pigs. All the Turkish people in the movie are portrayed as ugly evils. Some reviewers say that if you forget about the propaganda, it is a good movie. Other than the acting by the main character, i didn't see what makes this movie a good one. The screenplay is very simplistic and unrealistic. Simple good against simple bad. Nothing about the complexities of human nature or social life. It is unbelievable that this movie has won so many awards. And it is a shame that such big names as Oliver Stone and Alan Parker have their signatures on this crap.",
         "I have to be fair, the movie does what it's supposed to and that's giving the audience a horrific thrill ride. You'll spend your time watching the movie in sheer horror and at the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. As with all Oliver Stone movies such as Salvador, Born On The Fourth Of July and Platoon, Midnight Express is brutal and merciless. Oliver Stone it seems, has made a habit of making money and getting Oscars from controversial and/or little known events in history and dramatizing on it to a point of making the story haunting. The only downside is, for the sake of awards and \"art\", a culture was demonized beyond redemption and any limits over a fictional story (Oliver Stone himself wrote the story for the movie). *The following is not a spoiler from the movie but points out an event from the plot* In reality, William Hayes it turns out, was arrested at the Turkish airport for trying to smuggle packs of drugs attached on his body into the U.S., and he was held for a time before being given to the American authorities for deportation. William Hayes and Oliver Stone themselves it turns out, have already apologized to the Turkish people for the overly dramatized and fictional parts of the movie and the book. It's funny actually how a movie can create so much on a true moment in life to a point of fiction and still call it a true story. The Turks don't get any breaks in the movie. All their people, cops, judges, lawyers and inmates are shown in such extreme way as ugly, merciless, demonic and sadistic people that one who knows nothing about Turkey would think that its population consists of demons and ugly merciless sadists. Actually this can be compared to movies which have been made about the Russians in the past which always seem to show the Russian women as ugly people with facial hair and nothing attractive while in reality, Beautiful Russian women dominated the modeling business in the world. While apologies have been made, the damage has already been done on the image of the Turkish people. People who are anti-Turkish love praising this movie and insisting that it's a true story all the way while the Turks keep getting rightfully offended. Be aware however, that %80 or some more of this movie is purely fictional. Even just logic would tell you that at a time where the U.S. and Turkey had such strong relations during the cold war, something like what is shown in the movie would have been unthinkable by the Turkish authorities. For a person who just wants to watch a good thriller movie and doesn't care nor wants to get involved in any dramatic flame wars or political discussions on this board or any other, it's worth watching at least once. If you don't like the movie, at least you'll see what all this fuss has been about over the years since the movie was shown in the theaters. Keep the pop-corns popping' and the good movies rolling' :D"

         "On October 6, 1970 while boarding an international flight out of Istanbul Airport, American Billy Hayes is caught attempting to smuggle 2 kilos of hashish out of the country, the drugs strapped to his body. He is told that he will be released if he cooperates with the authorities in identifying the person who actually sold him the hash. Billy's troubles really begin when after that assistance, he makes a run for it and is recaptured. He is initially sentenced to just over four years for possession, with no time for the more harsh crime of smuggling. The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense, with a sadistic prison guard named Hamidou ruling the prison, he who relishes the mental and physical torture he inflicts on the prisoners for whatever reason. Told to trust no one, Billy does befriend a few of the other inmates, namely fellow American Jimmy Booth (in for stealing two candlesticks from a mosque), a Swede named Erich, and one of the senior prisoners having already served seven years, an Englishman named Max, the latter two also in for hash related charges. One prisoner not befriended is Rifki, who wields power in the prison as the unofficial eyes and ears for the guards. As Billy, his family and his girlfriend Susan attempt through legal and diplomatic channels for Billy's release, Max tells him that the only way out is to \"catch the midnight express\" aka escape, which is what Jimmy is continually trying to do. When Billy's situation changes, he becomes more desperate in every sense of the word. It seems as if Billy has only two options: to let the prison ultimately figuratively then literally kill him, or to somehow regain control of his life through whatever means available.",
         "On October 6, 1970, American college student Billy Hayes is caught attempting to smuggle drugs out of Turkey. The Turkish courts decide to make an example of him, sentencing him to more than 30 years in prison. The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense, with a sadistic prison guard named Hamidou ruling the prison, he who relishes the mental and physical torture he inflicts on the prisoners for whatever reason. Hayes has two opportunities for release: the appeals made by his lawyer, his family, and the American government, or the \"Midnight Express\".",
