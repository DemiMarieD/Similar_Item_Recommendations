      "reviews": ["I just got done watching this. It has 3 short stories over about an hour and a half. If you're a Paul Bowles fan then you will of course like renting this. The DVD also contains interviews of Bowles' personal friends and helpers in life talking about him after his death. I enjoyed this as well. I think it was about 35-40 minutes or so. The three stories are acted out very well. They do a good job in adapting the short stories he wrote onto the screen. If you want to get a feel of life in Tangier, Morocco this will throw you right into the middle of life there. I liked it in the first story they're in a crummy place playing fooz ball and there's Terminator, Commando, and Rambo III posters hanging on the wall. This was neat to see as it helped me place a time setting to compare with what my life was like at that particular time period. Good luck and I hope you enjoy! If you don't, don't blame me ; )"],
