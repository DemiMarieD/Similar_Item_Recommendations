         "content": "Uxoricide!\r\n\r\nI Saw What You Did is directed by William Castle and written by William P. McGivern. It stars John Ireland, Joan Crawford, Leif Erickson, Andi Garrett, Sara Lane and Sharyl Locke. Music is by Van Alexander (Joseph Gershenson supervising) and cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc. \r\n\r\nWhen two teenagers on babysitting duties decide to have fun making prank phone calls, their evening turns sinister when they call up a man who has just murdered his wife\u2026 \r\n\r\nWilliam Castle was of course better known for his gimmicks than for his ability as a film maker, I Saw What You Did shows the best and worst of the great entertainer. Castle produces and directs this one so is accountable for getting the mix completely wrong. At times the picture is genuinely suspenseful, the premise at the core superb, but at others it feels like it wants to be a comedy, further compounded by Alexander\u2019s awful musical score. It\u2019s a score that belongs in something like Bewitched or The Munsters, and quite often takes you out of the thriller zone. \r\n\r\nCastle unsurprisingly borrows off of some films that influenced his career, but aided by McGivern\u2019s screenplay he manages to put some different spins on the twisty plot developments. It also helps having Biroc (The Killer that Stalked New York/Cry Danger/The Garment Jungle) on photography duty, he\u2019s able to make Castle\u2019s fog scenes appear icy cold, to blend the shadows into the story like foreboding prowlers. \r\n\r\nCast wise the elder cast members aren\u2019t stretching themselves here, with Crawford working for food and Ireland on auto-pilot, but the younger actors are great fun and really nail that naivety of youth thing to the max. All told it\u2019s a fun film, if not always for the right reasons. With some Castle invention (eyelet vision?!) and steals \u2013 and Biroc on form, there\u2019s more than enough here to compensate for the confusing mix of genres. 6/10",

         "That's what the poster ads warned! UXORICIDE! (look it up). William Castle's \"I Saw What You Did\" is a great little suspense drama, with a perky cast and an intriguing story. Left alone one night while their parents are out of town, teen-aged Libby, her little sister Tess, and Libby's visiting friend Kit amuse themselves by making crank phone calls. They especially enjoy crooning \"I saw what you did and I know who you are\" to their victims. Unfortunately, one of their calls hits the bullseye--a homicidal maniac who has just murdered his wife. Tense and atmospheric, with delightful performances from Andi Garrett, Sarah Lane and Sharyl Locke as the kids, and strong ones from John Ireland as the psychopath, and the one-and-only Joan Crawford (straight from Castle's \"Strait-Jacket\") as his blackmail-minded neighbor, who's inexplicably in love with him. Though her part is a supporting one, just try to look away when she's on screen. A word, too, for the beautiful photography-no mean achievement in a low-budget film. Anchor Bay Entertainment released the movie on DVD and VHS back in 1999. The picture quality is sensational. Also included are two fun '' Teaser Trailers'' -one featuring Castle himself. Though the DVD is not ''anmorphic'' it is in Widescreen with no scratches or blemishes anywhere.It must have been taken from the original Universal negative.The one-channel soundtrack is equally strong, though a good DVD system will allow you to upgrade to two-channel,''Simulated Stereo'' which sounds even better. The Trailers are as well preserved as the film itself. Sadly, it's long out of print, and goes for big $$ on Amazon and EBAY. The 1988 Television remake is terrible. Avoid it and stick with the original!",
         "...which is a no-budget thriller. Two teenage girls (Sara Lane, Andi Garrett) make prank phone calls saying the title line. By mistake they call Steve Marak (John Ireland) who's just killed his wife. Then things get out of control. One of William Castle's low budget horror films that he churned out in the 1960s. None of them are that good but this is definitely one of the better ones. It's photographed in moody black & white and director Castle makes excellent use of darkness (notice all the darkness above the girls when they make the calls) and shadows and fog (which inexplicably shows up at the end). There's also a very vicious shower stabbing in the first 20 minutes with shots obviously imitating \"Psycho\". There are also quite a few good moments calculated to make you jump. On the debit side--there's not enough story even for 83 minutes; Joan Crawford (dressed to the 9s for no reason) is wasted as a next-door neighbor; Ireland is stone-faced throughout; Lane and Garrett are horrible actresses (and, tellingly, never made another movie) and the script has lines that no teenager would utter. Still, there are worse ways to kill 90 minutes and the jolts in this film do work. Worth seeing if you're a horror fan.",
         "This was a hugely entertaining movie, with some TRUE moments of suspense. I thought that Joan Crawford, as usual, gave a magnificent performance. My only regret was that she had a supporting role and therefore had limited screen time. Now that this has finally been released on video for the first time, it should provide Joan's fans with countless hours of entertainment. Joan proves once again, that she is beautiful at any age...in this flick, she was 57 and gorgeous!",
         "and she knows who you are! This is another strange William Castle concoction that features Joan Crawford in one of the B-horror movies she made near the end of her career, and yet the only way they could fit her into this story was to make her a kooky neighbor lady who wears tacky jewelry that looks like some sort of bizarre Aztec armor. Everyone knows the plot, which involves two teenage girls who spend an evening making prank phone calls and, through the miracle of plot contrivance, stumble into the path of a psychotic man who has just committed murder. I don't know if any of the other viewers felt the same way, but I really think the movie's violence is a bit shocking for its day. The first murder is an ironic ripoff of \"Psycho\", with the person in the shower committing the murder instead of being slashed, and I was surprised at how graphic it really is. Also, I don't know whether this was really the filmmakers' intention or not, but they have captured the excitement of a teenage adventure and carried it effortlessly into a suspenseful conclusion. Ironically, the only thing in the movie that feels wrong is the subplot involving Crawford. It was obviously inserted to give the movie a star and to pad out the running time.",
         "(POSSIBLE SPOILER) This is a classic b-movie from 1965.The B&W cinematography is beautiful and effective - mucho fog and fake scares but the basic premise - that of kids making prank calls and it coming back to terrify them is truly effective. I saw this when I was quite little and it scared the heck out of me. In fact, this and Snow White are two of my earliest film memories (and Joan Crawford is STILL creepier than the Evil Queen in Snow White). Joan actually has fun as a nasty, scene-stealer neighbor who wants the married man for herself. William Castle (I'm a big fan of his) made many effective, cheapo thrillers: Dr. Sardonicus, Homicidal & Thirteen Ghosts (to name a few). In fact, John Goodamn does a nice job playing a version of Castle in the underrated Joe Dante film, Matinée. But check out this little teenage scarefest and whatever you do - don't prank call someone right after they've killed a mate - they're not in the mood!!",
         "This is a William Castle film and has all the earmarks of a made for the drive-in movie--crappy teen music, teen actors and lots of violence (for its day). However, despite this it's still a pretty good film with some occasionally chilling moments. The best aspects of the film are the excellent realistic performance by John Ireland as a menacing murderer, Joan Crawford's decent performance in which she is murdered before she gets a chance to over-act, and the creepy conclusion where the girls are chased about the property by the madman--all really good stuff. But, in between the beginning and the end, the movie drags a bit--and some of it is due to the fact that the two teenagers who star in the film just don't have enough magnetism to sustain the film. Plus, although I hate to admit it, they were both such brats I was kind of hoping they WOULD be killed! The other low-point of the film is the crappy beach party-type music at the beginning and end. It was totally inappropriate for the mood of the film but I assume it was used to appeal to the younger audience--while probably alienating older viewers or people in the 21st century that view the DVD. Not a bad little film, but hardly great or memorable.",
         "Yes, good old William Castle is on the loose again, with a low budget and a creepy plot...and Joan Crawford, whose salary probably used up most of Castle's available cash. You know you're in trouble from the first few scenes, with corny eyeball-shaped framing devices, then the intrusion of Van Alexander's completely out-of-place bouncy score, with its recurring principal theme of \"Ninny nanny noo-noo.\" (Most of his credits are for 60s sitcoms, and it shows.) Then we're treated to exteriors of the Mannering house which are nothing more than Thomas Kincade- style paintings. (Virtually the whole film was shot on a sound stage, except for some rear projections.) The plot itself is clichéd, but decently \"executed.\" The casting is a problem, with Joan Crawford at age 60 trying to be the hypotenuse in a love triangle between 50-year-old John Ireland and some young bimbo (or we should say, ex-bimbo). Not much choice there. The two teenage girls are straight out of 60s sitcom land, and the younger sister joins the ranks of \"most annoying child actors.\" There are some tense moments, including a ripoff of the shower scene from \"Psycho\" (except with a naked man instead of Janet Leigh). And since we're already knee-deep in 60s sitcoms with the trite score and giggly teenaged actors, we're given an ending that would have been right in place on Dobie Gillis or the Patty Duke Show. Except with a dead body.",
         "Kids left alone in the house inadvertently play a phone prank on psychopath John Ireland, who has just murdered his trampy Mrs. in the shower! Whenever you see a biography of Joan Crawford's career, this title usually gets left out. True, she has a minor role in it (playing Ireland's neighbor, hoping to blackmail him into marriage), however it's one of the better movies she was involved in after \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\" William Castle did a good job as producer/director of this story, and the two teenage girls are very appealing and natural. The movie builds some credible suspense (underlined with a jokey tone) and has interesting visual tricks and groovy music. Avoid the awful, too-literal 1988 TV-remake. **1/2 from ****",
         "What do you say when terror calls? Just the average \"hello,\" or something more terrified? I'm sorry to say Joan does seem a bit stewed. She acts like a marvelous actress on a binge caught unawares. Her part is miniscule, but she gives it her off-kilter all. John Ireland is here, 10 years after being stung by Joan in \"Queen Bee,\" which everyone has already mentioned. That film was infinitely scarier than this one, with Joan stopping just short of eating babies. Ooh, she was a bad one. In this film she's a bad one of a different sort--bad as in \"not good.\" Kit and Libby are the two silly acting teenagers that decide prank phone calls are a lovely way to spend an evening. They have several routines, but I don't remember hearing, \"Is your refrigerator running?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then you better go catch it.\" I guess they decided against using the classics. They go from mocking people (\"Is this John Hamburger?\") to girlfriend-accidentally-calls-wife skits (\"Is --insert name-- there? Oh, this is his wife?!?\"). When their creativity runs out (after about two phone calls) they decide to use a planned line--\"I saw what you did and I know you are.\" Well, William Castle asks, what if the person you called actually did something and he thinks you saw him? Interesting idea--presumably taken from the book on which this film is based. Turns out, they ring up John Ireland, who has just committed a felony, and he thinks he had witnesses. Libby is the one that falls for him, I think, and she just gets all hot and bothered. She decides that she has to see a man that has a sexy voice like that, why, he must be just divine. She really fell hard--I felt sorry for her. She said his voice was something like him running his fingers up and down her spine. What has this girl been reading? She gets so frustrated (Freud's type of frustrated, I imagine) that she goes over to his house just to peek in the window. She gets all dressed up to do this, does her hair and puts on makeup, and the other girl (Kit?) is understandably confused. Libby is stomping on the flowers when she meets Amy, the drunken, sex-crazed, incredibly angry and pathetic neighbor. At this point, things pick up considerably. We've got the rantin' and ravin' of Joan, the stammering and completely terrified girl, and John \"Sexy Voice\" Ireland. All our characters have reported for duty, and the plot has emerged. Everything is ready to go. I think this is where the film reaches its own little pinnacle of greatness. Joan confronts John (didja know there was also a John Crawford back then?) with the a bunch of incorrect information, but it's just enough to get him riled. From this point on, everyone's in trouble and who can save them now? All in all, a very enjoyable film, although I don't think it's too terribly frightening. (Joan's hair is scary, as I think someone else mentioned, but that's about it.) It's what one would expect from William Castle. Laughs in a Halloween costume.",
         "I saw this as a young girl and it really scared me then, I watched it again recently as an adult and it still has some suspenseful moments. You all know the story, 2 teenage girls spending the night without parental supervision decide to make prank phone calls, and damn the luck, they accidentally prank a murderer. Of course it gets really scary and dumb after that. In real life what teenager would actually try and meet the person they prank phone called? And then there's the aging, drunken Joan Crawford in a small but memorable role as a sex crazed neighbor. The plot is pretty weak, but overall it's a fun movie to watch on a rainy Saturday night."
