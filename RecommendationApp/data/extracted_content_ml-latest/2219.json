         "One of the most conventional stories Hitchcock ever filmed, this is an innovative early curio full of clever moments, a vibrant feature that overwhelms its intelligent but lifeless (and dated) script. It is not a match for the stunning BLACKMAIL, but it is a worthy followup after the less interesting JUNO & THE PAYCOCK. Sir John's quest to clear the woman he helped convict of murder charges takes a familiar whodunit path, but the performances help make this a unique film. All credit goes to Hitchcock for crafting another visually arresting movie and for knowing precisely how to tell the tale without overreaching (something he accomplished even in his weakest movies). You'd expect that this movie, full of pioneering experiments, would feel like an antique; so many of the things it attempts have become tired clichés, yet the actors and director ensured that MURDER! would retain a freshness that is potent even now. Without revealing too much, the sequence that really stays with you occurs near the end of the picture at a circus. This climactic, dark scene will leave you reeling in disbelief. Each time I see it I come away wondering how he managed something so remarkable -- and in a sense, terrifying -- to wrap up this Agatha Christie-like plot. Hitchcock's brightest years are ahead of him at this point, but the circus scene may be a career highlight. The director disliked \"whodunit\" stories due to their rigid structure and the lack of opportunities for suspense, and admittedly this story is not as exciting as THE LODGER or BLACKMAIL, but he does milk the plot for all that it's worth and I think most anyone would be entertained by it. For Hitchcock buffs, this is a must, and thanks to the copious experimentation it's also recommended to anyone who is interested in early sound cinema.",
         "Early Hitchcocks are all worth seeing to observe how the Master's style evolved over the years. This story, based on a Clemence Dane book, is interesting, if only for the sub-texts flowing through it. The dialogue comes in fits and starts, which is common in the early sound films and some of the camera work is rudimentary.....but you can still spot the Hitchcock touch in the nuances of some of the scenes. Herbert Marshall is especially dashing as Sir John; he was a particularly attractive actor in his early years. Nora Baring is servicable as the accused but it is Esme Percy, as Fain, who is intriguing. As a \"half-caste\", originally written by Dane as gay, he is either overacting like hell or is fascinating in his interpretation....there is a fine line. Regardless, he holds your attention when he is on the screen. The film moves slowlllllllly, very slowlllllly.....but for Hitchcock and early talkie buffs, it is well worth it. Catch Una O'Conner in her younger years as the landlady. She's a treat.",
         "This was one of the few times that Alfred Hitchcock filmed one of his stories as a \"whodunit\" in which you are not sure until the end who committed the crime. \"Murder!\" is often slow-moving, but it has some good features, and is worth watching the whole way through. It was one of Hitchcock's earliest sound pictures, and he tried some new things here, some of which work quite well. Herbert Marshall stars as Sir John, a famous actor who sits on a jury for a murder case. After the case is decided, Sir John starts having second thoughts over whether the verdict was really correct, and he decides to investigate on his own. His investigation itself moves rather slowly, but it has some entertaining moments. Everyone connected with the murder was part of a theater group, and Hitchcock gets some good mileage out of having the characters alternate between their real identities and their stage roles. There are some pretty good scenes, most especially the one of the jury's deliberations - it is quite amusing, and a not-too-subtle example of Hitchcock's lack of confidence in the infallibility of the legal system. There is not very much of the suspense for which Hitchcock is famous, but instead there is some subtle humor and a lot of atmospheric detail. While not having the sustained excitement of Hitchcock's best films, \"Murder!\" is still worthwhile as a slightly different kind of film by the great director.",
         "\"Murder\" is a film imprisoned by its time (the early sound period) and place (Britain before the era of the classless society), and largely because of that, quite enjoyable. As the generic title suggests, you have a murder, a locked-room whodunnit of humble origin that would be pretty much not remembered today if it wasn't an early sound effort by the Master himself, Alfred Hitchcock. An opening shot is particularly effective, as we witness a reaction to a cry of murder (in the entire movie we never see any murder actually take place) along a row of second-story tenement apartments along a night-darkened sidestreet. \"A highbrow shocker,\" it is called by its chief protagonist, Sir John Menier, and it is sort of that, not that it's an especially complex mystery but represents an early effort by a sophisticated directorial mind. The acting is stilted but effective throughout, particularly the great Herbert Marshall as the lead character, Sir John. Not many films made so early in the 1930s offered such magnetic figures to gravitate around. Marshall is quite charming and plummy as the one man committed to seeing justice is done in the case of a woman who has been, he suspects unfairly, convicted of committing the title deed. You feel Sir John's pain, and enjoy his company, and that's unusual when you consider the fact movie characters spoke only via subtitles less than 18 months before. I like the mise-en-scenes, particularly one that takes place in a jury room and another one that takes place backstage during a play. The acting isn't always sharp, but the characterizations are, and Hitchcock really allows us to distinguish among many minor roles. Critics today have noted the attendant snobbery of the film, particularly the way working-class characters unfailingly defer to the noble Sir John. But Marshall is so good you root for his character even despite the class angle. He's so obviously full of good intentions and sensitive to others. Despite a penetrating wit, he's bears a real conscience. You can't help but identify with him in some way. \"I found myself caught up in a machine,\" he confesses to Mr. Markham, who along with Markham's wife he enlists on a crusade to prove the condemned woman innocent. Actually, I think it's nice having a movie that speaks in favor of Britain's class system; it's easy to do otherwise today, but this period picture usefully exemplifies the predominant thinking of the time. Plus the Markhams [Phyllis Konstam and Edward Chapman] are effective as comic relief, and well-taken care of by Sir John as we discover at the movie's end. Sir John is so considerate, well-bred, and decent that we kind of root for him despite his airs. Maybe we wouldn't resent Britain's noble classes if they all behaved so well. The way he puts Mr. Markham at ease (\"Ah, yes, I anticipate your objection,\" he says as Markham struggles to keep up with the conversation) is one of many subtle humorous sections in the movie. Also, Hitchcock does take pains to bring Sir John down to size, for example by having the lord spend the night at a policeman's house to get some intelligence on the murder case. There he must content with a morning wake-up call from an affectionate cat who crawls under the covers of his bed, and a huggy toddler who won't let go of her new daddy. Marshall makes us like his character by showing us his humanity, here and elsewhere, and the result is a scene that's charming and rich. (Also cut in many versions, unfortunately.) Hitchcock was very British, but no snob. SPOILER ALERT [Does anyone watch a movie from 1930 expecting to be surprised by plot twists?] The killer in this movie is a fellow named Handel Fane, who fears his dark secret, that of being half-black, will be exposed. Actually, Fane is as black-looking as Robert Smith of the Cure, and critics are nearly uniform in saying his actual unaddressed secret deals with homosexuality. Esme Percy as Fane comes across as gay as a French horn at Mardi Gras. But Fane killed the victim because he didn't want the convicted killer to know he was in love with her, so that's that for the gay angle. Still, Percy's fey mannerisms are offputting. So is the thick acting of Norah Baring as Diana Baring, a performance only notable in that her character has the same last name as the actress playing her. A good film when you make allowances for the time, but when you do, you can really get swept up in it. Hitchcock doesn't so much shine here as show an awareness of inner motives and psychology that would stead him well in time. A good movie mostly for discerning the genius to follow, but it does have its moments that shine even today. Watch it without great expectations, and you will be pleasantly surprised.",
         "Alfred Hitchcock's Murder! is not a great film, but I give it *** out of ****, so it must be good, and it is. The acting is good, the premise is intriguing, but the film being extremely slow-moving, makes the film boring at times, but it is still at times a quite mesmerizing film that is worth is just for the extraordinary ending. The plot deals with a woman( Norah Baring) being accused of murder, and a juror( a great Herbert Marshall) being almost sure that she is not the killer, and attempting to find this killer. I will not reveal any more of the plot to you, as I think that this film deserved to be seen, not just read. It is not one of Hitchcock's more popular films, and not one of his best. It is an early talkie, so be prepared for a poor print. But past that and it's slow-moving flaws, it's a well-acted film that deserves to be seen.",
         "Whenever I review one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser-revered pre-1940 British efforts, I always find myself falling back upon an old cliché. Each time, in no uncertain terms, I declare that that, within this film, regardless of its cinematic merits (or lack thereof), one can detect the makings of a genius. At least in the case of 'Murder! (1930),' I can say this with complete confidence, since, though the film is rather ponderous between the interesting beginning and the thrilling ending, the director's aptitude for technical inventiveness is undeniably present. The film, one of Hitchcock's first talkies after he revolutionised British cinema with 'Blackmail (1929)' was based upon the novel \"Enter Sir John,\" written by Clemence Dane and Helen Simpson. Unlike the \"wrong man\" scenario that would become Hitchcock's trademark, 'Murder!' involves the \"wrong woman,\" as a young stage actress is condemned to die following the murder of a fellow performer. Just like a previous film of his, the silent melodrama 'Easy Virtue (1928),' this film dedicates many of its opening minutes towards a genuinely thrilling courtroom trial. After the damning evidence has been presented to the members of the jury, all but three of the jurors vote to have the young lady, Diana Baring (Norah Baring), hanged for her crime. Hitchcock's apparent disregard for the British legal system is evident for all to see, as the three solitary \"not guilty\" voters are practically bullied into altering their votes. The venerable stage actor Sir John Menier (Herbert Marshall), despite his fervent belief in the girl's innocence, is likewise bullied into changing his decision, pressured by the other jurors' impatient taunts; after mentioning an irrefutable fact of the case, the group would exclaim in unison, \"any answer to that, Sir John?!\" Once the trial has come to an end, Sir John decides to investigate the murder for himself, employing the services of a pair of husband-and-wife actors (Edward Chapman and Phyllis Konstam) to aid him. The novel \"Enter Sir John\" had previously been adapted into a play, and style of the film does exhibit these theatrical roots. Each of the actors (most playing stage performers, no less), do provide performances that are more theatrical than realistic, and Herbert Marshall, in particular, struck me as an actor somewhat akin to our contemporary Kenneth Branagh {who'd be my obvious casting choice for Sir John if a remake were ever conceived}. There is an excellent little spin to the ending, with Hitchcock almost breaking the fourth wall, but not quite. The camera zooms out from the closing shot to reveal that it is taking place on a stage before a large audience, suggesting that the director knew quite well that the style and plot of the film resembled a dramatic performance. Even more interestingly, could Hitchcock be suggesting that we have been watching a play for the past 90 minutes? Rather than watching the events unfold as they happened, could we merely be a member of the audience watching Sir John's theatrical adaptation of the story? This tantalising possibility represents a level of abstract thought that is rather unique among films of its era.",
         "In an early depiction of Hitchcock's fear and mistrust of the police and the legal system, we have a very legal thriller about a murder and it's subsequent trial. We are given the facts of the case, even a sort of a limited view of the murder itself taking place, followed by the prosecution and defense presenting their cases at the trial and a detailed look at the jury's discussion of the case. Sort of Hitchcock's version of 12 Angry Men. There is a curious cast of characters involved in the film, and two of Hitch's biggest interests, the law and the arts, are on center stage. Sir John in the single character who takes the time to really look deeply into what really happened that night, even though someone's life is on the line based on the verdict that they reach, and his personal investigation is probably the best part of the film. One of the things that this movie is famous for is for being the first film where someone's thoughts are shown in a film, in the scene where he is looking at himself in the mirror, shaving. For this scene, a recording of him speaking was played off screen, since vocals could not be added to the film later. There is a scene in the film where Mr. Marlowe goes to visit Sir John at his request, and as he approaches Sir John's desk there is a close up of his feet, which sink deeply into the rug as though it were laid over a soft mattress. This is never explained, although I am willing to accept that this is a spot of symbolism the meaning of which escaped me, since so much of the rest of the film is deeply layered, literally and figuratively, as well. There is an astonishing amount of technique and content to be seen here, impossible to catch all in one viewing, which is one sign of a great film. Some editing and filming techniques I suspect were not as successful as they seemed in the writing stages, but the film is strong nonetheless. Consider, for example, the brave and highly successful technique of lingering on the empty jury room while the verdict is read offstage, and the shockingly effective technique of having the face of the victim hanging in the vision of the murderer. Incredibly, I think this is one of the single most haunting shots I have ever seen in a Hitchcock film. It has its slow moments and may be a bit longer than it's content can support, but this is a brilliant example of Hitch's early work. Also keep your eye out for Hitchcock's cameo, which is a full hour into the film. This was long before he began putting all of his cameos in the beginnings of his films, knowing that the audience would be watching for him and not wanting this to distract from the stories.",
         "Although not as photographically fluid as his later films, Alfred Hitchcock, in his first sound film, managed to overcome the limitations of early recording equipment. With \"Murder,\" he produced an entertaining work that holds up better and does not creak as much as many films of the early sound period. \"Murder\" also provides early clues to themes that continued throughout Hitchcock's movie-making career. The accused perpetrator of a crime, who was caught with circumstantial evidence, has only a single champion that believes in her innocence. The wrongly accused would appear throughout Hitchcock's work from Robert Donat in \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" to Henry Fonda in \"The Wrong Man\" and Cary Grant in \"North by Northwest.\" Sexually ambiguous characters like Handel Fane in \"Murder\" would continue to fascinate Hitchcock over the years as well. Again, from Judith Anderson in \"Rebecca,\" Robert Walker in \"Strangers on a Train,\" Farley Granger and John Dall in \"Rope,\" to even Mrs. Bundy, the ornithologist in \"The Birds,\" Hitchcock displays a fascination with sexual ambivalence. However, the mincing character in \"Murder,\" as played by Esme Percy, is borderline offensive, even in the context of the period. His sexual orientation is more than suggested by the character's predilection to wear women's clothing, revel in applying makeup, and use effeminate gestures. However, despite the film's flaws and limitations, the story of Sir John Menier's efforts to prove a young woman innocent of murder is fairly engrossing. As Sir John, a well-known actor and a member of the jury that convicts the accused woman, Herbert Marshall is stalwart as ever, and he cleverly tracks down clues and devises an intellectual trap for his prey. The rest of the cast has little to do but follow Hitchcock's direction, which is capable but not his finest. For Hitchcock students, \"Murder\" is essential, for other viewers, this early sound effort is generally entertaining, if a bit slowly paced and static visually.",
         "Better than Hitchcock's earlier try at suspense, Blackmail, but still a far cry from his later work. The problem with Murder is that it never seems to find its niche. The movie changes pace so often it's almost hard to keep up with. It opens at a murder scene in which a stage actress, Diana Baring (Norah Baring), seems to have been caught red handed. As the various characters are introduced it looks like we have a classic Hitchcock suspense film building. Before anything really gets going, though, we are taken to Diana's trial, in which we see the entire Jury deliberation in real time. So much time is spent in this setting that you think you're in store for a jury drama in the vein of Twelve Angry Men. The last juror caves, however, and a verdict of guilty is given. Unsatisfied with the outcome, that final juror, Sir John Menier (Herbert Marshall), who is apparently now the leading man, begins his own investigation. Now we've got a detective style mystery. That storyline only goes on for about twenty minutes before the killer is pretty much revealed, and just like that, it's a suspense film again! A short game of wits ensues between Sir John and the killer which ends with the killer offing himself and leaving a confession that sets Diana free. In the last few minutes we are suddenly supposed to care about a love angle between Sir John and Diana. There is some good stuff in the film, but it's all too disjointed for you to be able to enjoy it. Good camera work and art direction.",
         "Enjoyed viewing this great Hitchock Classic which was created in London, England in the early talkie films and the sound and production was very poor but Herbert Marshall, (Sir John Menier) gave an outstanding performance along with Norah Baring, (Diana Baring). Sir John Menier had to serve on a jury and make a very serious decision in a murder case concerning actors and a murder that occurred behind the scenes. Sir John was persuaded by his other jurors to convict Diana Baring of this crime which he did not really feel committed this murder.
