         "Arguably the best novella ever written gets both a reading from Spencer Tracy and a dramatization - neither of which quite mesh with each other. There is a great deal of unnecessary narration, probably owing to the fact that no one thought Hemingway's words could be improved upon. I wish this movie had been made ten years later, when the sparse style of the prose could have been matched by the sparseness of the period. All that aside, it's a beautiful movie and Tracy is excellent. You wouldn't think that an old-hand white guy actor would be able to carry off being a old-hand white guy actor doing an old Cuban man without looking silly. But he does, without trying to do anything besides portraying an aging fisherman. This is the key to his performance - he looks so comfortable in the role that you absolutely believe him as that fisherman. One of his greatest roles.",
         "I read the book again before viewing the movie on video. The book is very short and the movie follows the narration very closely. Some of the narration is dropped, however, in the version I viewed. The fisherman is a lot like many of us as we grow older and it is very heartwarming to see how he faces his tribulations with such a wise philosophy. He does not harbor ill will toward anyone or anything, including the great fish, but accepts life and makes no judgements. Spencer Tracy provides an excellent portrayal, as usual, of the main character. The boy acted very well and I wondered what his future had in store for him. I wondered if He would be effected by the Cuban Revolution a few years later. I told my wife that it would be interesting if he became a revolutionary if the story continued. It was very interesting to find that in real life, according to the Movie data base biography, his father was an economist and a principal participant in the Cuban Revolution a few years later. A book well written and a film adaption that presents the story as I imagined it while reading the book.",
         "Ernest Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\" is a classic literary work but it isn't well suited to screen adaptation. This film has some of the necessary ingredients for success but comes up short in several respects. Spencer Tracy turns in a fine performance as the titular 'old man', one which was rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Felipe Pazos (as the boy), on the other hand, is a dreadful actor and almost drags Tracy's performance down in the scenes that they share. Tracy does double duty as the omniscient narrator as well, though I don't think that it made much sense to delegate that task to the actor playing the main character of the film. John Sturges seems to have had to cobble together footage from various shoots and locations, resulting in a somewhat haphazard look. Budgetary concerns were likely a part of the problem along with limitations in technology. Dimitri Tiomkin's score won an Oscar but I didn't think it was that exceptional. Certainly not nearly as memorable as the scores that Elmer Bernstein provided for Sturges's \"The Magnificent Seven\" and \"The Great Escape\". While some will undoubtedly find the story boring I think that it is easily the best part of this picture. Behind the simple story of a man and his marlin there are layers upon layers of deeper meaning. I could have done without some of the narration, though, particularly when the same thing could have been conveyed with visuals. In the end, I give the content of the film high points though the film's technical aspects are riddled with inadequacies. It's worth watching but you should be prepared for some decidedly rough edges.",
         "One of Spencer Tracy's top performances; it goes down with \"Captain's Courageous.\" Most often a book is better then the movie but in this case the movie brings the book to life. This is due to the somewhat larger then life character of Tracy. The story, although classic and definitely worth while reading, is best summed up by Tracy's acting technique. This was no location film which means the greater portion of realism must come from the actor. A story about a man thinking and talking to himself while he is on a boat for three days would be difficult for any actor. Tracy brings the truest sense of humility and courage to this role. It is enjoyable reading but I encourage anyone to see this movie.",
         "Ernest Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\" is a fine story, but it gives every indication of being quite a challenge to any film-maker hoping to adapt it to the screen. This is a good effort, with a well-conceived approach to getting across the story and the main ideas. Yet it required above all the right leading actor, and Spencer Tracy comes through with a poignant performance that pulls everything else together. Tracy is perfectly cast as the old fisherman. His voice is ideal, not only for the character but also for reading the lengthy voice-over narrations from Hemingway's text. The narration is used to communicate some of the story's key themes, and without just the right reader it probably would not have worked at all. Tracy also seems to identify with the character closely, since his mannerisms and body language almost always seem just right. The action parts of the story rely heavily on stock footage, and sometimes on rather obvious models, but the action is not nearly as important as are the old man's character and his thoughts. Although there are some exciting moments in his battle with nature, it is what these bring out in him, not the events themselves, that are important. What works especially well here are the old man's dreams and thoughts of the past. They are all-important in defining the character, and this adaptation manages them better than you could hope for, with the simplest of means. Once again, Tracy's narration matches the content perfectly. The heart of the story is an honest but compassionate look at a man almost thoroughly ignored by the world, seemingly with little purpose to his life. His importance comes not from any outstanding achievement or valuable talent, but simply because he is a human being, with his own hopes, memories, and worries that are unique to him. This movie version succeeds well in rendering a touching picture of its main character.",
         "I must have seen \"The Old Man and the Sea,\" with Spencer Tracy in the title role (released in 1958), first when I was in High School or College. A very long time ago! My memory, after so many years away from seeing the film, was definitely faulty. For example, I \"remembered\" that there was no dialog, only the music, the sound effects of the watery sea, and, occasionally, the voice of a narrator reading selected passages from Hemmingway's famous novel. That turns out to be wrong, of course. But now, after seeing it again after decades, I wish that it might have been true. I think that scheme might have been better than what is the reality of this old Warner Brothers' movie. I am afraid the film has not aged particularly well. The portions where Tracy is shown super-imposed against an unsaturated rear-projection screen are, unfortunately, all too obvious. And these occur all too often. The music is very \"Hollywoodish\" and out-dated, by turns too saccharin or too \"dramatic\". The footage of some famous sport fisherman's champion marlin catch have color cast and focus all too obviously mismatched with the feature film. And yet, one must graciously allow for the 50-year age of this film, and make allowances. If the viewer can do this, he or she may yet appreciate this classic for its beauty and sincerity. I make the effort to forgive it. And I enjoy it once again.",
         "John Sturges directed this reportedly-troubled production, a handsome adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's story about an old salt who wants one last chance to catch a prized fish before he dies. This scenario puts extraordinary demands on lead actor Spencer Tracy, who is forced to hold the screen nearly alone for ninety minutes. Although he manages to ingratiate himself early on to the viewer, one still doesn't know how to take this character--is he likably stubborn or stubbornly foolish? Either way, Hemingway's tale doesn't quite make its mark as rousing cinematic material, however the finish is very satisfying. It gets a helping hand from Dimitri Tiomkin and his score, which won an Oscar. Remade as a TV-movie in 1990 starring Anthony Quinn. ** from ****",
         "i loved this film and the book from start to finish. i have never studied the book like all you students out there but every time i come across this story i admit that i cry every time. not many films or stories out there do it for me but i suggest that you go to the desert or the ocean for a time on your own and the story will become clear. the emotional impact of the sharks eating the catch at the end creates anger and sadness in my soul and if none of you feel that then you are all dead. altogether a great story and a great film. Spencer Tracy is great. I haven't seen the new version but would be interested in any feedback.",
         "The Old Man And The Sea (1958): Starring Spencer Tracey, Felipe Pazos, Harry Bellaver, Don Diamond, Don Blackman, Joey Ray, Mary Hemingway, Robert Alderette, Mauritz Hugo, Don Alvarado, Richard Alameda....Director John Sturges.. Released in 1958 at a time when audiences were more than familiar with Ernest Hemingway's masterpiece \"The Old Man And The Sea\"- a simple, short story layered with complex symbolism about man vs nature - this film by director John Sturges is a beautiful homage to Hemingway's story. There is much to admire about this film even the fact it drags on and seems rather long and boring, especially because there is much voice-over narration and little dialog. An older Spencer Tracey, in the beginning of the last phase of his long career before his death in 1969, portrays the eponymous Old Man, Santiago while also providing the voice-over narration. Filmed in gorgeous color (in the late 50's mainstream films were in color, independent, art-house or lesser quality films were in black and white) this is a wonderful film and would be terrific for viewing in junior high or high school English classes that read the short novel first and compare it to the film afterward. In truth, the film follows the Hemingway story faithfully, save for a few additional changes in the narration written by Peter Viertel. The decidedly masculine performance by Spencer Tracey is outstanding. He was able to get into character so vividly that even Hemingway would have been satisfied. Everything from his attempt at a Spanish accent to the sheer physicality of the role is right on target. For an older man, Tracey is surprisingly vigorous and fit for the part which calls for physical strength. This way, Tracey magnificently represents the spirit of the Hemingway hero. The narration borders on poetry and it is complimented by the beautiful color cinematography. \"La Mar\" the sea, in its passive and powerful moods, is beautifully depicted in long shots of the ocean. Sunsets, twilight, clouds, birds, flying fish, boats and the Cuban village - everything just like in the novel. The little boy Manolito (Felipe Pazos) is delivering a fine job but its clear this is Spencer Tracey's vehicle, as if to get Oscar attention. The film was not very successful and it seems it was of special interest to fans of Hemingway or of Spencer but this movie is highly underrated and under-appreciated. It's a fine film overall.",
         "Excellent adaptation of Ernest Hemmingway's award winning work makes the following point: That catching the ordinary one is a function of individual luck. Catching the extraordinary one, however, is a delicate balance of an individual's strength, experience, and skill. Storyline: An old, master fisherman, second-guessed by his younger peers for a failure to make a catch in 84 days, nevertheless perseveres day-after-day -- steadfastly driven by a tremendous belief in self, ability, and the anticipation that puts him only one day's luck away from landing the \"big one.\" When the big one is finally hooked, it turns out that hauling it in is more important for reaffirming belief in self and disproving detractors than it is for the prize itself."

         "Now an old man, a lifelong fisherman sets out to sea to ply his trade as he has done all of his life. He's not had much good fortune of late and has gone almost three months without a major catch while others are catching one or even two large marlins every week. Many of the locals make fun of him and some say he's too old now to be fishing but he still loves what he does and is encouraged by a young boy who loves him and has faith in him. On this day he hooks the fish of a lifetime, a marlin that is larger than his skiff. As it slowly pulls him out to sea, the old man reminisces about his past, his successes and the high points of his life. When he does finally manage to land the fish he has to fight off sharks who are feeding on it as he tries to return to his Cuban village.",
