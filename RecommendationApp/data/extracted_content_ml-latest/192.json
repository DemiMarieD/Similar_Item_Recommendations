         "Brian Robbins (Head of the Class) constructed a well made documentary of some of the best MCs during the mid 90's. We get to see some footage of the late, Notorious BIG as well as some live slammin' performances. Though they're cut brief, you can still feel its impact. Wu-Tang, Snoop, Russell Simmons, and RUN DMC are well presented. While \"Rhyme and Reason\", another rap-umentary that came out a year later goes more in depth of hip-hop culture, THE SHOW turns out more entertaining and sourceful. ***",
         "I'm a huge Hip Hop fan, and was very happy to see this documentary was coming out. I felt that finally our culture would be represented to the masses. But after seeing the movie I was disappointed about how shallow the movie was. It might as well have been a documentary on Def Jam and Death Row... with a little bit of Biggie. I advise everyone to put this back on the shelf and go watch Rhyme And Reason. I'll give it a 5 for at least trying to give us what we were all looking for."
