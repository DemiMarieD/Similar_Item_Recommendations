      "synopsis": "Sydney (or simply 'Syd') (Radha Mitchell) is a 24-year-old woman living in New York City who has her whole life mapped out in front of her. Living with longtime boyfriend James (Gabriel Mann), and working her way up at a respected high-art photography magazine called 'Frame', Syd has desires and frustrations that seem typical and manageable. But when a crack in her bathroom ceiling springs a leak and Syd finds herself knocking on the door of her upstairs neighbor to complain about the leak, a chance meeting suddenly takes her on a new path. Opening the door to an uncharted world for Syd is Lucy Berliner (Ally Sheedy), a renowned photographer, enchanting, elusive, and curiously retired. Now age 40, Lucy lives with her once glamorous former model, heroin-addicted German girlfriend Greta (Patricia Clarkson), and plays host to a collection of hard-living party kids. Before Syd's caught her breath, she's caught Lucy's fascination and is drawn into the center of Lucy's strangely alluring life upstairs. Syd mentions Lucy to her bosses (without realizing that she is famous) but they remain uninterested until they realize exactly who Lucy is. Syd then sets up a meeting with Lucy and her employers at a local diner where Lucy frequents. Lucy agrees to work for the magazine as long as Syd is her editor. Soon a working relationship develops between the two and a project is underway which promises a second chance for Lucy's career. But as Syd and Lucy's collaboration draws them closer together, their working relationship turns sexual and the lines between love and professionalism suddenly blur. As Syd slowly discovers the darker truths of Lucy's life on the edge, she is forced to confront her own hunger for recognition and the uncertain rewards of public esteem. In a minor subplot, Lucy makes occasional visits to her estranged Jewish mother Vera (Tammy Grimes), whom is nearly as troubled and self-destructive as her daughter Lucy. Whereas Lucy takes recreational drugs such as cocaine and marijuana, Vera drinks and chain-smokes despite her own failing health. Lucy is open and honest about her sexual orientation to her mother who makes little effort to hide her conempt that her only daughter and child is a lesbian, but seem to half-heartedly accept it anyway. Soon, James becomes more jealous about the amount of time that Syd is spending with Lucy, while Greta also feels the same with Lucy over her meeting with Syd. When Greta passes out and nearly dies from a drug overdose at one of Lucy's parties, she is revived by Syd of all people. Lucy tells Greta to get clean and quit drugs, but Greta refuses unless Lucy ends her business relationship with Syd. Lucy refuses, and Greta moves out to want some space. Lucy then asks Syd to come away with her on a weekend getaway to get inspiration at her parents country house. When James finds out, he makes Syd choose between him or Lucy. He tells Syd that if she goes away from the weekend with Lucy, their romance will be over. Syd goes anyway. During a road trip to the countryside and to the country house, Lucy and Syd talk about their own respective lives. Lucy then begins taking photos of Syd sitting in the car in casual poses. That evening at the country house, Lucy and Syd finally consumate their growing attraction to one another and they both sleep together. In the morning, Lucy takes more photos of a semi-nude Syd in bed and even takes a posted one of herself laying next to Syd in the bed. Upon arriving back in New York the next day, Syd discovers that James has moved out, and Lucy finds likewise with Greta. Afterwords, Lucy gives the photos that she took of the various parties, as well as the photos that she took of Syd and asks to use them for Frame's latest cover. Syd shows the photos to her employers whom are not satisifed with them. Desprate, Syd then shows the photos of her that Lucy took of their weekend together as an alternate to the cover. She is then forced to admit that she and Lucy are now lovers. One evening, Greta returns to Lucy's apartment wanting to get back together with her, but Lucy is hesitent to do so, aware of Greta's contining drug addiction. Greta then convinces Lucy to have one last drug binge together for old times sake. The next morning, as Syd is on her way to work, she finds one of Lucy's friends, Arnie (Bill Sage), sitting in his car outside the apartment building. He tells her that Lucy died apparently from a drug overdose. Syd is filled with conflicting emotions over how to react to it, but Arnie tells Syd that her response no longer matters. In the final scene, Syd arrives at 'Frame' and discovers that they have indeed used Lucy's photos taken of her in their latest magazine piece. As everyone in the office congragulates her for a job well done, the shaken Syd cannot handle this latest turn of events and leaves the office to take the rest of the day off.",

         "HIGH ART is remarkable not only for two of its lead performances, Ally Sheedy and Patricia Clarkson, but for the way it so closely observes its characters' lives. Director Cholodenko has found a way to tell her story that has a strong feel of authenticity. One important component of the film's realism is the set design. These are offices and, particularly, apartments that feel like people actually work or live there. Such authenticity may be nothing new, but the way Cholodenko moves people around in these spaces and they way the actors perform combine to ground in what seems a 'real world'. For those who have known, or been part of, the 'artistic scene' and its reliance on drug use, the numerous sequences set in Lucy's dimly-lit, cluttered living room will ring quite true. Ally Sheedy, attractive, but now slightly hardened in appearance, has gotten deep inside the tormented world of Lucy Berliner. It's a character that will be hard to forget, and the kind of performance that does not seem at all like acting. As Berliner's dissolute former lover, Greta, Patricia Clarkson gives the film its most colorful performance. This does seem like acting, but that is not at all a criticism: Greta is in fact a failed actress and a person whose descent into addiction and self-destruction must be theatrical at any cost. Pretty, round-faced Radha Mitchell is not at the level of these two powerhouses, but her Syd is nicely understated and appropriately wistful. Also very fine in the cast are impossibly handsome Bill Sage as a hanger-on and Tammy Grimes as Lucy's stern, distant mother. HIGH ART depicts a world where some discuss the minute details of a photograph in the most abstruse terms of deconstruction or ambiguous 'art babble', while others grapple with the basic questions that haunt us all. It's an extreme close-up on the human condition.",
         "Syd, the female Assistant Editor of an Art Photography magazine called \"Frame\", meets Lucy Berliner, a great photographer who dropped out of the public eye ten years ago, and is now living in a drug-addicted world of low-life \"friends\" who walk around half-conscious in a zombie-like drug-induced stupor, and occasionally stop breathing altogether. The atmosphere of this depressive world is conveyed so perfectly it's almost palpable. The acting and directing are perfection. Syd begins to lead Lucy into a world of drug-free sobriety, and Lucy leads Syd into her world of beautiful, tender lesbian love, a world of mutual respect and sensitivity, and again, this world is so perfectly conveyed you can feel it surrounding you as you are drawn into this hauntingly realistic film. You can tell they're just right for each other. They both outgrow their previous rather dysfunctional relationships and find themselves falling in love. But will Lucy slide back into her no-hope world of wheedling, pathetic friends? Or will she overcome the pull of their need for her, and find the courage and strength to walk away? Either way, you're going to want to buy a copy of this video, and treasure it among your collection of great works of art. I can't think of a single reason why this film should be given less than ten out of ten. By anybody.",
         "I've been reading a lot of the comments about this movie, and i've seen it probably 3 or more times. Yet most of the comments seem to establish it as just a lesbian movie. I don't believe that. I am a lesbian yet that has nothing to do with what i think about the movie, and the same goes for the characters. Syd falls in love with Lucy but i don't see is as her \"coming out as a lesbian\". She's opening up to new feelings, and it just happens to be with a woman who is in a disastrous relationship already. Yet the movie itself grasps the inner depths of the characters. All the scenes seem to fold perfectly amongst each other, the subject of photography probably had something to do with it giving it a more symbiotic meaning to the story. This movie was great and every time i watch it i am left with a serene complacent feeling, even though the ending wasn't as expected.",
         "In 'the age of indies', where we currently find ourselves, a common technique is to heavy hand the viewer, scaring him with the harsh realities of some off-beat lifestyle. And all those possibilities exist in High Art, where the real grunge of lower Manhattan is briefly exposed, yet here, the filmmaker chooses to seduce us with it, rather than hit us over the head. Ally Sheedy does a good job as druggie social misfit, Lucy Berliner. Lucy's been able to lead a life devoid of any traditional responsibility, choosing instead to hang out with a sub-culture of drug motivated homosexual and asexual miscreants, where days and years pass by faster than a paper calendar unfurling in a Frank Capra movie. That she might jump start a promising career as a photographer under the bright-eyed prodding of young Syd (Radha Mitchell) is not surprising, it's a familiar refrain. And that Lucy seduces Syd is also predictable. Where the movie does surprise is the relaxed way in which it delivers it's message, and, although Sheedy and Mitchell are both very good, for my money the movie is damn near stolen by Patricia Clarkson, who is brilliant in every scene she plays. If you remember her as Ted Hoffman's caring, intelligent wife in year one of 'Murder One' you'll really appreciate what a marvelous actress she is. I came in expecting to dislike the movie, and left quite pleased. I definitely recommend.",
         "Hard, tough, occasionally dream-like drama involving a drug-abusing lesbian photographer who's currently on \"hiatus\"; lured back into the professional world by a pretty art-magazine gopher, she finds herself in the middle of an affair. Emotionally intense movie is sharp and focused, though hurt by a puzzling finish. Ally Sheedy's award-winning performance as the shutterbug is one of her finest. It took a long time for Sheedy to reach the point where she could appear in a film like this and not seem out of place; her acting is getting more refined with age, and her brave turn here appears to put her juvenile romps (like, say, \"Short Circuit\") to bed. Radha Mitchell is also very good as the post-teen who falls for her. Gripping, moving film. *** from ****",
         "After the trash of the past twenty or so years -- titles withheld to protect the incompetent -- someone finally makes a movie with a lesbian love angle that not only works, but shines. An exquisite performance by Ally Sheedy highlights this haunting study of a woman and the culture which ensnares her. A solid plot, likable -- if not perfect -- characters give flesh and blood to this dark character study. Added kudos to Patricia Clarkson; she took a character who tread the fine line between sympathetic and just plain pathetic and made Greta a complex, but not confusing nor inconsistent, woman. Well done, all around!",
         "I thought this movie was absolutely beautiful. To begin with, the cinematography was a wonderful experiment. A variety of contemporary photographers were hired to shoot individual scenes or stills used in the movie. While this device could have left us with a fragmented feeling, it worked quite well to put us in the mind of characters who work in \"art\" photography. The plot was poignant and difficult. While it could have left me unsatisfied with a Hollywood ending, it took a bolder route, which in the end was much more satisfying. I felt that the acting was quite well done. This script could have led to a lot of really dreadful mugging for the camera, but the director got very specific performances from a talented cast. Though not as widely acclaimed as \"Laurel Canyon\" I thought this movie was more satisfying. If you liked Canyon, this one definitely deserves to be seen.",
         "I skipped this in the theatres and shouldn't have. I am completely haunted by Ally Sheedy's performance since seeing this fine film on video. Riveting.",
         "I am always on the lookout for good lesbian movies with good acting and they are very hard to find. High Art fills both criteria, but every time I watch this movie I feel depressed. I don't know why, especially since I don't mind \"dark\" movies in the least. The relationships between the characters just feel empty to me. And, I never quite know what to make of the heretofore straight girl who falls for the gay girl. It must be said that the acting is quite good, especially Patricia Clarkson as the drugged out girlfriend of Ally Sheedy. Sheedy is also fantastic as the burned out photographer Lucy Berliner. I just didn't relate to any of these characters or to their relationships with each other, and in the end did not really care who lived or died.",
         "Just my opinion: Most of the Actors in High Art have narrow ranges, but that doesn't make them \"bad\" actors, just limited to a range of motion (like a great distance runner who is a lousy sprinter). It takes a patient and focused Director to recognize what that kind of actor can do in the right setting. Most Directors seem to steam roller through their vision of the script and force actors to conform to an abstract idea (they make the poor sprinter sprint anyway instead of giving them a long quiet run to excel at). High Art isn't about Ally Sheedy showing she's an unappreciated powerhouse, it's about Director Lisa Cholodenko giving Ally the room and role to do the kind of acting she's never been allowed to do. Fellow \"distance runner/lousy sprinter\" Radha Mitchell is also perfectly placed in every scene. These two are the narrower players, they're like bold colors you can't use to excess and can't water down without ruining the whole painting. Then like a good painter Cholodenko does bring in a powerhouse in someone like Patricia Clarkson. Unlike Sheedy and Mitchell, Clarkson is spread thin and applied liberally. And I don't mean screen time. Clarkson's pull on the plot between Sheedy and Mitchell makes their specialized boldness stand out. It gives them weight and dissolves into itself. The painting analogies are cheesy, but that's what the grace of this film is to me. Clarkson is definitely a deeper actor than Sheedy or Mitchell, but instead of upstaging them her role in this film elevates them. If you were to paint two small but boldly colored flowers on a canvas you would need a more universal, softer backdrop to make the two flowers take form (in a realistic painting at least). This movie is not about a plotline, not really. Like a painting it suggests something with a seemingly straight ahead depiction of, well: drugs and sexual awakenings, career ambition, disillusionment that follows great success. It's flawless to me because it only suggests these things and does not offer any conclusions. It just is. High Art."
