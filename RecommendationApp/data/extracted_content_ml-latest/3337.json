         "I first saw this movie on Canadian TV on the midnight movie on CJOH and it has stuck in my head ever since. Back then, I enjoyed it for the psychedelic dream sequences, the dolly birds, and the good ol' \"frank sexuality.\" Watching it again on DVD thirty years later, I find it still resonates, but for different reasons. Now, I relate more to Quint's rejection of his entire way of life and the way he wants to be free of it, but ultimately can't escape it. The Super-8 commercial he makes at the end of the film is still dazzling -- one would think that Michael Winner would have gone on to greater things, but this film is the best thing he ever did. Same goes for Oliver Reed, although he made some good ones in the late '60s and early '70s. Several other Reed-Winner collaborations, THE SYSTEM (a/k/a THE GIRL GETTERS), THE JOKERS, and HANNIBAL BROOKS, are also worth checking out. Excellent performances by Reed, Orson Welles, Carol White, and Harry Andrews, and a top script by Peter Draper (who also wrote THE SYSTEM). Favorite bit of dialogue: QUINT: I'm going to find an honest job. LUTE: Silly boy. There aren't any.",
         "There were so many good British films made in the 60s ,that you rarely hear this one mentioned .Thou,it is a worthy film and is comparable to 'Performance' and 'Women in Love' as one of the best films of the era.It's about a Business executive who has to re-think his life and relationships for what they are worth. Orson Welles is great as his creepy Boss and all of the female actors who play his many girlfriends did a very convincing job. The Dream sequences are very LSD inspired. If you like it also See 'The System' by the the same filmmaker.",
         "(POSSIBLE SPOILER IN THIS COMMENT) Many aspects of sixties 'Swinging London' are portrayed in this film. Sixties motifs are shown with accuracy: colourful clothes, 'swinging' parties, a desire to be 'with it' and live in the now. However, grimmer aspects are also shown: public school bullying, the nastier side of the British Class system, and the ruthless world of advertising. An appalling accident in mid-plot totally defamiliarised me and left me in a state of shock for the rest of the film. I identified with Quint's loss completely. His violent rebellion against the 'system' at the beginning is followed through to an affective browbeating of the same system by its own methods. A well made-film I always like to see again.",
         "In its original form,\"I'll never forget whats'isname\"was briefly notorious for being the first mainstream film to use the \"F\" word.Mis C.White was the lady responsible - a giant leap for womankind indeed. Now its efficacy is blunted by constant use.Perhaps some clever person will one day invent another word one tenth as satisfying as F- dash used to be until the \"Lady Chatterley\" trial made in permissible in society,polite or otherwise.F - dash is what I say. The much - vilified Mr M.Winner pulled one out of the hat here. His theme of humanity being unable to cope with the strains of modern city life is repeated here(I suspect he would have loved to have made \"Lost in Translation\"). Although the Orson Welles character was alleged by the writer to have been based on Mr Winner,it is Oliver Reed as a disenchanted Cambridge man whose character is more like the director's. This is a very disturbing study of alienation.Mr Reed,whose subsequent career as a TV chat show drunk should not be allowed to overshadow his talent for playing menacing upper middle class charmers with secrets,is superb as the Public School ad man in crisis.His life implodes spectacularly and he uses the experience to make a commercial for Lute (Mr O.Welles,relatively restrained)that is deliberately horrific.It wins the award Lute longs for and Reed gradually recovering from his experiences decides to set up his own company in opposition. Don't be put off either by Mr Winner's subsequent career as a boorish food critic and appalling actor in TV ads,because,as a director,he was capable of making brilliant movies when the mood took him. Believe me \"I'll never forget whatsisname\" is one of them.",
         "Although constructed around \"swinging \" London this tale of futility in the pursuit of happiness endures. Oliver Reed will come as a surprise to most people who would not have thought the latter day hell raiser could deliver such a sensitive performance as the central character Andrew Quint. A successful advertising exec Quint belabours the notion of a simple life and eschews the trappings of his current situation ( both professional and domestic ) to work at a small literary magazine with a friend from his days at Oxford. These trappings include two mistresses and an ex wife. The scenes with the mistresses are perhaps the least pleasing of the whole film. \"I never really saw the money anyway, it came in and went out ; if I felt like being successful I'd go and buy a new shirt\" A series of symbolic events unfold ( most notably a public school reunion and the pointless death of his new girlfriend )which only serve in Quint considering joining an equally exploitative competitor to the ad agency he quit at the outset.",
         "Pretty poor film in terms of plot and structure but interesting as a glimpse of a long gone London and for some lovely footage of Cambridge. Also worth casting your eye over the cast, Welles looking bloated and unwell, Reed's striking looks somewhat dented by the facial scarring as a result of a 1963 bar fight and Carol White youthful and beautiful before her succumbing in following years to substance addiction. Michael Winner makes one his final Brit films before moving to Hollywood and it's certainly no classic, kind of a 'Garden State' of its day - episodic but contrived and laboured. However, England looks good and the 60s do look pretty swinging."
