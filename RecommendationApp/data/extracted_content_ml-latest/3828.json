         "Without question the worst movie I have ever seen. Films such as \"Plan 9 from outer space\" are bad, but are entertaining for it - this film fails to engage the viewer on any level, even those who are fans of the \"Dysfunctional family\" genre of movie. Most movies have at least one positive attribute - this one, sadly, is an exception. The characters seem to be doing things without motivation or reason - it isn't clear why the father returned, and even less clear why everyone just accepted his direction without question. The term \"spoiler\" does not apply to this movie - it is more a \"Coup de grace.\" I'd tell you how the film ended but my brain started to dribble out of my ears half way through. I suppose the bottom line is this - \"Better Living\" wasn't nominated for any awards, has received far more bad reviews than good (if any!) and was gracing the shelves of our local \"Poundland\" shop. The film is so bad that the actual disk is devoid of any credits, merely having the film title printed on it - no one wanted to own up to having anything to do with this disaster of a movie. About the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that I sold it at a car boot sale for slightly more than I paid for it...",
         "LOVED IT! GREAT COMEDY! I don't know what movie this guy was watching , I thought it was funny and dark and the performances were great. I'm not the only one who thought it was well written. I looked up the Variey review which said \"Vibrant, snappy and surprisingly fresh, \"Better Living\" breathes a little life into the increasingly by-the-numbers genre of the dysfunctional-family comedy.\" Go check out the Variety's review if you want it a great opinion from a credible source in the industry. P.S. You have to go through the archives to retrieve the review.",
         "I bought this film because Olympia Dukakis was in it. I thoroughly enjoyed her role as Mrs Madrigal in Tales of the City and so have looked out for her in other films since and most have been well worth the while but this dreadful film isn't one of them. It's not often you reach the end of a film and don't have a clue as to what it was all about but this is one of them. It has no storyline, no plot, terrible dialogue and is a complete waste of talented actors. The acting is good but you can't believe in any of the characterisations because you cannot recognise people like this in real-life! They seem to all be from a different planet somewhere. Please everyone, do yourselves a favour and avoid this horror of a movie. It has NOTHING good going for it at all and one can only assume, it was a stopgap part for all the actors involved. The one decent thing is the music, which is quite good. Don't waste any time watching this. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"

Their father, an ex-cop, disappeared 15 years earlier and then re-appeared with no explanation and commandeers his wife's project by placing the whole family in a survivalist situation. Jack is the priest-brother to the mother, who is forced to counsel the family despite his own problems with his faith."],
