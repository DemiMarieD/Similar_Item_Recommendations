      "reviews": ["This is a short from the Hubley Studio. There will be mild spoilers ahead: This is a trio of Australian aboriginal tales/myths. Apart from having the titles of the segments read aloud, there's no narration. The tales are told visually. With two of them, this works reasonably well, though the last one suffers a bit without a bit more explanation. The animation is in the style Faith Hubley used for decades, with an emphasis on animals and some human figures. It's quite stylized and very nice to look at for the most part. If you're unfamiliar with the subject matter, the stories can be hard to follow. This short is available on The Hubley Collection: Volume 1 and is well worth tracking down. This short is enjoyable, if a bit flawed. Recommended"],
