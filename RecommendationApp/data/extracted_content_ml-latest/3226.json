There have been so many rumors about RJ and this put some of the myth to rest by separating fact and fiction. I knew there was a Robert Johnson, Jr. who got a settlement from the estate of RJ. There was also a stepson, who gave some great input into his life. The Blues researchers and musicians who focused on his music were great to listen to also. I sincerely recommend it for any Blues enthusiast."],
