         "Don't waste your time on this poorly-made movie. The story is insultingly contrived and the acting is robotic. The director, obviously amateur, has no idea what she is doing with the camera, the actors, or the film. The editing is particularly clumsy. Many scenes drag on forever like a student movie where every frame is too good to lose. One earnest love scene is jarringly interrupted by random cutaways. Flashes of unmotivated nudity are unflattering and obviously there to help sell the film. It's one of those movies which makes you wonder why anyone bothered, or why no one stood up and honestly told the filmmakers what they were about to do is in very, very poor taste. Well, the title should give most people a good idea where this movie belongs.",
         "This movie proves that any film can get distribution. The movie had nothing to do with the title. 1st graders can give better acting performances. The story was trying to be some kind of mystery. It played off more as a B movie.",
         "This is a really terrific film. It's very unique...I saw it at a special screening --the director/writer has a great sense of humor -- it's very funny - but poignant at the same time..it is very different, genre bending, and worth the cost of a movie ticket...it's a roller coaster ride...definitely two thumbs up - go see it if it's playing at a theater near you..."
