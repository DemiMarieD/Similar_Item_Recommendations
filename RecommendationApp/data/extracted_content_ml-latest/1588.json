         "Thumbs up to the director and the stars of George of the Jungle. They have made one of the funniest children's films that you will ever see. You know that they had a great time making it because it's clearly evident on the screen. George of the Jungle is simply just a Tarzan parody. (Ape-man meets girl, falls for girl, leaves for city, returns to jungle). But the predictable plot doesn't destroy the performances and the movie is peppered with some laugh out loud jokes. Of course the special effects are impressive - a talking ape, an elephant that thinks he's a dog - but it's the humans that steal the show. Fraser is fantastic as George - he is one of the most talented actors out there at the moment - though this film doesn't test his range much, he shows a nice comic flair. Mann is a lovable foil for our hero, though her squeaky voice is at times too cute. None of the other characters disappoint. Both Mann's parents are great in supporting roles and Lyle as Mann's nasty fiance is sensational. Kids will love this. Adults, I think will find a lot to enjoy in it also, but don't bring along any cynics. They'll miss out on all the fun!!",
         "Brilliant smashing comedy movie! The characters are original and fun. As if you're seeing a big family in a movie, everyone's interacting perfectly. The animals are definitely the best. The ape, especially the elephant. Very funny and spectacular! Just watch it with the whole family. It's really fun. I promise.",
         "A lot of movies have been fashioned after cartoons, but not all of them are successful. \"George of the Jungle\" is one of the few that score a hit in that department. The movie captures the slapstick feel of the original cartoon. Brendan Fraser plays his part well, as the dimwitted but lucky George. And I can't really imagine a different voice for the ape named Ape than that of John Cleese!",
         "This was a pretty entertaining comedy with a few twists added, such as a talking gorilla, which made it fun to watch. We also see an elephant act like a dog and along the way our hero (Brendan Fraser) is a likable boob. Sometimes it's just plain stupid but that's what you get with any comedy. Disney has this in the \"PG\" mode so we get some of the standard peeing, farting, sex jokes and innuendos, kicking people in the groin....you know, all those supposedly-hilarious gags that have become so commonplace in modern family comedies. There is enough original material in here, though, to enjoy this a couple of times.",
         "Actually, a lot of fun. Sure, it's lame. It's SUPPOSED to be lame. It pokes fun at itself for being lame. (\"George can't die -- he's the hero.\") Don't expect great special effects, real Nature, a solid plot, or Oscar-caliber acting. This is mind candy. In a lot of ways, the plot is like Titanic -- nice new boy steals girl away from sleezebag fiancee she's just marrying to please her mother. But since Ursula ditches Lyle before taking up with George, there's none of the moral bankruptcy that made Titanic such a stinker. And, of course, nobody is supposed to take George of the Jungle seriously anyway.",
         "Brendan Fraser is nothing short of perfect as the klutzy king of the jungle who does all he can to win the girl of his dreams. Packed with plenty of tree banging gags, hilarious wisecracks(note the narrator) and cartoonish comedy. Harmless fun for all ages. 3/4",
         "Even though it's a Disney movie and can be viewed by the whole family, the movie was quite funny. Not Naked Gun funny, but still funny nonetheless. It is definitely worth the price of rental or purchase, so long as you like silly/unrealistic circumstances, talking animals, etc. For those of you keeping score, this movie was much funnier than Dudley Do-Right, which had some similarities.",
         "Big screen adaptation of the much beloved cartoon character recounts how George (admirably played with affable density by Brendan Fraser) met his wife Ursula (played by the adorable Leslie Mann). The only thing standing between them being Ursula's mom (played by Holland Taylor), Ursula's obnoxious fiance Lyle (Thomas Haden Church) and poacher duo. Helping George is his loyal elephant/dog Shep, the toucan, and the Ape Named Ape (voiced with biting cynicism by John Cleese). Yeah it's not great cinema but hey, it's not a misfire either. It's funny most of the time and it shows that Fraser has cornered the affable stranger in a strange land market. Very few actors can play characters who are essentially idiots without losing audience sympathy or credibility, but somehow Fraser manages to do it. Best gags include include the smart ass narrator, George getting hyped up on coffee, the women at Ursula's party fawning over George's deep spiritual connection with animals, George swinging into various objects (most notably the San Francisco bridge sequence) and George's climatic battle with the poachers. \"My noble kinsmen, thou has served me well. Now stand aside while Shep doth dispatch these villains.\" - George speaking ape",
         "'George of the jungle'is a silly movie,but we can have some laughs. One of the reasons why the movie is worthwhile is Brendan Fraser's hot body,because in all his career I personally think this is the movie that he is in his best, physically speaking. This movie is a Tarzan's parody, where the baby George,after an airplane accident, gets lost in the Africa (specifically in the jungle) and is raised by apes. 25 years later, he is a beautiful and strong man, and he turned to be the king of the jungle, even being a little clumsy and naive in many times. Ursula and Lyle are the rich couple who are walking in the Africa's jungle where Tarzan lives. They are engaged, but Ursula is not very happy with that decision. (What I personally think is very acceptable, once Lyle is a stupid materialist coward) But when Tarzan saves Ursula and they start to get close,many things are about to change, and Ursula's marriage with Lyle is one of them. Ps: funny facts: 1-The talking monkey, who is an intellectual with British accent 2- Shep, George's ''dog'',who actually is an elephant.",
         "Really, i don't understand because the rating of this movie is low. In my country, this movie bring on the theatre thousands. I give to this movie rating 8. \"George of the Jungle\" is a adaptation of the cartoon that has the same name. Really, i prefer a thousand times the movie than the cartoon. This movie it's very funny, Brendan Frasier is hilarious played George also his co-star Leslie is lovely. Also, we don't forget the George's friends, Ape and Elephant that are responsible for very good moments in this movie. There are few movies that i laugh so many times as \"George of the Jungle\". \"George of the Jungle\" is a very funny movie."
