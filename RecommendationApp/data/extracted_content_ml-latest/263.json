         "content": "Maggie meets George at a bar. He has fallen for her while she was singing, and wants to know everything about her life. He finally gets her sad story, how the authorities took her four children (after one of them was  burned badly when she was out working), how the man she was with continously beat her. Her life was a tragic one, and of course she doesn't trust anyone.\r\n\r\nGeorge, by the way, is from Paraguay and has a tragic story of his own. He is a man with a strong will, and believes that he can change Maggie and give her the life that she deserves. Two times, Maggie and George makes a baby, and both times the authorities comes to take them away. Imagine how you would react to having 6 children removed from you, now imagine how Maggie and George reacts. It is a heartbreaking story, and sadly, a true one.\r\n\r\nKen Loach is a master of showing us how life really is. He doesn't want to sugarcoat anything, he just wants us to realize that these people are real, that they are our neighbours and friends, the people we pass on the street, see in the supermarket. He also wants to show us how wrong the system is (I think), and how little they care for the parents and, ultimately, the children. I mean, sure, if the kids were actually beaten or abused, they would need to be removed right away, but in this movie, there is no evidence to suggest that. So aren't the kids better off with their real parents? Throughout the movie, Maggie gets worse (only barely hanging on to her sanity), as the system strip her of all dignity, we even learn that she was abused as a kid, and placed at an institution.\r\n\r\nYou have to love a real life drama, to love this movie. There is no wonderland here to hide in, and even though the end suggests that Maggie and George finally got to keep three children (and become a family), there is no happy ending here. It is unbearable to watch at times, but only because the actors does a great job at making this seem real. Life can be unbearable.\r\n\r\n_Last words... don't be intimidated by the story. This is no action movie, but you'll definitely be the better person for watching it._",

         "Ken Loache's \"Ladybird, Ladybird\" is a superb film, and even manages to improve on the director's two earlier efforts from this decade; \"Riff Raff,\" (1991) and the remarkable \"Raining Stones\" (1993). However, whereas the afore-mentioned films combined social, working-class issues with a fair quantity of fun and humour, \"Ladyird, Ladybird\" is Loache's most serious and powerful study of Northern, working-class life in the nineteen nineties, with only a dash of humour. The story centres around a middle-aged Liverpudlian woman called Maggie, who now lives in Manchester. After a chance metting in a pub one evening with a kind and articulate South American called Jorge, Maggie recalls her traumatic life to her new friend, from her own violent upbringing, right the way up to just very recently, where social services took away her children, following domestic abuse from Maggie's ex boyfriend and a tragic accident in which her eldest son was very seriously scarred. As the relationship between Maggie and Jorge becomes all the more intimate over the eventual weeks, Maggie finds herself in another battle with social services as she becomes pregnant with his child. Perhaps the most obvious thing to mention about \"Ladybird, Ladybird\" first of all, is the quality of the performances. Crissy Rock, a real-life stand up comedian, is quite extraordinary in her debut acting role - This really is an Oscar deserved performance which needs to be seen to be believed. Meanwhile, Ray Winstone is well on form in a small but important cameo, whilst under Loache's direction, the remainder of the cast all turn out well above par performances. The script is superb, and is never afraid to confront the issues that dog modern life in Britain for so many today. Whilst the film is a study of many themes, it's clear to see exactly what Loach is trying to get his audience to understand about our protangist by the end. Everybody knows a character like Maggie; a hard woman, but a good woman. There is no doubt in our mind that she loves her children and will do anything for them. During the opening sequence, she lovingly shows photos of each child to Jorge, describing each one's personalities one by one. However, the big question \"Ladybird, Ladybird\" is asking, is Is love enough? Should someone like Maggie be allowed to continue looking after her children? Do social services really have the right to take anyones children away? Does anyone? Whilst \"Ladybird, Ladybird\" provides little answers to these questions, it does, at least represent that at least Britain has a filmmaker out there who really does know what's going on in modern day England. Perhaps the only grittier and more realistic British film I've ever seen is Gary Oldman's \"Nil by Mouth,\" which, in some areas, confronts similar issues as this movie. \"Ladybird, Ladybird\" isn't a film for everyone. Some won't like its grittiness and some may not find its themes and characters particularly appealing. However, this is a great movie from a great director, and, similarly to \"Nil by Mouth,\" made just three years later, although both movies were made on a fraction of the budget of most American films, \"Ladybird, Ladybird\" proves to be a thousand times more thoughtful, intelligent and downright brilliant than the majority of commerical, stereotype-dominated fluff like \"Titanic.\"",
         "My jaw was on the floor throughout this film. I was amazed at the intensity of Crissy Rock's performance and I was aghast at all of the horrible things that she had to endure. Vladimir Vega's subtle work as Jorge should be given an equal amount of credit. The emotional honesty in this movie is amazing and I had to pause the VCR a couple of times because I was so shaken up. Definitely worth your time, and an excellent introduction to the work of a worthy director.",
         "Kenneth Loach ,among all the great directors in the world,has always been one of the very few who depicts the \"riff raff\" ,to quote one of his works.In his universe, you will not find the young lawyer ,the yalie,the dynamic executive,the journalist with good prospects or the handsome detective with his gorgeous assistant.All his characters are individuals struggling against the authorities and who cannot win:the little boy from \"kes\",the young girl from 'family life\",the two buddies on the dole from \"looks and smiles\",and the unfortunate mother from \"ladybird ladybird\". \"Ladybird,ladybird\" is a harsh movie,sometimes unbearable,definitely not for all tastes.Crissy Rock is absolutely astounding,she does not play the part,she really lives it,leaving us on the edge of our seat.Her screams,her tears,her anger are so real that,had Loach not said it was a true story,we would believe in it anyway.Loach's treatment is stripped of any embellishment.No need for strings when fate strikes once more the heroine.Her partner,an immigrant,is a good man who loves her sincerely ;he suffers because he feels helpless,and when she beats him,he does not complain:his despair is so deep he contemplates suicide.We are far from the immigrant macho cliché. The heroine must come from a poor social background,so she was never taught the rules of the game,so she is bound to fail.But Loach avoids to show us the people from the social services as \"baddies\":it's for her own good,they say.They reason by the establishment's rules,but they never try to communicate with the mother,deemed irresponsible,unable to get a place in the community.The end of the movie preserves the viewer from despair though.Every dog has his day,they say.May it be true for this poor couple!",
         "I challenge any parent who has been questioned over the care of the children or any person who has been unjustly accused of neglect as I have have once been, to sit and watch this disturbing powerhouse of a film. I paused it twice during my original sitting and had to take a moment to deal with what I was being confronted with once again. Rarely . . . yes VERY RARELY does a film or a movie engage me to this point. I have seen several Ken Loach films and I live in admiration of this artist/man, but yet I wasn't prepared for what I sat and watched. I give this 10 out of 10 and am shocked that it hasn't been recognised further by any awards society such as \"The Bafta\" and \"Academy Awards\". Chrissy Rock, I take my hat off to you to have the guts to give all that you gave for your performance, the the actor that played \"Jorge\" . . you have delivered a standout performance. Ken Loach, you are my hero. Indeed I stand by my title, possibly the most powerful and disturbing film every made. Magnificent. Ambitious. It delivers.",
         "Chrissy Rock gave an unforgettable performance in this little seen film. i highly recommend anyone to go out and rent it. another great but \"little seen\" film is \"Once Were Warriors\". my advice is if you go to the video store to rent a couple movies, and are interested in how movies should be made,search for these 2 titles,and you'll see your trip to the video store was well worth it!",
         "This film defies description and cannot be put into a category. It's one-of-a-kind in every positive sense ot the label. Performances are all sensational, with a breakout debut by the female lead. When I learned this was based on a true story, I was even more astounded by this remarkable gem of a film. SEE IT! You won't forget it; you definitely won't regret it. I guarantee!",
         "Ladybird, Ladybird is one of Ken Loach's most dramatic working class drama's. The use of melodrama to put across political points about the oppression of middle-class systems on the working-classes is subtly brilliant. After watching the film I was very depressed for quite a while. Although I was obviously traumatised by social services taking not just one but two of Maggie and Jorge's children shortly and immediately after birth, I couldn't decide if it was somehow her own fault. If you leave your four children alone in a hostel and one of them nearly dies in a fire can you really expect to be deemed capable of providing a 'safe' environment for children? Her rage about this judgement of self it seems is immense. She cannot as Jorge suggests 'talk nicely' to anyone. The frustration of her being trapped by her circumstance of class is evident. That said, I think it was very harsh of social services to condemn the women to be without children for the rest of her life, people can change and with Jorge it seems that she does find a more stable centre but the pain of the loss will never fade. I hope that the real Maggie and Jorge find peace and are one day reunited with their 'lost' children. The fact that this film has been based on real life makes it even more heartbreaking. Not the cheeriest of films but one that you should watch at some point in your lifetime and form your own views. It's very thought provoking which is what Loach intends his films to be.",
         "This is a story about a British woman who struggles to keep her children. Ken Loach's movies are always good and they always deal with sad and gritty subjects. The thing that struck me most about this movie was that although I initially felt sympathy for the main character, Maggie, I quickly lost it. She's so upset she is completely uncooperative with the social services people, who are often judgmental and unlikeable, but who are only trying to do their jobs. When Maggie finds a lover who does not abuse her as her earlier partners did, she refuses to appreciate his steadfastness, his decency and his loyalty to her, and she tries to drive him away. I was surprised to find myself so unsympathetic to Maggie. My frustration with her grew, and I found myself saying, aloud, \"God, she's impossible!\" Even though I didn't like the character, the movie is so good, I could not tear my eyes away from it. Ken Loach is a genius. I think the hardest works are those with unsympathetic main characters. If you still find yourself fascinated, even though you find yourself detesting the protagonist in a movie, it makes the viewing even more memorable. I sometimes feel sad that I have no children; yet, when I see this story, I feel better about it. I also wonder why I cannot muster much sympathy for Maggie, even though I have things in common with the character. Society is especially unforgiving when dealing with parents. In its well-meaning interest in the welfare of the children, it often fails to reach out to the parents who are sometimes quite good people, but who are struggling to cope. Almost everyone could benefit from seeing this movie. It's highly instructive. It makes you think about the roles we, as adults, play in society, and what our responsibilities are. None of the questions and issues raised by this movie are easy to deal with. There are no easy answers. I think both great objectivity and subjectivity are necessary toward finding solutions, and both are seldom possible at the same time; hence, mistakes are made, all around. The character of the good man she finally finds is beautifully played by an unknown actor. I wondered how he could continue to be so good, and yet I felt myself completely frustrated with him and annoyed with him when he tried to explain his reasons for being a political exile from his country of origin in a court hearing. He was so upset that for once, he couldn't think clearly and couldn't express himself adequately. This showed me that despite his \"good\" qualities, under extreme pressure, he could be as hard to understand and to help as Maggie is. This movie is based on a true story, which is, sadly, not hard to believe. This same type of situation is played out again and again. What to do? Leave children in questionable households, or take them away? Try to see this movie and to share it with someone who is troubled, who has been abused, and who has had problems dealing with administrations of almost any kind. It's very instructive, even though, as I've said, no answers are given.",
         "Before watching this movie I already knew that Ken Loach is famous for his socially inspired movies, which sometimes look more like a documentary than like pure cinema. That already prepared me for what I was about to see, as I knew that it wouldn't be a 'life is oh so beautiful and lovely' movie. But that it would be such a moving and touching film, I really didn't know. \"Ladybird Ladybird\" tells the story of Maggie Conlan, an unmarried mother of four children from four different men, who she has all left. In a karaoke bar she meets Jorge, a Paraguayan immigrant who is different from all the men she has had in her life so far. He takes his time to listen to her story and that's how we too get to know all that has happened to her. She has had an unhappy childhood, has been beaten and kicked by all the men in her life and social services have taken away her children from her, because they were convinced that she wasn't able to take care of them when one of them almost died in a tragic accident. Together with Jorge, she keeps fighting desperately for the custody over her children, so they can make their family whole again. But these bureaucrats are convinced that Jorge doesn't just love her for no reason. They believe he only uses her to stay in the country and when they get children of their own, they are confiscated as well... When it comes to the acting I can be quite brief. It's just excellent. This was Crissy Rock's very first role, but she acts like she hasn't done anything else in her entire life. The same for Vladimir Vega. Together they make you forget that you are watching a movie with actors in it. This feels more like a documentary, filmed by a camera crew that just happened to be in the right place at the right time to film one of the most touching and realistic docu-drama's ever. I don't really think there is a perfect way to describe what this excellent movie does to you. Saying that it shows the darkest side of human kind is perhaps not even strong enough, because it is also a very sober, but incredibly touching movie. And even though some people say that it's sometimes difficult to sympathize with Maggie Conlan, I don't follow them in their opinion. Of course you could say that it's her own fault that she has lost her children, but when you see how she has been treated from her childhood on until adulthood, you can understand why she acts and reacts the way she does. All she has ever known was violence and shouting, so it's no wonder that she does exactly that when feeling threatened. As a conclusion I would like to add that I'm not easily moved by a movie anymore, but this one certainly did something to me. It's hard to explain why this is so powerful as I believe that the feeling of realism can't be the only reason. I guess you just have to see it for yourself. All I can say is that I liked it a lot and that this is what true cinema should look like. You really don't need any spectacular scenes to make a great movie. A powerful, humbling and touching story like this one is more than enough and that's why I give this film a well deserved 9/10.",
         "I have seen several Ken Loach films in the past like BREAD AND ROSES and MY NAME IS JOE and I really think that Loach is one of the most talented directors around.His social films are very intense and miles away from your regular Hollywood or Pinewood movie. I thought that MY NAME IS JOE was an intense drama(and it is very much so)but LADYBIRD LADYBIRD is the absolute powerhouse of drama and despare.The acting performances of Crissy Rock and Vladimir Vega are so intense that it seems to be really happening.Loach uses a lot of unexperienced actors to play in his films and this time around it's no different.Both Rock and Vega make their cinema debut here.The fact that Loach uses these unfamiliar people enhances the reality of his films. The verbal fights between Rock and the social workers are almost unwatchable as are the fights she has with her former boyfriend. The way that Loach uses flashbacks to tell the story is very well done. Still there are some points of criticism.I know that the film is based on a true story but some things are not very realistic.For instance why should a political refugee of Paraguay start an affair with a sad and unbalanced woman from Mersy Side.Also the parts with the social workers are slightly overdone,but maybe it's the truth.If it is,then I'm afraid to say that these folks are absolutely cold hearted. LADYBIRD LADYBIRD is the most intense film I've ever seen.It's very hard to watch but even harder not to. 9/10"
