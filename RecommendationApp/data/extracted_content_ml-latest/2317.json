         "This was surprising, maybe I didn't expect much: just the usual somewhat stupid and sleazy comedy of today. Instead it was one of those films that IS a comedy for the most part, but in the last segment turns dramatic. The comedy in here is more subtle than normal and David Arquette does a nice job with, especially in one scene that is not-so-subtle. Just his stupid grin throughout the film was worth a few laughs. Stanley Tucci, meanwhile, is very convincing as as less-than-ethical salesman. Kate Capshaw makes the female lead role an attractive one. Without giving anything away, suffice to say this film is a bit different, not what you might think, and worth a look. I can say one thing for sure: it is no award-winner but it's better than most of these reviews would have you believe.",
         "How anyone can say anything bad about this film shocks me. It is what indie films should be. Funny, unique, amusing, well made, off-beat. Why did the studio bury it? I guess it's hard to sell a film when you knock off one of the main characters early in the film. But I think Dunsky (the writer-director) just did WHAT NEEDED to be done for the integrity of the film. Tucci is at his best when he is under Arquette's pressure. And watch out for Mary McCormack (Mrs. Howard Stern in PRIVATE PARTS) that lady can act! This movie was at many major film festivals and got some great reviews (that I dug up). Siskel and Ebert loved it (on their TV show only - for some reason they never wrote up a review of it). SEE THIS MOVIE but don't expect a juvenile comedy off the shelf from a major studio. Expect to be surprised and you'll have a good time.",
         "I was surprised by the number of times I caught myself smiling or laughing quietly during The Alarmist (AKA Life During Wartime), a film where the parts are definitely greater than the whole. Be prepared to all but ignore the plot, which is unnecessary except as a place to loosely hang some wonderful performances by everyone involved.",
         "Dark, humorous, quirky and melodramatic. The mix of this movie may not gel and disappoint some, but on the whole I found it fun and entertaining. Dave Arquette, Stan Tucci and Kate Capeshaw give fine performances in this very offbeat movie that starts dark but ends with a comedic twist. Perhaps the plot could be better but there's plenty enough to give viewers amusement and chuckles. A strange one you'd either hate or enjoy. For myself, I found it on the plus side.",
         "Loved it. Someone said the mark of a great mind is the capacity to hold two contradictory ideas in mind at the same time. It seems easiest for modern filmmakers to create a vision of humanity that is cynical/chilling or impossibly naive. I believe this film shares with Atom Egoyan's films, Milos Forman's late work, Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides and others, an essentially gentle but unclouded gentle view of humanity. From that, all things are possible: good satire, worthwhile commentary on the human condition, truly sexy scenes, all of which this film has. Consider the sex scene, once shocking, now a mainstay. When a film becomes trapped in either cynicism/dark brooding on one hand, or impossible romantic naivete on the other, it can no longer do anything but turn up the heat on accepted conventions. This film is not trapped in any such way. (See the scene in the kitchen when young Howard walks into the kitchen.)",
         "I had looked forward to seeing this film after reading about it, especially given Stanley Tucci's involvement. The first half of the film is quirky and interesting in it's \"Tin Men\" like overview of the home security sales business. However, the second half of the film veers sharply into post-Tarantino plot devices, none of which are remotely interesting or innovative. By the end of the film (and it's pointless prologue), I was thoroughly bored and ready to leave. Tucci is OK as the slimy proprietor but Arquette's one-note performance grew tiresome. Kate Capshwaw, who looks absolutely gorgeous, is wasted but Ryan Reynolds is outstanding as her son. His scene with Arquette in which he described his attempt at lovemaking was worth the price of admission. In fact, I would have preferred to see a movie about his character rather than Arquette's.",
         "This movie is about a novice security-system salesman (Arquette) who has an affair with one of his clients (Capshaw) and, when she and her son are murdered, comes to believe that his effluvial boss (Tucci) did the deed. This conviction comes to him after he's visited by Capshaw's spirit who advises him, \"Get the bastard.\" And, indeed, the talkative Tucci is not a palladium of morality. He kicks in doors to create incidents which in turn create fears in Los Angeles neighborhoods. And when he learns of a rich potential client's home being empty for a while, he's not above committing burglary. So when Capshaw and son die, Arquette -- enraged, half insane -- kidnaps Tucci and takes him to a deserted spot in the desert. Just before shooting him, he discovers that the real killer has been captured. He and Tucci make up and agree to work together again. Each of the individual scenes is pretty keenly observed. Nice little everyday details, amusing in their familiarity and even funnier when they stretch the envelope. The whole thing doesn't hang together very well. There's a major weakness in the plot -- Arquette's vision. Nothing has really prepared us for it. Arquette has never been crazy or anything other than a bit self conscious. And then in thirty seconds of screen time he turns delusional. Tucci's earnest logic -- he admits to being full of crap and a thief but he had absolutely nothing to gain by Capshaw's death -- makes no difference to Arquette, whose mind is made up. I know. This is beginning to sound like today's political arena. The movie is shot mostly in a classical style with little in the way of directorial dazzle, though there are a couple of overhead shots that are inconsistent with the rest, and one or two scene in something like step motion that don't belong there. As the central character, Arquette is given to over display but is otherwise unexceptional. The story is more or less held together by Stanley Tucci's performance and his mustache, a combination of British military and Groucho Marx. He's a splendid actor of considerable range. (Catch him in \"The Big Night.\") There is a lengthy sequence towards the end that has Tucci tied up on the desert floor and Arquette waving a pistol over him, about to kill him, and it's all made bearable by Tucci's response to the situation. He switches in an instant from squealing with terror to blustering self defense. Kate Capshaw gives another convincing performance. She's no longer the glamorized hero of adventure movies in which she's confronted with a dish of monkey brains. She's aged somewhat. She's beautiful, very sexy, and gives the best performance I've seen her in. It's not a poorly done film. Despite its weaknesses, it has its genuine moments. One of them is when Arquette is sitting in the living room, trying to sell his security system to an elderly couple, when the old dude suddenly leaps up and shouts that he has his OWN security system and breaks out his armory -- M-16, AK-47, a .357, a .454, and some grenades. (\"Maybe it's excessive,\" says the beaming little old lady who is his wife -- remonstrative, you know, but proud too.) The ending is completely incredible. It's like having a plug in your front tire, trying desperately to keep the air from escaping. And there's an unnecessary epilogue that I suppose was intended to be funny.",
         "I was at this film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the writer/director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any. Rarely has a film been so poorly directed (why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes?), wretchedly acted (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional gamut from A to B. He parks at A and brings a lunch) and utterly pointless. Characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. At long last, the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that's supposed to \"really make you think.\" Unfortunately, what it makes you think is, \"Well, there's 90 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.\"",
         "It's rather sad to see that so many people seem turned off by this comedy. Just like Romeo is Bleeding, too many people seem to just give up when they're finally shown something that truly creates an original tone for itself. This movie walks a tight-wire between the absurd and offbeat while still seemingly plausible and realistic. The plot twists with wonderfully subversive glee. I could not help but fall hopelessly in love with this charming movie. Don't listen to all the negative comments. Rent it and judge for yourself. You just might be wonderfully surprised.",
         "This movie is not what it looks like on the cover. This is a very funny - yet very serious - movie. (Get ready for an emotional rollercoaster ride.) The writing is simply brilliant and while it is at times quite baudy, it is always wonderfully sweet. The performances are stunning (who knew Kate Capshaw could be so funny?). Evan Dunsky is a director to watch..."
