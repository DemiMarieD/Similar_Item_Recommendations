         "More often that not, I'll call a movie overrated, but this one, I think, is underrated. It features solid acting and a very involving story. There isn't as much violence as most modern-day crime movies and that's fine because this story doesn't need it. The profanity is also lower-than-normal. All that's missing is better cinematography. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Armand Assante, Gabirel Byrne and William Hurt all make this interesting and provide good performances. This is a good attention-diverting movie that is a good \"date movie,\" too. It's tense without a ton of the usual overdone violence and profanity.",
         "A good cast and entertaining plot find themselves foiled by a pedestrian script and ludicrous conclusion in this rather old-fashioned pot-boiler. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer looks ravishing as the whiter-than-white single mum who, upon being called to jury duty, finds herself terrorised by the henchmen of the mobster defendant. Armand Assante plays the blacker-than-black gangster - a slick, sharply-dressed caricature if ever there was one - but manages to add some sparks of individuality to the role. Gabriel Byrne is the fiery-tempered, driven state prosecutor who is largely ineffectual throughout the picture (character, not actor) \u0096 think about it: he achieves nothing he sets out to do. Only William Hurt really makes a mark as Assante's ex-cop henchman assigned to put the frighteners on Whalley-Kilmer. Plagued by a nagging conscience, and a major case of the hots for JW-K, he is the only interesting character. Mind you, William Hurt makes every role he plays interesting. Although the plot is entertaining it is also filled with huge holes and some really silly twists that require a superhuman suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer. If you can manage it, though, you may find some enjoyment in this hokey thriller.",
         "Pirone (Armand Assante) is a mob boss being brought to trial by DA Graham (Gabriel Bryne). When the star witness is whacked Graham replaces him with another mob boss. Pirone targets once of the jury, a single mother Valerie (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) using dirty ex-cop Vesey (William Hurt) to get close to her. Valerie must hang the jury or risk her and her son being killed. This is a solid mob courtroom thriller with a edge. The story is interesting because you're not sure how Whalley-Kilmer will deal with the situations she is put in - it is quite tense for most of the movie. The actors are all good, Hurt especially plays against type with his shady dirty cop, Bryne does well but Whalley-Kilmer is not that good. Given the demands of the lead character Valerie it may have benefited from a better actress - that said she carries off the innocent single mother role convincingly. All the mob roles are played by actors who you'll see in lots of other gangster flicks including Goodfellas, The Sopranos etc. Some other interesting faces appear - William R. Moses of Perry Mason TVM \"fame\" appears as a jury, while David Cronenberg has a walk-on part as a film director. While Whalley-Kilmer doesn't totally convince in Valerie's character change towards the films conclusion the majority of the plot holds together well. If you've seen Demi Moore in \"The Juror\" then this is similar in plot but \"Trial by Jury\" is a much stronger film.",
         "I discovered this film while searching for laserdiscs. It's a good way to find forgotten gems. TBJ is a crime film that never becomes tiresome mostly due to the fantastic emotionally alluring portrayal of a single mom by Joanne Whalley. She's your average girl stuck in a mess with a megalomaniac king pin. Fortunately for the viewer her body is not average, giving her character that added, \"I don't know I'm sexy\" vibe. Armand Assante turns in a great performance as he easily puts out charm and terror with a simple stoic glance. The root of the film which is the two worlds colliding, gets delivered with believability. The real gritty hoots of the film are William Hurt playing a twisted x cop that still has remnants of good in him and the ever delectable Kathleen Quinlan as a quirky sot. I really liked the script. The seedy undercurrent feel that the film has is captured with words that give an inner chuckle and a solid outer grimace. Some courtroom antics are quite stagey but those scenes can be muscled through if you like the genre. TBJ is not a routine crime thriller and throws some very interesting entertainment punches.",
         "This film is so much better than The Juror. William Hurt is outstanding as a conflicted man, Kathleen Quinlan is amazingly creepy in her role, the tension between Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and the others, Armand Assante in particular, is emotional and well done. You will feel her isolation and fear. You will feel Gabriel Byrne's frustration as he tries to catch the mob boss and and work within the law only to have the legal system perverted by the influence of that mob. You will see how his character, who grew up with the mobster (Assante) could easily have gone in that direction. It has a great supporting cast with people like Joe Santos, Ed Lauter and Margaret Whitton. The film is also done in a film noir style. If you like classy films, you'll love it.",
         "Am I the only person that thinks this movie is waaaaay to similar to \"The Juror\" with Demi Moore? Let's see, let's start with jury intimidation, young son threatened, rape. I always thought this movie was a very good movie but I'm amazed that there is not a stronger association of the two movies in IMDB.",
         "\"Trial By Jury\" is one of the better psychological thrillers I have seen because it sucks the viewer in with each scene. As I began to watch this film I noticed that it had elements of \"12 Angry Men\" and \"The Juror,\" both of which were great movies, therefore I knew this would be of the same caliber. The film stars Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and William Hurt. They all bring a style to the film that can only be matched by the brilliant ways of making it believable. I found all the actors were playing a different from what they were accustomed to, which was a real treat because if actors play the same thing over and over it gets boring. This a legal thriller that plays around with the mind and when movies do this you can only hang on for the ride. Kilmer delivers an awesome performance as the terrified juror. It made me sit up and take a look at how talented she is. For example, in the climax of the movie she is at her best, but you will have to see the movie. Speaking of performances, the one turned in by Gabriel Byrne made me a fan of his work because he showed that he has a passion making movies and making them good. In \"Trial By Jury\" he never let up in his pursuit of justice. \"Trial By Jury\" was a very slow movie but it is well worth the wait. I hope everyone likes it as much as I did.",
         "In New York, Valerie Alston (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) is a single woman, who has a small son and is the owner of a store of clothes. She is convoked to participate of the jury of the trial of the mobster Rusty Pirone (Armand Assante), who will be judged for several murders. In the eve, the key witness of the prosecutor Daniel Graham (Gabriel Byrne) was executed with the four police officers that were protecting him by Pirone's men. Meanwhile, the ex-cop Tommy Vesey (William Hurt), who also works for Pirone, threatens Valerie, menacing to kill her son if she does not claim that Pirone is not guilty. \"Trial by Jury\" is not a bad movie, but it could have been a great film-noir. The first three-quarters of the story are indeed excellent. But there are two weaknesses in this film: the first one is the performance of Joanne Whalley-Kilmer. The character of Valerie lives a terrible dramatic dilemma and a very conflictive situation between her consciousness and the request of the mobster, and demanded a more expressive actress. Unfortunately, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer keeps the same expression in the most different situations along the story. The second weak point is the conclusion of the story, which is too much \"Hollywoodian\" to be credible. Anyway, this film is a good entertainment. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Tribunal Sob Suspeita\" (\"Tribunal Under Suspicion\")",
         "I thought the movie was good, but felt all the leading characters (with the exception of Armand Assante as the mob boss) were badly miscast. One of the essential elements of the plot was the mob boss's obsession for the juror, because he had a thing for classy women who looked like movie stars from the 1940s. Although Joanne Whalley is an excellent actress and always a beautiful on-screen presence, I don't feel she fit the 1940s mold, and didn't seem to have much on-screen chemistry with Assante. Another actress such as Kim Basinger (in a pre-LA Confidential Veronica Lake type of performance) might have made that plot element more believable. William Hurt was also miscast as the crooked cop. After seeing Tom Berenger in \"Breaking Point\" he would have been a much better choice. Gabriel Byrne and Kathleen Quinlan's roles could have been played by Treat Williams and Kelly Preston. Other than the casting of the lead actors, I liked the look of the film (photography, set design, costumes, etc.) and enjoyed watching it. I thought it was a much better film than \"The Juror\" (with Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin) that had a similar theme and was released the same year.",
         "Trial By Jury isn't a bad movie or anything but it's fairly predictable and isn't really a must see. The best thing about the movie is Joane Whaley in the lead role. The similarities to \"The Juror\" have been noted here so I won't get into that. This movie is part court drama part wanna be thriller. I say \"wanna be\" because it's not that original. I'm not saying the movie doesn't scare because it does. I mean there are some genuinely creepy moments. But it's that try to scare type of fear, the type where you kind of respond automatically. I saw it on television and it does hold your Attention so it's not a bad pick for a lazy Sunday. Trial By Jury also, at least to me, felt a bit like a movie one would find on the lifetime network. (Not that I'm putting down the lifetime channel-I actually dig many of their movies.) But it has that feel. The acting is actually quite good and Whaley brings a Special something to the role. She's a very CLASSY actress and that does kind of elevate the movie. Her being in the lead role is definitely a strong point of the movie. The movie Trial By Jury is not a must see.(I'd rate it about a 5.5) but not unwatchable and good for watching on a rainy day or if you like courtroom dramas."
