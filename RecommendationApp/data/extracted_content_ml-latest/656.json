         "This is a comedy-fantasy, people -- not a documentary. The pacing is bouncy and rollicking. The performances are precisely what they should be -- neither \"villain\" is one-dimensional or over-the-top, but just menacing enough in the right amounts, and the ways in which Eddie triumphs over each of them are quite clever. Mayor Koch's cameo is hysterical, as is the bit with Stacey's Mom. Ostertag shows good comic timing. The background of Eddie is just touching enough without being maudlin. The transition of the Knicks from selfish losers to re-motivated winners is handled just right for a comedy-fantasy. This is at least in a class with Angels In The Outfield as an enjoyable comedy-fantasy.",
         "Eddie: Just about a pro team overcoming obstacles that many teams face in a season. Basketball is my favorite sport. Rick Fox is my favorite actor. So this is definitely one of my favorite movies. There are so many good \"life\" points in the movie. Whoppi Goldberg is great in this movie and it is filled with a lot of stars without the movie being egotistical and whatnot. It is just a feel good movie with a lot of funny bits. And I watch it because of Goldberg, Fox and Malik Sealy who was so good in this movie and who was killed a while after it was released. It will keep you laughing non-stop and the music is good as well. I hope this is helpful.",
         "When the New York Knicks are in the middle of a really poor run when they are purchased by a new owner, Wild Bill Burgess. In an attempt to get the fans into the Garden, he arranges a `honorary coach' contest which fan Eddie Franklin wins. She takes to the bench pushing Coach Bailey's patience to breaking point. When Wild Bill sees the fans react to Eddie he lets Bailey walk and gives her the job. When she turns the losing streak around the team starts to change but what is Wild Bill's financial plan for the Knicks? As a Knicks fan I am used to seeing them play rubbish and `snatch defeat from the jaws of victory' so I didn't think it would hurt to watch this film \u0096 at least in this fictional film they stand a chance of a playoff berth! The plot is quite silly in essence, and very unlikely but it is used well to create jokes and good basketball action. The jokes are a mix of Goldberg's usual stuff as well as New York & NBA in-jokes. The Goldberg stuff is OK if you like her, I always liked her smart mouth so I enjoyed it. The in-jokes and cameos also help the film. Be it Letterman, the Mayor or a host of NBA stars, the film is carried by these until it realises that it needs to get an actual plot to finish on! At one point I feared a romantic interest but was happy to see that dropped and a plot about Wild Bill's plans brought into play instead. This isn't great but it does OK and provides a good enough framework for Goldberg's wise mouth and lots of NBA cameos! The cast is deep in players, some knicks, most not, some knicks-to-be! Johnson, Jackson, Rodman, Patton, Mouges, Rick Fox and so on, they all play a good part in the film and the `oh look it's' effect helps keep the interest. Of course many jokes do fall flat and the overall narrative is pretty weak, but the film is a fun diversion. As a knicks fan I did enjoy it on that level but I also felt it wasn't a bad way to spend 90 minutes. It has a watchable energy and is worth seeing if you like basketball and are in an undemanding mood.",
         "Eddie isn't the best movie ever made, but it's perfect for watching on a lazy afternoon. It's one of those unpretentious Whoopi Goldberg comedies that bring a smile to your face. Whoopi plays Eddie, a loud-mouthed New York Knicks fan who through dumb luck becomes head coach. Expect lots of cameos from real NBA players and wooden acting from those same players (There are many howlers by \"Preacher\" a.k.a. B-baller Mark Jackson). Overall, a pleasant diversion not meant for film snobs. 7/10",
         "After winning free-throw contest at a New York Knicks basketball game, b-ball fanatic Whoopi Goldberg is pegged to be the last place team's new coach! She whips the boys into shape...but is she just being used as a publicity clown? Cookie-cutter movie (with a script cobbled together from work by seven different writers!) is saddled with a limp third act, very little substance overall, and one-dimensional supporting characters. However, director Steve Rash wisely allows Whoopi to be Whoopi, and her contagious good spirit rises above the mire and is enjoyable. The takeover sub-plot really sinks this comedy-fantasy in the end, but Goldberg is a trouper and offers several hearty laughs. ** from ****",
         "This is arguably one of Whoppi's best movies. It's also a well done movie overall. It's an unassuming comedy that focuses more on positive characters and the better aspects of humanity than on controversy and good versus evil. It's a movie that you can watch with the entire family, especially children. Whoppi's character is a woman obsessed with the New York Knicks and through a convergence of an unusual and unlikely set of circumstances, becomes the coach of the team. Her admirable ability to see good in everyone and a lack of guile makes her a leader who steers the people around her towards victory in their lives as well as on the court. There is some genuine pathos in the movie as well as some loads of human to human interactions that are heartwarming and, yes, again, positive that will leave you satisfied and feeling pretty good. It'll turn that frown upside down.",
         "I saw this film about a week ago. It's about a die hard New York Knicks fan named Edwina she becomes cursed with lousy seats, a bad team, and a boss who doesn't understand her obsession. In a contest to see to be the new coach for the Knicks Edwina wins the contest she's a bit pushy at first but she then goes a little easier on the players. The owner badly wants Edwina to sell the Knicks but the fans say boo to the game when Wild Bill tells her to get off the court. But she refuses at the next game she also teaches the players that they have fans that care for them. They go from a lousy team to a really good team they also win the championship game by a score of 99-98. It is a depressing loss for Carolina. Check it out you may like it.",
         "Movie concept: Promising. Actors: Goldberg perfect for the role. Script: 6 writers couldn't put something together with a tighter script than this????? This film has a pretty low rating on IMDb, and I'm not surprised. Although the concept was pretty good, the execution was sloppy...just about as sloppy as the team was during the first half of the film. I had the idea throughout the film that most people involved were just going through the motions. That's not to say there aren't some good moments here. There are some good laughs. Occasionally Whoppi shines like I expected her to shine. It's all pretty good natured, and some of the cameos by politicians and others are fun. Whoopi does fairly well in the lead. Although it's hardly his finest hour, Frank Langella is decent as the new Texan club owner. And Dennis Farina is fine as the old and opposing coach. But there was no danger here of anyone winning an Oscar or Golden Globe. It's a couple of hours of fun, but I'd never be tempted to watch it a second time.",
         "I'll try to keep this short and to the point. This is not a complex drama, not was it meant to be. As a previous reviewer pointed out, the pacing is quick and timely. On some levels, you could view this as a moral tale. The good guys win in the end. The heroine puts out a max effort, remains true to her values, but also discovers her view of the situation was a bit too simple. (Perhaps as many of us have a tendency towards?). As in life, a little attitude and approach adjustment, and she zeroes in on the goal. The willingness to risk failing, however, remaining steadfast to her morals, provides the final tension that is resolved with the cathartic victory in the end.",
         "Eddie starring Whoppi Goldberg is a product of the tremendous interest generated by the game of Basketball in the 90s in the USA, mostly because of the jazz and excitement of the game and players like Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman etc who drew in large crowds and made the NBA big business. The best feature about this film is it does not take itself seriously from the beginning. There fun poked at greedy players, foreign imports and egotistical coaches! The film itself is about a huge fan of the New York Knicks who becomes coach of the New York Knicks by becoming close to the new owner of the Knicks Wild Bill Burgess( Frank Langella) The cameos in the film are plentiful and while MJ himself does not make an appearance it gives a funny insight into what its like to be on the court and what makes players tick. One shot of John Salley making a free throw is very striking and would send a shiver down any sports fan of any sport. Its not a blue chips type basketball film, its a comedy/sports movie that is easy to watch and thats why i am giving it a 7! P.S look out for a rare cameo from Leroy from Fame as a dancer!"

The team is struggling with a mediocre record when, in mid-season, \"Wild Bill\" Burgess, the new owner, as a public relations gimmick, stages an 'honorary coach' contest, which Eddie wins. The fans love it, so \"Wild Bill\" fires the coach and hires her. She takes the bunch of overpaid prima donnas that make up the team and turns them around. But the owner hopes to move the team, now the darling of the New York fans, to St. Louis. He may OWN the team, but it BELONGS to the city and the fans!"],
