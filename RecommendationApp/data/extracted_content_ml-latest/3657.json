In a little spanish seaport named Esperanza, during the 30s, appears Hendrick van der Zee, the mysterious captain of a yacht (he is the only one aboard). Pandora is a beautiful woman (who men kill and die for). She's never really fallen in love with any man, but she feels very attracted by Hendrick... We are soon taught that Hendrick is the Flying Dutchman, this sailor of the 17th century that has been cursed by God to wander over the seas until the Doomsday... unless a woman is ready to die for him...",

      "synopsis": "In Spain, 1930, beautiful PANDORA REYNOLDS, an American chanteuse, drives every man to distraction. They fall in love with her, yet few can possess her. One such suitor, REGGIE, even poisons himself. Pandora's friends include archeologist GEOFFREY and his niece JANET. Eventually, Pandora agrees to marry race-car driver STEPHEN, whom she asks to prove his love by making him push his beloved race car off a cliff. But Pandora later spots a mysterious yacht at sea. She tosses off her clothing and swims to it, finding a solitary man on board, HENDRICK van der ZEE, a Dutchman, who's currently painting a portrait of the legendary Pandora. The real Pandora sees that she looks exactly the same. Clearly attracted to the melancholy, handsome Hendrick, Pandora makes a dinner date with him. Later, Geoffrey asks Hendrick to translate a Dutch legend, which turns out to be the legend of The Flying Dutchman, and we see it acted out. Convinced his wife Pandora has been unfaithful, the Dutchman kills her. When asked at his trial if he has anything to say, he blasphemes, declaring that Heaven is a lie, and asking that if he be wrong, God may do what He pleases with his immortal soul. That night, the door to his prison cell is mysteriously left open, and the Dutchman returns to his ship and sleeps. As he sleeps, a heavenly voice tells him that his wife was not unfaithful after all, and that he is cursed to sail his ship alone forever with a ghostly crew, unable to die, the curse unending until he finds a woman whose love is strong enough to die for him. He is allowed to go onshore every seven years to search for this woman. Pandora walks in as Hendrick finishes the translation, and she senses something is wrong with the deeply conflicted Hendrick. And indeed, we learn that Hendrick is the fabled Flying Dutchman, and he believes that Pandora is the reincarnation of his beloved. Meanwhile, Pandora's other suitor, JUAN MATALVO, a famous matador, returns to town, not happy that Pandora is engaged. Later, he sees Pandora kissing Hendrick, and he burns with jealousy. Hendrick is now certain he's found his lost love, but when Pandora tells him that she would give up her life for him, Hendrick intentionally angers her, sending her away in tears, realizing that he loves her too much for her to give up her life. Meanwhile, matador Juan Mantalvo wants Pandora to marry him, not racecar driver Stephen. Juan Mantalvo sneaks up on Hendrick one night, stabbing him, watching him fall to the floor, hoping that with Hendrick out of the way, Pandora will give up Stephen and marry him instead. But Hendrick cannot be killed, given the curse, and he gets up after Mantalvo leaves. At the big bullfight, Mantalvo performs with his usual skills. When he sees Hendrick taking a seat in the grandstands, however, Mantalvo, believing he has seen a ghost, is distracted long enough for the bull to gore him before the horrified crowd. He later dies, after telling Pandora the truth. Hendrick returns to his ship, but Pandora, realizing the truth, swims out and joins him. The two realize how fate has intended them for each other, and Pandora frees him from the curse by telling him she would die for him. And so, now a terrible storm comes up, wrecking the ship, and the two lovers-Pandora and the Flying Dutchman-are found dead on the beach in each other's arms.",

         "This tragic legendary story of the Flying Dutchman is expertly woven into a wonderful drama about the tale of a beautiful but spoiled destructive lover, night club singer Pandora Reynolds, the beautiful femme fatal played by Ava Gardner. Already giving her hand in marriage to racing car driver Stephen Cameron played by Nigel Patrick she meets the mystical owner of a strange yacht, played outstandingly by James Mason, which is anchored in the port off Esperanza Spain. She is immediately attracted to him and finds a new meaning to her life abandoning her selfish, spiteful deceit with her past life and her other suitors including jealous bull fighter Mario Cabre who kills Mason not knowing he has immortality and where Mason then shows up at a bullfight shocking the performing Cabre, and distracting him so, that he mortally wounded by an attacking bull. Harold Warrender as archaeologist Geoffrey Fielding provides a brilliant narration of this story throughout the movie and holds it together with gentleman expertise. The final part of this movie is absolutely moving with the fatal love scene between Mason and Gardner culminating in the cracked hour glass in which they succumb to their mortal qualities in a storm where their lives are consumed and he is released from his imposed curse of wandering the seven seas for an eternity until he could find a woman who was prepared to die for him. This movie was too far ahead of it's time to be fully appreciated by the audiences of the day. This superb story and direction by Albert Lewin makes it a lost classic. Bring it back.",
         "Albert Lewin's 1951 movie injects the Flying Dutchman legend into an upper-class English-speaking community in a small port in 1930s Spain. Ava Gardner, never more beautiful and just about to emerge as a star, is the Pandora of the title, a night-club singer and femme fatale, engaged to be married to a gentlemanly racing car driver (Nigel Patrick), but with a hotheaded bullfighter (Mario Cabré) eager to win her. Enter the Flying Dutchman, Hendrick van der Zee, trying to find a woman willing to give up her life for him so he can gain release from his eternal roving of the seas. James Mason's performance as Hendrick is one of the main salvations of the movie. With his grace, good looks and wonderfully expressive voice, he is able to give credibility to situations and lines that would be fatal for other actors. But the film's prime asset is its visual richness. At a straightforward level there is lovely Mediterranean scenery, and some great action sequences, notably the flamenco dancing, land-speed record, and bullfight scenes. Then there are quite a few references to surreal art, matching the surreal nature of the film, such as Hendrick's Chirico-like painting of Pandora, and a remarkable shot of her, lying on her back with the profile of her face in close-up, like a Dali painting. (The film is set on the Costa Brava, near Dali's home town of Cadaques.) And throughout, there is Jack Cardiff's creative camerawork in beautiful technicolor. These visual qualities outweigh such flaws as an intrusive voice-over, and the stress laid on the - for me - irrelevant \"Moving Finger\" quatrain from the Rubaiyat.",
         "I was an usher in the Paramount Theater in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania when this film came out. That's when ushers were ushers! I must have seen the picture 30 times while working. The picture was not popular at the time -- and I had a heck of a time understanding it. But I do remember being fascinated by the scenery. The film was initially promoted as \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\" -- but when it came to the Paramount, they changed the name to \"The Loves of Pandora\". I have no clue why that change was made -- but I remember that the revised title as it appeared on the screen was sort of \"home made\" and not of the quality of a new film. Were they experimenting with changing the name to get more patrons? I have not read anything about this anywhere on the internet. I have always been curious about this picture and intend to rent it to see it now that I'm 75 years old and may understand it at this stage of my life -- a full 58 years after seeing it at the Paramount.",
         "Albert Lewin's work as director had not impressed me prior to seeing \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\" I found myself frankly quite bored by his version of Maugham's \"The Moon and Sixpence\" as well as \"The Private Affairs of Bel Ami\". \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has quite the reputation, but I unfortunately haven't seen it yet. 'Exceeded expectations' cannot begin to describe how surprised I was at how absorbing, intense, captivating, and utterly gorgeous \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\" is. Sure, there are flaws, mostly in the script which occasionally seems to think it's smarter than it actually is and goes for the sort of intrusive voice-over narration that never fails to annoy, but also in scenes where Lewin's decisions as director become frustrating and in the score which is generally quite good but often overbearing. Regardless of its flaws, \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\" is a literate, creative, fairly original, and exceptionally well-acted film, with the exceptional feature of being photographed by Jack Cardiff OBE, who was on quite a run going into this film having photographed the three Powell/Pressburger classics from the 40's: \"A Matter of Life and Death\", \"Black Narcissus\", and \"The Red Shoes\" as well as the underrated if not exactly great 1949 Hitchcock offering \"Under Capricorn\". James Mason and Ava Gardner are really excellent here in the lead roles. I was not looking forward to \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\" but I found myself very pleasantly surprised by it. It's far from a perfect film but I did find it to be quite excellent; even the melodrama that tends to bother me in romances from this era of film worked in the context of this film. A surprisingly good film, overall. 8/10",
         "There is much to enjoy in this legendary tale. The story is well told and quickly grabs the viewer. I thought the Spanish setting was perfect and the land speed record and bullfighting scenes in the main convincingly shot. The extraordinary use of Technicolor gives the whole picture an almost dream like ethereal look and many scenes have an almost surreal quality. The whole cast are splendid with Ava Gardner particularly spellbinding - I can't think of any actress today who could carry her role as convincingly.",
         ".... cause ,though a bit too long,\"Pandora\" is an unique film .It is part of those movies in which love refutes everything ,including space and time.It is continuously constructed and when it's over we have the strange feeling of having come full circle. \"Pandora\" is wrapped in mystery and it renewed the genre which \"Peter Ibbetson \"and \"portrait of Jennie\" had pioneered in the thirties and late forties which \"Somewhere in Time\" (based on a Richard Matheson novel) would continue in the eighties. Ava Gardner,the most beautiful woman of that era (and for me the most beautiful woman of all time) is ideally cast as the female lead.Who else could play such a gorgeous creature ?James Mason gives a tormented heartrending performance. Albert Lewin made few movies but the best of them (the picture of Dorian Gray\" \"the private Affairs of Bel-Ami\" ) are worth seeking out.The only real horror is \"Saadia\" which even Michel Simon could not redeem. Ava Gardner and James Mason would play another legendary couple (real this time):Francis-Joseph and Elisabeth of Austria.(\"Mayerling\",Terence Young,1968)",
         "You must make your own mind up here. This a rare movie but classic discovery. James Mason will disturb you as the Flying Dutchman. Ava Gardnar tries to be the star but Mason will remove you into the make believe world, that is the quality of this movie. We don't see Mason for a while and we see Gardner a lot but this is a treat for the reasons that movies were made for. Its just beautiful and other comments like 'sentimental' or 'pretentious' are really stupid here. This is great cinema like it should be. Of course nonesense but this is a world created successfully by the celluloid which is the whole purpose. Brilliant.",
         "Albert Lewin's independently produced and directed UK film PANDORA AND THE FLYING DUTCHMAN (1951) is one of the most ethereal and haunting love stories ever filmed. Lewin directs with a keen vision and doesn't often stray from the ethereal atmosphere, to the viewers delight. We get truly superb performances by the entire cast, particularly Ava Gardner, who delivers a heart-felt and very memorable performance. Not to mention the other-worldly photography, which is beautifully shot by two-time Oscar winner, the master cinematographer, Jack Cardiff (BLACK NARCISSUS,THE RED SHOES). Another major addition to this film is the musical score by classical composer Alan Rawsthorne, which is dream-like and uplifting, yet blended with a sense of melancholy. The score also blends poetically with the other-worldly visual richness to extraordinary effect. Fans of classic fantasy films are sure to be delighted. Highly recommended.",
         "For viewers from the age of the rock video, this movie is slow, and the direction is poor. But it's worth hanging with it. It will catch you up in a story that is gripping and ethereal. Ava Gardner, one of the sexiest stars in the history of Hollywood, is at her sexiest, and a young James Mason is at his best.",
         "Well, this has been on my most-wanted list for years now and it didn't disappoint me. What a lovely, romantic, ethereal and strange movie. James Mason is the Dutchman of the title, who murdered his beloved wife hundreds of years ago when he thought she had been unfaithful (she hadn't). He is doomed to sail the Seven Seas until he can find a woman willing to die for him. That woman appears as Pandora Reynolds, played by a ravishing Ava Gardner. Pandora entrances every man she meets but something is missing in her life, and her relationship with Mason's Hendrik brings her to learn the meaning of undying love and the sacrifices we might make. Occasionally the film lapses into pretension, thinking it's a bit clever for itself. The voice-over jars a bit at times, and some of the dialogue is very flowery and oh-so-mystical. But it's still a great film because it creates an atmosphere so unlike any other. I believe the print is in major need of restoration because I can't fathom how a Jack Cardiff-photographed film could look so poor in some places (Mason's teeth etc). It's very romantic, and I loved the flashback to when Mason killed his beautiful wife. It really shouldn't work, because it's very dramatic and a bit too orchestrated, but it does because Mason's acting is so terrific. I swear I love him more every time I see him."
