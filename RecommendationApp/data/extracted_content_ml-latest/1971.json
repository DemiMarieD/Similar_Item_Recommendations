      "synopsis": "Kristen, Joey and Kincaid have been released from the Westin Hills Asylum and are now living normal lives and attending high school. Kristen has managed to make some new friends: Alice, a young, bright girl who is a frequent daydreamer; Sheila, a brainy, quiet black girl with asthma; and Debbie, a tall, tough girl who hates bugs. She has also found herself a boyfriend, Rick, a martial arts enthusiast who is also Alice's brother. Kristen begins to have bad dreams and feels as though Freddy has once again come back from the dead. During one of her nightmares, she pulls Kincaid and Joey into her dream as she explores the deserted Elm Street house. In school the next day, Kincaid and Joey confront Kristen about pulling them into the dream. Kincaid wakes up one night and finds himself locked in the trunk of an old junked car. When he opens the hood, he realizes that he is in the same salvage yard that Freddy's body was buried in. Kincaid spies his dog, Jason, digging and urinating in the ground nearby. Freddy then resurrects from the ground after which a pile of junked cars crash down on him. Freddy quickly recoups and kills Kincaid. Later that night Joey is also killed by Freddy. The following day at school, Kristen is concerned when her friends fail to show up for class. She confides to Alice about nightmares. Kristen hits her head and passes out when she discovers both her friends missing, being attacked by Freddy but revived in time. After she learns of the deaths of Kincaid and Joey, Kristen goes to the actual Elm Street house, with Rick, Dan, and Alice. Rick tells Dan the story of Freddy, and Alice reveals a part of the dream master spell. Alice suggests to Kristen that she is in control of her own dreams. However, Alice also looks down at the ground and sees something, a chalk drawing of the house, that only Kristen has been able to see. Clearly, she senses something. At home that night, her mother gives her a sedative to help her sleep. When Kristen falls asleep this time, on Alice's advice, she tries to convert nightmares into pleasant dreams, to no avail. While she meets a child named Alice in her dream, creating a sand castle, even in her good dreams, Freddy appears and ruins everything. Kristen eventually finds herself in Freddy's boiler room. It is explained that Kristen is the last child from Elm Street, and Freddy needs her help to get more children. When Freddy is about to kill her, she screams for Alice. Alice appears suddenly in the boiler room just as Krueger kills Kristen by throwing her into fire. Before Kristen dies, she sends her power, the power to pull people into her dreams, to Alice. Before the power can reach her, it passes through Freddy first. Alice awakens immediately, realizing that Kristen's in danger. She turns out to be right, as Kristen's room is on fire. As Alice tries to understand what has happened, and who exactly Freddy is, her friends begin to die. First, Sheila and Rick are killed. While taking a test, Alice accidentally pulls Sheila into a dream where Freddy is waiting; the same thing happens to Rick later. Yet, after every death, including Kristen's, Alice picks up new talents and abilities. She also picks up the dream powers of the children who have died. She is obviously Freddy's supernatural opposite, albeit too weak to truly conquer or even resist him yet. After his death, Alice teams up with Dan Jordan, who was one of Rick's closest friends. Together with Dan, Alice tries to get to Debbie, their last surviving friend, before Freddy finds her. Unbeknown to the two teens, Freddy is able to control their movements. Trapping Alice and Dan in a time loop, Freddy is able to reach Debbie and kill her (by transforming her into a cockroach and trapping her inside a roach motel and then crushing her) before Alice and Dan intervene. Following a car accident, where Dan is injured and rushed to the hospital, Alice returns home to prepare for one final battle with Freddy. Alice goes to sleep to help Dan before Freddy can kill him. As Alice and Dan search for Freddy, Dan is injured. Alice wills him awake right at the moment the doctors wake Dan and he is pulled from the dreamworld. Alice, facing Freddy alone, attempts to use all of her newly absorbed abilities against him. The fight is relatively equal, except that she has a mortal body and he has not, giving him the advantage of immortality. It's an advantage that proves nearly too great to overcome. He declares that he's been guarding his gate for too long to be taken down by her. But just as he is preparing to kill her, she recalls the final verse of the dream master spell. For the first and only time, someone defeats Freddy, by using the power of the spell to make him see the evil that is inside. Using her power as guardian of the gate of good dreams (which Kristen never was, nor was Nancy,) Alice releases the tortured souls that Freddy imprisoned into the gates of good dreams where he can no longer harm them. Krueger's clothes fall lifelessly to the floor. The film ends with Dan and Alice at a fountain some time later. She tosses a coin in and makes a wish. As she and Dan depart, she decides to keep the wish to herself as Freddy's image appears in the ripples left in the fountain from the tossed coin.",

         "A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, the fourth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I was lucky enough to get the boxed DVD set of Nightmare on Elm Street series and I just finished all the sequels and while the fourth isn't a bad sequel or continuation of the story, it was pretty silly. It was cool to continue on with the dream warriors who were clever enough to defeat Freddy in the third Nightmare on Elm Street. But Freddy's back and he is more ticked off than ever and you know that's not good. But while the story was a good idea, the way it was executed, I wasn't really that into it, just the acting I think is what killed it for me. The way the movie was made was what made it feel like it was more of a cheesy TV show like on the Sci-fi Channel than an actual movie. We start off where the third installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series left off, the kids from the hospital are now grown up and are all on their own. But they are quickly killed off by Freddy hoping to get Kirsten back to help them, but they are too late. But when Kirsten finds a girl, Alice, she finds out that Alice has the same powers as she does. She has the ability to pull other people into her dreams and of course Alice is scared to find out how to use her powers, but she may just have to use them since Freddy is now after her and other kids too. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master was a good enough sequel, but it just could have been better. I liked it, but so far it's not my top favorite sequel. Again, we've got some very cool deaths, don't think I could choose one, I think the water bed one was very cool. But once again, I don't wanna spoil it. Of course if you wanna see the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, this is recommended, but as a horror movie on it's own, it's OK. 6/10",
         "This doesn't have the well-known cast of the previous Nightmare 3 movie but the special effects are still good.....each very different and some of them very funny. They make this perhaps the most entertaining entry in the series. Memorable scenes include a junkyard, a water bed, a classroom, faces in a pizza, a girl bench pressing and faces coming out of Freddy's flesh. The storyline, however, features its usual dumb and ridiculous theology and has its usual share of unlikable obnoxious teens. Their parents weren't pictured as any better, perhaps worse. In fact, the kids and parents are so bad you wind up rooting for Freddy to do them in. Perhaps that's the idea!",
         "This is the first elm street film I saw and it fascinated me back then. Of course I was only 10 at that time but it still is great. The flick is not scary like the original, but is more grotesque. Robert Englund is excellent as Freddy Krueger because he enjoys playing that character. You always sense Krueger presence with his twisted nightmares. Dark humor is my taste and I always laugh when he pops his quotes: \"You shouldnt have buried me; I'm not dead!\" \"Now how's that for a wet dream?\" \"Welcome to Wonderland, Alice!\" There are a few things that blows; Patricia Arquette should have been recast as Kirsten Parker and the resurrection is a bit lame but then the S/F effects rocks, the director likes action scenes and the music is well above average for a 1998 film. Definetly recommended",
         "Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2) directs Dream Master, the fourth entry in the franchise about a maniacal dreamstalker named Freddy Kruger. The entry is extremely passable and enjoyable. The survivors of Dream Warriors are still haunted by memories of Freddy Kruger. But Freddy isn't quite dead as he picks up his glove and takes up where he left off...with vengeance. The only flaw in his plan: a shy outcast named Alice who harbors powers that will enable her to do battle with Kruger as she assumes qualities of past Freddy victims. Although some of the more interesting characters are sacrificed first, the Nightmare franchise proves to be deeper and more original than any other slasher series around. Some inventive deaths and imagery on display as Robert Englund devours the scenery as Freddy.",
         "I make no apologies on awarding A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 5/5 stars. And I certainly don't consider it a \"guilty pleasure.\" Let's say I grew up on this movie. It was one of my initial \"Movie Event of the Year\" films as I watched it 5 times in the theatre in 1988, all at the now defunct AMC Gateway. (Twice alone, twice with my sister and the final time with my father who wanted to know what \"evil\" I was watching so many times.) Also, since I was so young (14, and I am puzzled on how I frequently got into a rated R flick \u0096 even my sister was younger than 17) not only was this my first introduction to Freddy \u0096 I hadn't seen 1-3 yet, this movie made a huge impact on my future movie-going experiences as well as my life. It's strange to even think about rewarding a #4 in a 1980s horror franchise more than, say 2½ stars, but I absolutely loved this movie. The soundtrack (which I had bought and have listened to hundreds of times, we'll get more on that later), the score, the comedic tones, the frights, the fights, the inventiveness and the acting. They really up'd the ante this time with an obvious budget and special effects. But more so, Freddy finally came out of the closet, so to speak. Not only was he absolutely hilarious, we finally got to see more of him and his glove. I obviously didn't know at the time how privileged the audience was to finally see him out of the shadows and into the limelight where he (and his clever one-liners) belong. I guess some might have problem with that \u0096 they probably felt he was more \"scary\" hidden away. I didn't. I felt he was too strong of a character not to show. Well, Freddy's back, but mostly because Kristen (the newly replaced Tuesday Knight, due to Arquette being pregnant, and Knight also did the wonderful opening song) couldn't leave well enough alone and kept thinking of him in her dreams. She also has a bad knack for involving others in her dreams, including #3's survivors Joey & Kincaid. When Freddy eventually stalks them and murders them (including one of the series most memorable/creative death \u0096 \"How's this for a wet dream?\") the series actually keeps continuity by stating Freddy's mission was to murder all of the original \"Elm Street Children\" and these were the final three. Kristen does manage to transfer her power of pulling someone into the dream to another innocent she pulled into the dream, Alice (Wilcox.) Positive: this gives someone else the opportunity to defeat Freddy. Negative: most likely Freddy would've been done with his task complete. Alice, sweet Alice, doesn't know what to think of all this, barely being informed of the back story earlier. In fact, had she been a little more prepared, she might not of inadvertently brought her friends into her own dreams for Freddy to collect souls. As Alice attempts to put the pieces together there's another side effect \u0096 just like with Kristen, she collects their powers, or personalities, habits (smoking, bad!) and strengths. Freddy's not stupid and plans to stop her before she stops him. Does he succeed? Does she happen to remember an old nursery rhyme at the most opportune time to defeat the man of their nightmares? Duh. I loved this movie on so many levels. I have the entire movie memorized, shot-by-shot, frame-by-frame and all the dialogue in between. So much so, I have to consciously stop myself from quoting it so I can enjoy the 30th time viewing it. I loved the soundtrack, but some songs were vacant. For those, I had to search \u0096 way pre-internet \u0096 by asking around school while just humming some of the lyrics. (The ones missing went onto become some of my favorite songs: Anything, Anything by Dramarama and I Want Your Hands On Me by Sinead O'Connor. Do you know how hard life is without the internet to look things up!?!?) I always love a good female combatant, but the nerdy-girl Alice (the very BEST Nightmare heroine, sorry, Nancy fans) turned warrior wasn't just awesome, but beautiful and a great challenge for the exciting climax/showdown in the church in the closing. In addition, since I was about the same age, give or take a couple of years, of most of the teens in this movie, I can safely say: they got how teens act and what they say down to a tee, much like any of the John Hughes movies. The death/nightmare scenes weren't just clever and topical (for the time) but they kept the story going, whether you were laughing or reminiscing in the moments. Freddy proved himself as the number one villain of all 1980s horror franchises. It's no wonder this was the top grossing of all the Nightmare films (if you don't count Freddy Vs. Jason.) I loved seeing Freddy at his best and especially his glove \u0096 many a scene they acted like his claws/knifes sprung like Wolverine's. I loved seeing him in different costumes and with as many one-liners as most comedies. On a personal note, as a critic (in my own mind-dammit) I generally will always try to be unbiased. Such as, a movie of this stature would be 4 to 4½ stars with all the (non-personal remembrance) positives I mentioned. But, for once, I am taking this to a personal level and how much this movie meant to me. To hell with the majority of critics, the audience and my own personal impartial views \u0096 even when the movie is dear to me. I am selfishly rewarding this the highest rating due to how much it means to me. See it anyways. It's fun horror. Something they rarely get right in today's time.",
         "Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight), Roland Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) and Joey Crusel (Rodney Eastman) are having normal lives and studying in Springwood, Ohio, after defeating the evil Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). Kristen is very close to her boyfriend Rick Johnson (Andras Jones) and his sister Alice (Lisa Wilcox) is her best friend. Kristen has a premonition with Freddy Krueger, who has resurrected and is chasing the trio of survivors of the Elm Street. When Freddy kills the three survivors, Kristen transfers her ability to draw other people to her dreams to Alice, and Freddy uses the power of the teenager to gather the souls of her school friends. \"A Nightmare on Elm Street art 4: The Dream Master\" is a weak sequel to the classic \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\". Patricia Arquette, who performed Kristen Parker in the previous \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\", was pregnant and not able to film this sequel. The actress and musician Tuesday Knight that replaced Patricia Arquette recorded the song \"Nightmare\" used during the film's opening credits. My vote is five. Title (Brazil): \"A Hora do Pesadelo 4 \u0096 O Mestre dos Sonhos\" (\"The Hour of the Nightmare 4 \u0096 The Master of the Dreams\")",
         "\"Nightmare on Elm Street 4\" is one of the best entries in the series. Okay, the first is considered a classic, maybe because it had a feeling of poetic surrealism that is indeed lost here. But, come on, it is the FOURTH Freddy film, did you REALLY expect it to be scary? Freddy delivers indeed too many puns, however some of them actually hit the mark. After all, the quality of a slasher film doesn't depend exclusively on how \"serious\" and \"vicious\" the killer is - he was more serious in \"Part 2\", which was an embarrassment, he was less serious in \"Part 3\", which was an imaginative, entertaining film. As for \"Part 4\", it has way-above-average acting, a polished look (just compare it to some early \"Friday The 13th\" cheapies) and some gruesome, stunning visual effects. Above all, the movie exploits more possibilities about the links between reality and dreams than the \"classic\" original did. It is worth seeing.",
         "A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Dream Master Director: Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight) ***out of**** Review Freddy is at the top of his game. After the immensely popular \"Dream Warriors\", Freddy had reached his peak of pop culture. This movie brashly illustrates the pop culture, with Freddy being less scary, and more of an icon. I admit once again of seeing all the horror franchises at a (very) young age and I don't think I was alone as by this point in the franchise as there was a wave of Freddy toys, sheets, lunch boxes, posters, etc. Basically the statistics were rolled in, and marketing knew its age group. So yes, before I start this review, I'll say that Freddy isn't scary, the movie doesn't even try to scare you, but alas, it wants to entertain, and boy does it ever. The movie continues on from 3, with the survivors trying to get on with their lives (Kristen, Joe, Kincaid) and the beginning has Kristen (now played by the less competent Tuesday Knight) having the dream at the Elm street house (which is EVEN more pimping then 3). She gets frightened and pulls the other two in, but they get angry and don't believe her (after everything they went through together you'd think they wouldn't give it a second thought, but never mind). We then go into the now familiar territory of the introduction of our new batch of teens since the Elm street children are near extinct. Alice is the only one we should really invest in since she eventually is going to take the lead as Freddie's new opponent. Anyways, Freddy indeed does resurrect (in one kick ass surreal \"regeneration\" scene which is started by flaming dog urine!?!) and continues to dispatch our reaming survivors. The mythology for this sequel indeed makes sense and tries to expand off 3. It seems if Freddy kills all the final Elm street children he will forever be trapped in the dream world with no more victims so he now must find someone he can use to bring new victims, and he finds that in the very shy and insecure Alice, who inherits Kristen's gift (after her grisly \"furnace\" death). One thing Freddy didn't count on is that every time he kills someone, she inherits their special power, and gets stronger and stronger, but when Freddy kills a very close family member, Alice must use everything she's got in a final kick ass showdown. Although many people feel this movie is a cheat and that the series should have ended after 3, I beg to differ and felt that the closure for 3 was to poorly done, making the ending very underwhelming, I WANTED MORE! So the sequel is a somewhat decent companion piece to 3. Bringing back the warriors was genius, and I enjoyed the continuity. Sure, I can make a stink about them getting killed, but personally since I cared so much about them from 3, their deaths upped the stakes for me. Also the new characters, although noting that layered, the actors portraying them were competent and very likable none the less, like three, I cared about the kids. Also Lisa Wilcox is a revelation, making the most interesting Elm Street character ever. I was rooting for her all the way. Another pro for this sequel is Renny Harlin in the directing seat. Not only did he create the most visually appealing sequel of the entire series, he made the movie and extremely effortless watch as well. This movie ahs flaws, but boring us is not one of the them. It's so fast paced, you feel like you need to stop for a breath of air. The camera is very fluid and I loved the style. The colors are also very vibrant, lot's of green and red lighting. Thank you Mr. Harlin, you certainly can punch a wallop with your scenes. As with 3, there is so much scenes that stand out in my mind with picture clarity, the Junkyard scene, the watered scene, the beach scene, the classroom scene, the elevator scene, the movie theater, Freddy eating the Pizza, Alice and Dan spinning through the tunnel, Roach motel scene, Freddy's death, all classic scenes and after watching them you can see why the movie made the most money in the entire series (ex Freddy Vs Jason). Some flaws I have with the movie are 1) Although the deaths had good SFX, the gore and mean streak so prominent in previous sequels was seriously lacking, Should have made Freddy mean like 3 did, 2) the movie's narrative gets a little shaky in places, making some dream sequences not following up with logic, comes off as a tad distracting, and 3) the movie does get a little heavy handed making some scenes very cheesy (you'll probably groan) like Alice gearing up to go into hand and hand combat. To much man, I ended up laughing at it. Overall though, this is the last decent hurrah for Freddy. The movie sells his soul but at least it's still quite fun watching it go down, swinging. It only gets lesser and lesser after this one, and Robert Englund has even admitted he felt strongly about this movie ending the series, as Freddy's death certainly makes sense and is a fitting touch. What a kick ass scene too. This is where Elm street ends for me, even though I still watch 5, I consider this to be Freddy's final \"adventure\". Of course, commercialism and the mighty buck thought otherwise, but you can still consider this the final Freddy, and should wisely do so.",
         "It gets as worse as it remains in next parts from these part, too much time for Freddy on the screen (with bad jokes), stupid killings and mindless plot. As always, Rennys style to shoot is quite childish and way too brutal. This is best of his directions I've seen but not quite convincing. There's much more 80's music and dancing scenes (like in Footloose and such 80's musical movies) than any other parts of A Nightmare on Elm Street series. The best part is when nearly every main character from previous movie was killed (because they were quite irritating). Also even the first part was kind of brutal (wich I liked) this one goes too far; its kind of childish. Also plot is quite stupid, Freddy has been buried 3 times before this and even still he terrorizes kids dreams. And his recovering story isn't even good or clever. There is also some lazy things like first deaths; earlier only way you could die in dreams and real life in same time was that Freddy killed you with certain way and then you don't for example burn in real life, your body is just burn but don't burn like you could see it in real life. Now those deaths and ways to die come to real life and also real life and dreams/nightmares mixes together. This movie is little bit unfinished.",
         "A funny thing happened to Freddy Krueger somewhere between the cross-cultural push for A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors and this fourth chapter: Our latex-faced pun factory somehow became a Pop culture icon. Posters, dolls, and even squirt guns hit store shelves, and the Elm Street franchise became more about marketing blitz than horror. Scary scenes gave way to scary amounts of merchandising money, and a character who once lurked in the shadows of our subconscious nightmares was soon just as at home as a blurry bit of pixelation on your NES console. Though memory is a bit fuzzy as to which Freddy products came out before, during, and after A Nightmare On Elm Street 4, the film was regardless the first in the series produced under the umbrella of Freddy as a viable mainstream property (looking back, it's actually quite amazing there was never an Elm Street Saturday morning cartoon). With more money in the production budget, and a clearer sense of who the core demographic for Freddy's nocturnal mayhem was, The Dream Master looks immediately different than any entry in the series up to that point. This film is Freddy as tailored for the MTV generation (there is even a commercial for the channel in the film... which repeats twice, no less). Somehow, the idea of a maniacal night-stalker being given a high-gloss makeover simply doesn't sound frightening, which would lead many to anticipate this film to be a new low in the already fading franchise. Shockingly, when you remove any expectations of watching a horror movie from this experience, Elm Street 4 actually ends up being one of the best outings in the series, loaded with enough unique ideas to fill several films, and enough special effects to fill a hundred. Tellingly, the opening credits list more FX personnel than actors, as the real star of this show is the visual effects. Our young cast embodies characters who are so one-dimensional that we only learn enough about them to set up their eventual demise (Rick does kung-fu and is killed in a dream dojo, Debbie hates cockroaches and meets her fate in the bizarro \"Roach Motel\" sequence, etc.). So, we've clearly shifted gears from a horror franchise to a series of fantasy-based films. But once you adjust to this change, it's hard not to be impressed by how fantastic the fantasy elements are. Freddy's blades are all but retired here, replaced by a new ability to insert our characters into a funhouse designed especially for their singular traits. But the film-makers weave such a rich and clever tapestry of dreamland dementia, it's nearly impossible not to get sucked into it with our doomed teens. The film, admittedly, also has weaknesses galore. Our previous heroine Kristen returns, but instead of the strong and multi-layered character essayed by Patricia Arquette in Dream Warriors, we get a neurotic and generally annoying turn by reliever Tuesday Knight. The MTV elements come to the forefront thanks to a loaded soundtrack (admission: I paid 39 dollars for a CD copy of it on eBay) that combines the awesome with the awful, so the film has aged poorly because of its dated tunes. (It's also worth noting that the producers were far too literal in their song selection: The film opens with a song with the chorus refrain \"running from this nightmare\" and closes with a number that repeats the mantra \"don't be afraid of your dreams\"). More disturbingly, Freddy's tendencies toward lame humor, only hinted at in previous outings, now dominate his character, and the cackling antagonist is unable to be on screen for 10 seconds without delivering a groaning zinger. But, dude, those effects! The smörgåsbord on display here runs like a textbook, and almost no area of special effects is left undiscovered by the film's end. The film-makers also enlisted several different teams to produce all of these wonders, so each nightmare sequence has a unique stamp that fits with the individualized nature of each death. Problematic? Yes. But this entry is far better in terms of simple entertainment than most give it credit for. Taken on its own, it holds up remarkably well, even if as part of a franchise that once generated genuine scares, it doesn't quite live up to expectations. We're removed from the media blitz now (at least until the \"re-imagining\" of the original Elm Street comes out), so it's a good time to take another look at an outing that sets a high bar for imagination and ingenuity that would never be matched again in a Nightmare film. Give it one more shot."
