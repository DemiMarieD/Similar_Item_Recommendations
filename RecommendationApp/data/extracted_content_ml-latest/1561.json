When Jasmine, Tanya and Micki decide they'd rather be divorced than unmarried, they take off to Las Vegas in search of the perfect ex. In the tangled web that follows, Micki lassos a cowboy, Tanya acquires a rich businessman, and Jasmine finds true love in the arms of a regular guy. The result is an outrageous comedy of love, marriage and misadventure.  As intelligent as it is absurd, Wedding Bell Blues pokes great fun at the twists and turns of modern love, with outstanding performances from a talented young cast, including Illeana Douglas, Paulina Porizkova and Julie Warner, it is without a doubt one of the year's most hilarious movies.",

         "Jasmine (Illeana Douglas), Tanya (Paulina Porizkova), and Micki (Julie Warner) are apartment mates. Micki is about to be married, Tanya discovers she is pregnant by her long-standing boyfriend and Jasmine has a endless queue of men in and out of her bedroom. When Micki is suddenly jilted and Tanya's boyfriend does not pop the question, the three women decide to head to Las Vegas in search of men who will marry them...TODAY! Some of the choices include cowboys, stiff engineers and rich uglies. It seems like a bad idea, but, hey, stranger things have happened, right? This is most likely a movie the male gender would deem a chick flick. The three ladies are all very beautiful and successful, so it's hard to imagine they are striking out in the love zone. However, Douglas, Warner, and Porizkova are total delights in their assigned roles. The lesser characters, including John Corbett, are also very well chosen. Las Vegas is a tinseltown of misspent dollars and does not offer much in the way of scenery. To make up for this, the costumes are lovely. Do you love movies that offer lots of smooching and giggles? Break out of the blues and locate this film before the week's end.",
         "Mildly satisfying flick about three roommates making a pathetic attempt to quickly \"catch up\" with their friends and family's expectations by finding a man and getting married the same day in Las Vegas. Debbie Reynolds' Vegas hotel and her nightclub act are featured. Everyone gets what they need, but not necessarily what they thought they wanted going into this.",
         "I think this movie is a must see for all single women. It is hilarious and will make people see that not everyone HAS to get married right away. Made me see how family can put a lot of pressure on someone to not be single."
