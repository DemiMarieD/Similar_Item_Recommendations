      "synopsis": "Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a history high school teacher living in the suburbs of Omaha, Nebraska whose enthusiastic involvement at school masks his frustration with other aspects of his life. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving senior with a secret vindictive and sexual side. Earlier in the year, Tracy had an affair with another teacher, McAllister's best friend Dave (Mark Harelik). As a result, Dave was fired and divorced by his wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll); Tracy walked away without any reprisal or punishment. One day, Tracy announces that she is running for student body president, which horrifies McAllister, who is in charge of organizing the school's student government and truly despises Tracy, aware of her ruthless ambition. Set to run unopposed, McAllister decides to teach Tracy a lesson in humility by introducing another candidate. Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) is a polite and popular football player at the school. Paul is unable to play football his final year due to recovering from a broken leg, leaving him depressed. McAllister convinces him to register for the election in order to stop Tracy's chances of winning, since McAllister thinks that if Tracy wins the election, she will have to spend more time with him which might lead to the same misfortune that his best friend had. At first, Paul does not like the idea because he does not feel smart enough to run in the election, and he does not want to go against Tracy, who has been nice to him, even letting him copy her homework. Eventually, Paul agrees with McAllister because the election gives him a new purpose. This only brings out more of Tracy's wicked vindictiveness, as she is jealous of Paul's ease at being successful and popular. Meanwhile, Paul's lesbian and rebellious younger sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) is dumped by her girlfriend, Lisa (Frankie Ingrassia), who says that she is heterosexual and was just \"experimenting\". Lisa does not waste time in \"getting over\" Tammy, performing oral sex on Paul after asking him to drive her home from school one day. The two become an item (Paul claiming that they would \"go to her house after school to fuck\" and swim in the hot tub) and election partners, in part to anger Tammy. In retaliation, Tammy decides to run for president as well, with a platform that student government is a sham. During a school assembly to hear their speeches, after Tracy draws only polite applause and Paul gets a strong reaction, Tammy delivers a defiant speech in which she denounces the election by saying that the school president does not really help the student body, and only uses the position to get credentials for college applications, much to Tracy's chagrin (she knows that Tammy's remark is more then a little true). Tammy also declares that she will dissolve the student government if elected. This rallies the student body to a standing ovation. Fearing the student body will vote for Tammy and thus the dissolution of the student government, Tammy is suspended and is disqualified from the election. While at school one night over the weekend, Tracy tries to fix one of her posters, but accidentally tears it. In a fit of uncharacteristic rage, she destroys all of Paul's campaign posters. She tries to dispose of them at the power plant, but is observed doing so by Tammy. The next day, when confronted by McAllister, the manipulative Tracy feigns innocence and threatens legal action against the school. A little later, Tracy sees Tammy talking to McAllister and showing him the torn posters, which makes Tracy panic. However, Tammy is actually \"confessing\" to Tracy's crime and is then transferred to a private parochial school for girls, which was the original objective of her false confession: to get away from the school and be sent away. Later, McAllister, who is secretly attracted to Linda, kisses her spontaneously the day before the election and they have sex. Linda asks Jim to rent a motel room for a later rendezvous and he leaves school during a class to prepare the room. However, when he arrives later to pick her up, she is not there. He returns home to find Linda and his wife (Molly Hagan) talking together. Knowing he has been caught, Jim leaves without saying a word and spends the night in his car outside Linda's house. The next morning, McAllister oversees the counting of the election ballots at school. During this, he calls Linda several times, professing his love for her, but she rejects him. After getting stung by a bee, Jim's wife kicks him out of the house when he tries to apologize to her over his infidelity. After all the ballots are counted, Tracy has won by only one vote (Paul voted for Tracy, feeling she was more qualified and that it is too arrogant to vote for oneself). After seeing Tracy dancing around excitedly in the hall, McAllister deduces that she found out that she won before it was announced. Aware that the thought of winning will go to Tracy's head, McAllister secretly disposes of two of Tracy's ballots and then demands a recount, naming Paul as the winner. While McAllister and Paul argue about the validity of vote, it is suggested that the tally of protest votes for Tammy (disqualified on the ballot) exceeded that of either other candidate. But the very next day, the school janitor (whom holds an irrational grudge against McAllister) discovers the two discarded ballots in a wastebasket that McAllister unwisely left behind and immediately presents them to the principal. Upon arrival for work, McAllister is confronted by everyone that he tried to fix the election. Having been caught yet again, the bad-luck prone McAllister admits to trying to rig the vote to keep Tracy from winning and immediately afterwords resigns from his job. Divorced and humiliated in having lost everything (job, career, marriage, reputation, friends, etc) in his half-baked schemes to thwart Tracy's evil schemes, McAllister leaves Nebraska forever. Everyone he used to know disavows knowing him and everything bearing his name is removed from the school and the neighborhood. All of his neighbors, friends, students, and co-workers turn their backs on him and to this day talk as if he never existed. McAllister decides to start over with his life when he ultimately chooses to fulfill a longtime dream of moving to New York City. He settles in Manhattan and takes another job of being a tour guide at the American Museum of Natural History. McAllister later meets a new woman and sets about to rebuild his life. McAllister's friend Dave is revealed to have moved to Iowa after his divorce and took a low-paying job of stocking shelves at a local supermarket. His wife, Lisa, remains in Nebraska with their young daughter and apparently never re-marred or ever saw her ex-husband Dave or Jim McAllister again. McAllister's wife is said to have sold their house soon after their divorce and also moved away from Nebraska. She legally changed her name and her current whereabouts are unknown. Having won the election, Tracy fulfills her duties as student body president like a hard-line dictator, keeping all of the students under a tight leach. She later graduates from the school with full honors as valedictorian. She gets accepted into Georgetown University in Washington DC with a full four-year scholarship. Despite having gotten everything she ever wanted (exactly as McAllister predicted by lying, manipulating, seducing, intimidating, pushing and shoving, etc.) she still does not fit in with other students and has no friends... much to her disappointment. Four years later, as Tracy graduates from Georgetown U at the very top of her class with a full degree and the desire to go into politics, she sadly comes to accept the fact that it is indeed lonely being at the top of everything. Following graduation, Paul gets into the University of Nebraska with his own four-year athletic scholarship and makes new friends by joining a popular fraternity and joining the college football team and he is now playing football again. He graduates from college and is said to now be playing pro-football for the St. Louis Rams. The misanthropic Tammy loves her new all-girls school, where she has met her new girlfriend. After graduation, Tammy ran away with her girlfriend and their current whereabouts are unknown. As the film closes, Jim McAllister recounts one final encounter he had with Tracy. During an excursion to Washington DC about seven years after his dismissal from Nebraska, McAllister sees Tracy from a distance climbing into a limousine with a local DC politician. McAllister is reminded of his friend Dave and what evil and sordid things Tracy has done to get where she is today. On the spur of the moment, he angrily hurls a soda cup at the limousine then makes a quick getaway. The final scene shows Jim McAllister back in New York asking questions to some young school children he is giving a tour to at the Museum, all the while deliberately ignoring an overeager little blond girl... the only one of the group who could answer as she strongly reminds him of a younger Tracy, thus implying that McAllister still does (and forever will) hold a grudge against the ruthless overachiever Tracy Flick.",

         "This is quite simply one of the finest movies I have ever seen. It has incredible pace and flair, with both the script and the direction demanding equal attention. And it just works so well on so many levels. Whilst it is a political satire, it also stands well as a story in its own right. It's great to see Matthew Broderick in a good film. Reese Witherspoone turns in what I consider to be a career-best, and Chris Klein is wonderfully endearing as a jock with a heart of gold. What I really love about Election is the way its pace doesn't let up at all. By the time you've finished you feel like you've seen a good two and a half hours of movie. It's the only film I know that seems longer than it is in a good way. This film made me laugh out loud more than any other I can remember that isn't just a dumb comedy. But Election also doesn't take itself too seriously. The direction can accurately be described as deadpan - with Chris Klein, stripped of his ability to play football, gazing soulfully out to sea, and falling asleep over a book on philosophy. The way that each major character is afforded a voice-over, giving us an amusing insight into their psyche, is a wonderful technique, and the freezeframes of Reese Witherspoone's contorted facial expressions truly are moments to treasure. What more can I say? Election is smart, funny, and biting. It maintains its brilliance for the entire duration of the movie, and the ending is wholly satisfying. In fact, I can't actually think of one word of criticism. You'll have to search long and hard to find a better film anywhere, which is why I'm giving it a stellar nine out of ten.",
         "The Academy Award attention heaped on \"Sideways\" helped to make Alexander Payne a mainstream name among casual film goers, but many of us knew about his talent as a film maker long before. And his two more recent films--\"Sideways\" and \"About Schmidt\"--have been much gentler (thought still terrific) than his earlier efforts. Before \"Election,\" Payne had already made \"Citizen Ruth,\" a caustic, bracing satire of the abortion issue, and \"Election\" continued his penchant for harsh, uncomfortable comedy. I mean that in a good way, though. Payne's movies are funny, but they make you uneasy for laughing at them, and they have sharp, intelligent insights into the attitudes that drive American values. In \"Election,\" Payne uses a high school class presidential election as an opportunity to lampoon everything that's goofy about the American political system. Just as in our national elections for president, the winner is not necessarily the person with the most integrity, and honesty is a liability, not a virtue. The person who is willing to play dirtiest comes out on top, and elections aren't about who is most qualified but rather about who is most popular. And, the best part about the movie is its acknowledgement of voter apathy. Most Americans don't really give a damn, something that makes them not so different from the majority of high schoolers who don't even understand the point of having a class president to begin with. In fact, in the film's best scene, the assembly at which each candidate gives her/his campaign speech, one of the candidates (who joins the race out of spite) gets the best reception from the crowd when she encourages everyone not to vote at all. Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance as Tracy Flick, the school's most likely to succeed, whose goodie-goodie exterior hides the fact that she's willing to do just about anything to get ahead. Matthew Broderick is refreshingly unlikable as a social studies teacher who would like to see Tracy fail just once, until the fact that his own life is falling apart turns this wish into an obsession. And Chris Klein has some fun as the dopey, Jesus-following popular guy who becomes Tracy's arch rival, but never really even knows it. Payne doesn't tidy up his film's moral messages. On the one hand, Tracy is obnoxious, and we want to see her fail as much as Broderick's character does. But she does know how to play the game, and isn't that part of what makes someone a good leader? We sympathize with Broderick up to a point, but his motives really are driven by a personal vendetta, not by any altruistic ideal of right vs. wrong. So if you normally need someone to root for in order to enjoy a movie, you're probably not going to like this one. But who expects a hero?...I mean, come on, we're talking about American politics here. Grade: A",
         "Ethics and Morals I'm not generally a fan of excessive voice-over and quirky, stylised direction but here it's all done so well. It seems to suffer from that classic \"this film didn't make sense\" style of review, but it clearly does. A wonderful script with a great mix of slapstick and intelligent comedy and winning performances from Broderick, a brilliant Reese Witherspoon and the normally hapless Chris Klein. And, yes, it has sex in it. It's hardly titillating and is always completely relevant to the plot. But if you simply hate seeing sex (not nudity, of which there is very little) in films then you won't like it. It beats Rushmore to the 'best film set in a high school' award.",
         "With me, Alexander Payne can do no wrong. Before he entered Hollywood's big league of directors with ABOUT SCHMIDT and SIDEWAYS, he made this remarkable film about a highschool election. But this is hardly your average highschool flick, this is an intelligently written, foul-mouthed film, filled with colorful characters and plenty of laughs in the process. In a pitch-perfect role, Reese Witherspoon is Tracy Flick, one of those irritating girls that are always in the front row, always raise their hand and wanna do something for the sake of the school, read, for their own resume. Tracy Flick is one of those, a fiercely calculating careerist who will stop at nothing to get the main prize, the office of student body president at Carver High. Since she's running unopposed, nothing seems in her way at getting what she wants, again. History teacher and student government adviser Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick, Ferris Bueller reversed) seems content with his life, but is worn out by his love-less marriage, and by the plight of his best friend and colleague, sacked for sleeping with consenting but under age Tracy Flick. With the coming elections, McAllister is appalled by the prospect of working closely with this little nagging career bitch, and charged with overseeing the proceedings, discreetly sponsors a rival candidate, dumb but popular jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), to enter the election. But when Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), an embittered and unpopular girl announces her candidacy, the election becomes a really back-biting and nasty affair, with Jim McAllister getting more than he bargained for. I think this film might appeal even more to adults than teenagers. If you like Alexander Payne's uncompromising approach to his subjects, this will definitely be up your alley, with everything from lesbianism to adultery thrown in the mix. Ideally casted all the way, with Matthew Broderick, after a number of uninteresting roles in lame movies, really making his mark. He gives his role a sort of understatement that makes Mr. McAllister a hopelessly tragic, but utterly lovable loser. Camera Obscura --- 9/10",
         "A unique microcosm of politics in the U.S. is shown in \"Election\", one of the most interesting productions of 1999. Set in a high school, young over-achiever Reese Witherspoon feels that she should be the next student council president. Teacher Matthew Broderick feels that Witherspoon is an evil and manipulative person who just thinks about herself and her own status. Enter dumb jock Chris Klein, who does have a good heart and a fair amount of popularity. Broderick talks him into running and the madness begins. Add Klein's lesbian sister, Broderick's torrid affair and ballot tampering and you have a film that shows its intelligence and shows the lengths that people will go to further their own lives at the expense of others. Neat and smart little satire. Some parts seem to be foreshadowers to the awful presidential election of 2000 between Al Gore and George W. Bush. 4 stars out of 5.",
         "Election is easily my favorite comedy and one of my top ten favorite movies of all time. It brings out the best in most of it's cast and the stylistic quality of the film is both outrageous and subtle at the same time. However, the most amazing part of Election is that it makes an incredible movie and bases it around a subject so simple as a high school election. But do not be fooled by it's simplicity in basic plot because hiding behind it's summary is a film that truly was underappreciated and very underrated. MTV has never and will never again get a movie as stunning as this. Reese Witherspoon gives the performance of her career by playing Tracy Flick, a neurotic, self-obsessed go getter with a somewhat dark past that puts her on edge with Jim McCalister, a teacher who truly will stop at nothing to bring her down. I will not say any more about Election except that those who have not seen this movie are truly missing out on an amazing film",
         "High-school comedies became popular because the milieu was familiar to a large proportion of the film-going audience\u0085 But the best examples of the genre in the 1980s and 1990s satirized not only the constant battle of the sexes, but other elements in American life\u0085 The frequent struggles between jocks and nerds were a kind of microcosm of the class difference which is supposed not to exist in the United States\u0085 In \"Election,\" one of the best examples of this popular genre, much of the humor is at the expense of the 'democratic' process\u0085 The film's guiding insight is that in practice democracy reduces to a popularity contest, in which dirty tricks are the norm\u0085 Tracy is a Nebraskan high-school blonde who is brilliant and hard-working\u0085 She is standing for election as student president\u0085 Played by Reese Witherspoon, Tracy is bright and intolerant, eaten up by ambition and her ruthless determination to win\u0085 She is regarded with disgust by a career teacher and student adviser, Jim McAllister, for her self-righteousness, and also for her role in the dismissal of his fellow teacher Dave after a sex scandal\u0085 Jim encourages student football star Paul to stand against Tracy\u0085",
         "\"Election\" is a dark comedy - dark and funny. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an over-achiever and creates havoc in the life of her teacher (Matthew Broderick) as the school elections approach. I have to echo the sentiment that this is one of the best (if not the best) movie set in a high school. It's hard to even call it a high school movie as the topics encompass a broader range, and it's a very intelligent and thoughtful script. It's dramatic with its dark situations, and at the same time it's a very smart comedy. Starring a young Reese Witherspoon who proves her bright future and Matthew Broderick who is perfect in the role and floats effortlessly between drama and comedy. A well deserved Oscar nomination for Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor for the screenplay. Their other movies include \"About Schmidt\" (2002) and \"Sideways\" (2004). \"Election\" is one of the best films of its kind. I recommend it.",
         "For some reason, this film has always brought a laugh to the bottom of stomach. Some people may call it boring due to the fact its not some gross-out teen comedy, but this is really the antithesis of a great satire. One can't see the scaly nature of politics simply because its always drowned in newspeak and bad reporting. But to see it at this level of understanding, it proves to be quite entertaining. It also provides a precursor to our most recent (2000) election. We have the longtime politician, the incompetent who people like, and the iconoclast who wants to shake up government. And of course, there is the cheating regulator who gets the wrong person elected for his own slimy means. Who would have guessed life would imitate art. A great film for all to see. Matthew Broderick is at his best, Reese Witherspoon really sells her role, and I actually tolerated Chris Klein's role in this film.",
         "James McAllister is a contented high school teacher who is presiding over the elections for school president this year. However, the only student running for the position is the overly keen Tracey Flick \u0096 a driven student who he feels is callous and blames for his best friend being fired for falling in love with her. Desperate to prevent her becoming president, James convinces injured jock Paul to run, prompting Paul's love-scorned sister to also stand. Where once the presidency was a good clean-cut race, Tracey takes the competition badly, and it descends into something a lot more sinister. I wasn't totally sure about this film but I had heard good things about it and, even though the fact that it was an MTV Production put me off a bit, I decided to give it a try. The film is quite clever for the most part and takes the worn genre and clichés of high school movies and makes them into a quite good little political satire of sorts \u0096 albeit one that is rather downbeat at times. The comedy is not laugh out loud funny and maybe that's a problem, but I enjoyed the parallels with modern politics (and sexual issues) and found it to make some good points in a funny way. Of course the end is rather downbeat but only because it is sadly believable. I must say that I was rather put off by a couple of different things. The first was the amount of sexual material in the film \u0096 not a real problem but I was a little put off by how graphically the subject of underage sex was dealt with. This was a minor problem (if you can pardon the pun!) but what I found a little worrying was Payne's apparent misogynistic touch on the film \u0096 all the men were hapless saps and the women held the real power all the way; I'm not saying this is not true but Payne has little sympathy for his female characters and they may come off better overall but there is no love lost for them. The cast opens with an amusing bit of role reversal that sees everyone's favourite high school student become a teacher in the shape of Matthew Broderick. Hardly having the best run of roles for a while, he is actually pretty good here even if some of what happens to his character doesn't seem to fit very well. Witherspoon is annoying but the difference here is that it is intentional! She easily fits into the character and her role has a great touch to it \u0096 I'm not saying it is easy to enjoy her performance but she is good. Klein does his usual dumb jock thing but is fortunate that he has the material to support (this time) but I felt Campbell was left with a sympathetic character that was placed on the sidelines too much. Overall I enjoyed this film but it had its limitations. It isn't hilariously funny as many coming to this genre may expect but it is quite cleverly written. The story struggles a bit as it goes along, with threads left hanging that stop it being as tight as it maybe could have been but generally I enjoyed it but can see why some others have problems with it."

         "Tracy Flick is running unopposed for this year's high school student election. But school civics teacher Jim McAllister has a different plan. Partly to establish a more democratic election, and partly to satisfy some deep personal anger toward Tracy, Jim talks popular varsity football player Paul Metzler to run for president as well. Chaos ensues.",
         "Jim McAllister is a Social Studies teacher at Carver High. A student of his, Tracy Flick, tends to rub him the wrong way.

His lesbian sister Tammy joins the election after her girlfriend starts going out with Paul. During the campaigns, Tracy plays dirty, plying students with muffins and gum. Tammy adopts an anarchist attitude that the student body responds to. Paul has few skills to offer the position. Meanwhile, McAllister's going through a bad time with his wife.",
