         "content": "Intense classic showcasing many wonderful artists.\r\n\r\nFrank McCloud is in the Florida Keys to visit the widow and father in law of an old war buddy, whilst at the hotel they run, he finds it has been taken over by gangster Johnny Rocco and his thugs.\r\n\r\nThe cast, the performances, the screenplay, tight direction, the photography and on it goes to give us a bona fide entry into 1940s classics. It never ceases to amaze me how well Key Largo stands up on repeat viewings, each viewing bring something new to my ever keen eye. This latest viewing bringing me abundant joy in observing the background acting of the supporting players, not one of them looking on waiting for the director to shout CUT, each adding greatly with intense facial mannerisms, check out some of the background stuff Thomas Gomez does for example. Ah intense, what a truly befitting word to use as regards John Huston's direction here, perfectly capturing the stifling heat of Largo and coupling it with the sweltering tension inside this run down hotel.\r\n\r\nKey Largo is often thought of as the lesser film from the Bogart/Bacall production line, which in fairness is against some pretty special opposition, maybe we do lose the sexual chemistry of the mighty duo here, but in its place is a mano-mano face off teetering on the brink of explosion, Edward G Robinson's weasel Rocco in danger of becoming a loose cannon to McCloud's staid drifter, the atmosphere is palpable as this room full of hate and mistrust starts bubbling to boiling point.\r\n\r\nHumphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actress), Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis are all excellent, all benefiting from master director Huston molding them together, whilst Karl Freund's deep focus photography perfectly encapsulates the mood of the piece. I just love Key Largo so much, from a heart tugging singing for your drink scene, to a retreating in the shadows shot of Bacall, Key Largo is one of the reasons I became a cinema obsessive. 9/10",

      "synopsis": "The film opens with an aerial scene of the Florida Keys in the 1940s. Scrolling text says: At the southernmost point of the United States are the Florida Keys, a string of small islands held together by a concrete causeway. Largest of these remote coral islands is Key Largo. A bus is crossing a bridge and is overtaken by a sheriff's car, which pulls the bus over. Sheriff Ben Wade (Monte Blue) speaks to the driver through the window while Deputy Clyde Sawyer (John Rodney) walks through the bus. Sheriff Wade advises the driver they are looking for a couple of Indians that broke out of jail and describes them as young bucks in fancy shirts. He asks the driver to phone his office if he sees them. After the police leave, the driver turns and tells Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) seated behind him that the Indians must be from around here, as they always return home. \"Home being Key Largo\", says McCloud. The bus resumes its trip and pulls up at the Largo Hotel. A sign indicates \"Largo Hotel - James Temple, Proprietor\". McCloud departs the bus and walks into the hotel. A man (Harry Lewis) is reading the paper in the lobby, but no one else is around. Frank rings the bell at the front desk. The man reading the paper asks Frank if he wants something and Frank asks for Mr. Temple. The paper-reader tells him he isn't here, the hotel is closed, and he doesnt know when Mr. Temple will be back. Frank wanders into the adjacent bar to find a woman and several men listening to a radio. Frank asks for a beer and is told by the people at the bar, and again by the paper-reader who followed him in, that the hotel is closed in the summer, everything is closed. The woman, however, insists that the man standing behind the bar give Frank a drink, which he reluctantly does. Frank thanks the woman and sits down next to her, where he sees she is clearly intoxicated. She is glued to the radio and listening to a horse race, following along on a racing form. The buzzer behind the bar goes off and a man at the bar says \"that's him\", whereupon the man behind the bar pours a drink and hands it to paper-reader. The woman says she'll bring it up, but the man seated at the bar says \"when he wants you he'll send for you\". The woman engages Frank in speculation about the next race and tells the man behind the bar, who we now know as Angel (Dan Seymour), to give Frank another drink. Frank lights a cigarette as the drunk woman rambles on about her handicapping strategy. She asks Frank his name and he tells her, along with his breeding lineage. She introduces herself as Dawn. Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor). Meanwhile, paper-reader returns from upstairs and tells Gaye \"he wants you\". She excuses herself and stumbles through the lobby, making up her face as she goes. The men at the bar ask who Frank is, and tell him once again that the hotel is closed and wont be open for another month. Frank asks them what they're doing here, and they say they are here by special arrangement. Frank says he is not interested in staying, he just wants to see Mr. Temple. One of the men at the bar tells him hes out at the boathouse. Frank picks up his hat and bag and heads out. Out on the pier behind the hotel he meets James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), who is wheelchair-bound. When Frank introduces himself, Mr. Temple yells for his daughter Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall), who is tying up a small boat at the pier. Mr. Temple introduces Nora as George's wife and Frank tells her that he and her husband were in the same outfit overseas. The three make small talk about life in the Keys and Frank tells them he knows a lot about the Keys from conversations with George. Frank tells them he is just passing through on his way to Key West, but at Mr. Temple's insistence, agrees to stay the night in George's old room. As Nora heads back inside, she passes Sheriff Wade and Deputy Sawyer, who have just arrived. The police ask Mr. Temple if hes seen the Osceola brothers. He tells them no, and introduces Frank as his son's Commanding Officer. Deputy Sawyer tells Mr. Temple they want to look around for the Osceola brothers, and Mr. Temple tells them they are not there and suggests he look for them in the mangroves or in the water, or wait for them to give themselves up. Deputy Sawyer insists, but Sheriff Wade tells him that Mr. Temple's word is good enough for him, and the policemen depart. Mr. Temple tells Frank that the two Indian brothers grew up with his son George and were good people who did nothing more than get drunk and stir up some trouble in Palm Grove. He says that he's sent word for them to give themselves up - \"not that I know where they are, mind you\". Temple and Frank head back inside, where Temple formally introduces paper-reader to Frank as Edward Bass, and the man behind the bar as Angel Garcia. Temple tells the men that Frank was his son's Commanding Officer in the Italian campaign and that George was killed in the Italian campaign. Suddenly there is a disturbance from upstairs, Gaye screams, and the third man from the bar is seen shoving Gaye into a room. Frank asks why he hit her and he tells Frank shes a lush and that a sock in the kisser is the only thing that will bring her out of it. Nora tells Frank his room is ready and takes him there. Alone with Nora, Frank asks her about the guests, and Nora tells him the one they just saw, Richard \"Curly\" Hoff (Thomas Gomez) and Gaye got there first about a week ago. The Temples told them they were closed, but were offered so much money for a week they could not turn it down. Mr. Brown and the others arrived in a big boat four days ago. Frank asks which one is Brown, and Nora tells him he's in room 11 but only comes out at night, and he must be rich because the others jump at his command. Frank thinks it's odd that they chose to set down in Key Largo in this time of year with the extreme heat. Nora says they'll be leaving in a day or two so she doesnt care. Nora asks Frank if he was with George when he died and Frank tells her yes, but George did not suffer and never knew what hit him. Nora leaves Frank, and Curly stops in to introduce himself and apologizes for the brusque treatment in the bar. He explains they are here on a fishing trip from Milwaukee, a trip they planned for a year, and one guy screwed up the whole trip by bringing a lush woman with him. He says the woman spoiled the whole trip. Frank mostly ignores him coming down the stairs, apparently not happy about his treatment of Gaye in the upstairs hall. Curly offers him a drink, but Frank declines. Meanwhile, Nora takes a call and finds that a hurricane is on its way. She leads Frank to Mr. Temple's room. Temple and Nora ask Frank about George, as all they had was a letter from the War Department. Frank tells the Temples that George was a born-hero and tells them a few stories about George's heroism in Italy. He tells them that George talked incessantly about the Temples, including telling Frank some personal stories about Nora and his father that Frank relates to them. James asks where George is buried and Frank describes it. The Temples express their gratitude to Frank, who takes his leave. With the storm coming, Frank and Nora head out to secure some boats, and Nora asks what brought Frank to the islands. Frank says he is thinking of maybe settling down and making a living there. As they approach the boats, Curly shows up and introduces Frank to another member of their party, Ralph Feeney (William Haade). Frank and Nora secure a boat to the pier. Nora asks where Frank learned about boats and Frank tells her his first sweetheart was a boat. Curly asks Frank what he thinks about a large boat just offshore and Frank tells him its a nice boat, but should be secured away from the reef with the storm coming. Nora watches Frank with admiration as he ties up the Temples' boat. As they finish up, an Indian family arrives in several small boats, including a very old woman (Felipa Gomez). Nora explains that the Indians often stay with them when theres a storm. The last two Indians off the boat are Tom Osceola (Jay Silverheels) and John Osceola (Rodd Redwing) the Indians the sheriff is looking for. The Osceolas tell Nora they are here to give themselves up to the police, if thats what Mr. Temple thinks is right. Nora tells them to go inside and her Dad will call up to Palm Grove. Nora and Frank make small talk about how she met George. Meanwhile, the wind starts to blow and it begins to storm. Nora heads inside to start preparing for the storm as the fishing party mills about in the lobby and bar. Once again Curly tries to get Frank to drink with him. Ralph is obviously concerned about the hurricane, but Curly makes light of it and mocks Ralph. Mr. Temple comes into the lobby escorted by the Osceola brothers. He asks if anyone has seen Sheriff Wade, as his car is outside. Mr. Temple tells the Osceolas that maybe THEY should go looking for the Sheriff instead. Ed Bass, who Curly calls \"Toots\", reads the paper and tells silly jokes from the paper. Mr. Temple asks Frank, who is securing some doors, if he has seen the police, and Curly once again tries to get everyone to have a drink. The Temples and Frank once again decline. As Nora continues to prepare, Curly tells Ralph to go put up the windows in the car, but Ralph, obviously even more concerned, says \"no way\". The phone rings and Curly tells no one to answer it. He answers it himself and tells the caller that Mr. Temple is not here, and neither is Nora. Mr. Temple and Nora approach and Curly tells the caller that if Sawyer shows up he'll have him call right back. Nora tries for the phone, Curly snatches it away, and when Frank moves on Curly, both Curly and Toots pull guns on him. The scene switches to a man in a bathtub (Edward G. Robinson), reading a paper, smoking a cigar and having a drink. He gets out of the tub as Curly enters his room and tells him that the soldier tried to get rough with them, and they had to show him their guns. The man puts on a robe as Curly tells him it was the law on the phone looking for Sawyer. We then see that Sawyer, who has apparently chosen to ignore Sheriff Wade's direction to not snoop around, is in the bather's room, bleeding from the head, and we now realize that the call was apparently Sheriff Wade looking for him. Mr. Temple calls for Brown, the man in the tub, and with the whole gang in the lobby, verbally accosts them and ridicules them. He asks if they are thieves here to rob him, to which Toots replies \"thats right, we're here to steal all your towels\". Brown tells them that he doesnt want any trouble for anyone and asks Temple to act sensible; he'll be gone in a couple hours. He tells Temple that they will be HIS guest for a little while. Meanwhile, Sawyer begins to come around and walks out of Brown's room into the lobby, to the surprise of Temple and Nora. He says \"you wont get away with this, Rocco\" and is tripped and sent sprawling by Toots. Realization dawns on Frank's face as Temple asks why they hurt Sawyer (\"because hes a cop\"), and Frank suddenly recognizes Mr. Brown as Johnny Rocco. Frank tells Mr. Temple that Johnny Rocco is a notorious gangster. Temple says they threw Rocco out of the country. Temple then tells Rocco he should have been exterminated not deported, and Frank intervenes on Temple's behalf and flatters Rocco for his success in everything from running numbers to booze, as he built his criminal empire. Rocco, flattered, ignores Temple. Temple, however, continues to verbally assault Rocco as Frank continues to try and shield the Temples from Rocco. Rocco questions Frank about his war service and Frank downplays his role and says he was no hero and that he only did what he had to do in the war. Meanwhile, Rocco and Temple trade verbal assaults. Rocco taunts Temple until he rises from his chair and collapses trying to hit him. Nora tries to attack Rocco, scratching his face, but Rocco pins her arms behind her and kisses her instead. Ralph then arrives and tells Rocco that Miami wants him on the phone. Rocco departs and Frank and Nora help Temple back to his chair. Ralph tells Rocco a bunch of Indians want in from the storm and Rocco tells Ralph not to let them in. Rocco takes the call, from a man named \"Ziggy\". There is a knock on the door and Ralph answers it. It's the skipper of the boat he arrived in (Alberto Morin) and Ralph lets him in, but pushes the waiting Indians back outside. Meanwhile, Rocco is just hearing about the hurricane on the phone, but tells Ziggy \"it's got to be tonight\" and he'd see him in a couple hours. The Skipper tells Rocco that the boat must leave now, the storm is too dangerous. Rocco threatens him with a gun and the Skipper acquiesces and tells him OK. Meanwhile, Sawyer is telling the group that he came back looking for the Osceola boys. He says he ran into Toots and Curly in the lobby, grew suspicious, and put in a call to Sheriff Wade, but the lines went out before the call went through, and the next thing he remembers, he awoke in Rocco's room where he was promptly knocked out again. Rocco re-enters and tells the gang that everything is OK in Miami, and that the folks in Miami are leaving right away. He tells Sawyer that he's surprised that he EVER woke up after the way Toots worked him over. He sits down to have Angel give him a shave as he continues to taunt Sawyer about not being able to take him down. Rocco tells him he was too much for the big city and federal cops, and no hick cop like him will take him down. Rocco tells stories of how he once controlled politicians and cops alike. He rises from his shave, sees Nora in the mirror and tells how he once knew a \"wildcat like her\" named Maggie Mooney, but he had to change her name for professional reasons and that she was now Gaye Dawn. Rocco then approaches Nora and whispers in her ear. Nora is obviously revolted, but Rocco follows her as she walks away and whispers to her again. She turns to confront him and Temple tries to rise from his chair but is restrained by Toots. Rocco spins Nora around to face him and she spits in his face. Frank comes and leads Rocco away as Temple taunts him further. Frank tells Rocco to come on over, he'd like to spit on him too. Rocco, his rage building, tells Curly to give him a gun, which he does. The gang tells Rocco to smack Nora, but Frank tells the gang that spanking isnt good enough for Rocco, he wants to kill her, but if he killed her he'd have to kill all the witnesses too, including the gang. But he needs the gang, so he wont kill anyone just yet. Rocco is upset that Frank sees through him. Curly commends Frank for defusing the situation. Meanwhile, Gaye returns and wants to know what's going on and wants to start drinking again. It appears that she's missed the past several hours as she doesnt know whats going on. She is growing agitated from not having a drink, but Angel tells her the boss said no more. She gets upset and begins to curse Rocco, but just then, he re-enters the room, having dressed. Gaye sees the scratch on his face from Nora, and suddenly realizes what she missed. Rocco confronts Frank and asks him if he has a million dollars. When Frank says no, Rocco asks him why not, he thought he was a wise guy, and Frank says its because he was educated in the practical things, unlike Rocco who was just the opposite. Suddenly the wind blows a window open. Rocco wonders aloud if a car can get through the storm, and Gaye tries once again for a drink. Rocco and Frank continue to feel each other out. Frank tells Rocco that all he wants is more, more, more and that all he wants, himself, is a world where there is no place for the Johnny Roccos. Rocco offers to give him his chance and hands Frank a gun while pulling one of his own. He tells Frank here's his chance to get his wish, but he's got to die for it, as Rocco is aiming at his belly. He taunts Frank to shoot him as Temple tells him to kill him. Rocco taunts and taunts, and Frank is egged on by Sawyer as well. Rocco tells Frank he must not want it enough, and Frank throws the gun down, saying \"one Rocco, more or less, isnt worth dying for.\" Temple says to give HIM the gun, and Rocco says no, he's afraid he'd use it and one old man, more or less, isnt worth dying for. Rocco insinuates that Frank is a coward and that's how he survived the war. Suddenly, Sawyer springs to his feet and grabs the gun Frank discarded and levels it at Rocco. He backs toward the door and tells Rocco he can stop him, but HE'S got to die first. He tells Toots and Angel to get out of his way and continues toward the door, holding the gun on Rocco. As Sawyer gets to the door and opens it, Rocco shoots him. Sawyer shoots back, only to find that the gun he has, the one that Rocco gave to Frank, is not loaded. Rocco shoots him again and he falls out of the doorway. Rocco tells Nora that yes, the gun wasn't loaded, but \"our hero didn't know it\". Temple says Frank knew the gun wasn't loaded, Frank said he did not, Toots said Frank was just a coward, but Gaye gets it right and says that Frank was smart, because he knew what happened to Sawyer would have happened to him and \"it's better to be a live coward than a dead hero\". Curly and Angel take Sawyer's body out in a boat to dump it at sea, while Ralph cleans up the mess where Sawyer fell dead. The phone rings and Rocco answers it. It's Ziggy, and Rocco is upset because Ziggy is not there yet. He says he risked his neck to come from Cuba with \"the shipment\" and he knows a dozen guys who will take it if Ziggy isnt there by ten o'clock, two hours from now. The power then goes out in the hotel and Toots herds everyone downstairs at gunpoint. Gaye makes her way to the bar and pours a drink, but Rocco tells her he told her no drinking. Angel and Curly return from disposing of Sawyer and Rocco tells them to go get the shipment. Rocco pours out Gaye's drink and tells the whole crew, now assembled in the bar, how she's an alcoholic and if there's one thing he can't stand its a dame that's a lush. She wasn't like that eight years ago. She tells him he hasn't changed and is still as mean as can be. Rocco says that reminds him of a song she used to sing, and humiliates her about how she could have been a star. He tells her if she sings her old song he will let her have a drink. Gaye tells the group about her days as a singer and starts singing Billie Holiday's song \"Moanin' Low\". She sings very poorly and humiliates herself even further, to the bemusement of Rocco. When she finishes, she runs to the bar for her drink, but Rocco denies her anyway. Frank then goes behind the bar, pours a scotch and gives it to Gaye who slams it down. Rocco slaps Frank three times in the face. Frank ignores Rocco and tells Gaye she's welcome. As Toots and Curly sit down to play gin and wait, the hurricane gets worse and the building starts shaking. Rocco asks Temple \"how bad can it get?\", and Temple tells Rocco of the hurricane of 1935 that had 200mph wind and killed 800 people. Nora apologizes, quietly, to Frank for calling him a coward and he tells her he's not a hero. But she tells him that she knows otherwise, and she knows from George's letters that Frank was really the hero that Frank told her George was. With the storm worsening, Rocco begins to get more and more worried and nervous. The hotel creaks and shakes and Frank smiles as he senses Rocco's fear. Rocco tells Temple he's a liar, that the story of the 1935 hurricane never happened. Temple plays on his fear and tells him how the storm was so strong it blew a train off the tracks. Frank taunts Rocco and asks him why he doesn't just show the storm his gun and threaten to shoot IT. Temple prays for a wave to kill them all. Rocco pulls his gun on Temple, but Frank intervenes as Rocco puts the gun in Frank's belly and pulls the trigger, but Rocco apparently has the unloaded gun now. The tension is broken as a tree comes crashing through a window. The scene switches to outside and we see waves crashing over the island and the Indians huddling on the hotel's porch begging to be let in. Back inside the hotel, some time has passed and the storm is abating. Frank tells Nora pretty soon nothing will be left but some trash on the beach. Nora asks if she'll ever see Frank again, and Temple tells Frank he'd be honored if he came down, as he considers him family. It is then that Toots comes into the lobby yelling for the boss to tell him that the boat is gone. The skipper has apparently taken off without Rocco and the gang, who are now stranded in Key Largo. Rocco says not to worry, there is another boat out there and that Frank will run it for them. The Osceola brothers appear at the door, yelling at Mr. Temple for denying their family shelter from the storm. Rocco had told Temple he sent them away. Temple tells Rocco they could have died out there, but Rocco does not care. He turns to Frank and tells him that he will be taking them to Cuba. Frank says he will not, and Rocco will not kill him because hes the only way off the island. Rocco then threatens him with beating and torture at the hands of Toots. There is a knock on the door and it is Sheriff Wade asking for Temple. Nora answers the door and lets him in. Wade, it turns out, is looking for Sawyer, and Nora tells him they havent seen him. Wade says that's funny, because Sawyer called from there a short time ago. No one in the hotel speaks up and Wade's suspicion grows. Curly suggests that Sawyer must have stopped in, called, then left and is stuck in the storm. Wade then asks if they've seen the Osceolas, who they all deny having seen, as well. Wade leaves the hotel and as he gets back in his car and turns on the lights, he sees Sawyer's body, which the storm has carried back ashore. He investigates and sees that Sawyer has been shot several times. As he heads back for the hotel, he speaks to Rocco, who the Sheriff thinks is \"Mr. Brown\". Rocco tells him he didn't want to rat out the Temples, but the Indians were there during the storm, had just left. He insinuates the Osceolas killed Sawyer. Sheriff Wade runs toward the pier and encounters the Indians. He finds the Osceolas, who take off running. Wade shoots both of them dead. Rocco comes back into the hotel and is followed, after a few minutes, by Sheriff Wade, who tells them that their Indian friends killed Sawyer. He tells Temple he will hold him accountable as an accessory to the murder. Wade then tells Temple he killed the Osceola brothers. Wade begins to take a report and questions Rocco and his gang. He also questions Frank, whose anger is beginning to visibly show. As Wade questions the hotel group, Ziggy and his gang finally arrive, pretending to be tourists, and Sheriff Wade takes his leave. Toots herds Frank and the Temples into another room as Rocco and Ziggy exchange pleasantries and laughs. Curly retrieves the package for Ziggy and opens it up to reveal a large pile of money. Ziggy examines it, and it's clear it is counterfeit money that Rocco has had printed for Ziggy. Satisfied with the product, Ziggy pays Rocco with a bag of (presumably) real money. While the transaction is going down, in the other room, Gaye and Nora implore Frank to not go with Rocco as Rocco will kill him. They urge him to make a break for it in the dark. Frank tells them that his head tells him to do that, but his heart tells him otherwise. The transaction concluded, Ziggy and his gang take their leave. Rocco tells Ralph to bring everything down, including the soldier's gear. He asks Frank one last time if he will take them, and tells Toots to work him over. Frank relents and says he will come along. Rocco asks Nora if she wants to come too, but she ignores him, and stares at Frank. Rocco puts on his coat and slips a gun into the pocket. Gaye asks where her things are, and Rocco tells her she isnt going back with him, gives her some money and tells her \"that ought to be enough to stay drunk for a good long time\". Gaye lunges for Rocco, hangs all over him, and begs him to take her with him. She promises to stop drinking and threatens to commit suicide if he leaves her. She claws at him repeatedly, but he finally pushes her away where she runs into Frank and we see she has taken the gun from Rocco's pocket. She slips it to Frank, who hides it in his hat. The gang depart and head for the Temples' boat. Nora and Gaye watch to see if Frank makes a break for it, but he does not and gets on the boat with the gang. Frank takes command of the boat and they depart the dock as Nora and Gaye return to the hotel. Temple has tried to phone for help, but the lines are dead. Back on the boat, Curly asks Frank how they're doing, and Frank says they're right on course. Curly goes to the rear of the boat, where Toots is seasick and hanging over the side near the stern. Ralph is there with him, and Curly tells Ralph that Rocco and Angel are below deck sleeping. Curly returns to the wheelhouse and also goes down below. Below deck, there is a radio on and Angel, Rocco and Curly hear a radio report looking for the missing boat. Curly asks Rocco if it was a good idea to leave Gaye behind as she might squeal and get Ziggy in trouble. Rocco says \"Well...?\" as if that were his plan all along. Curly realizes this was the plan and they laugh. Back above deck, Frank checks his gun and then kills the throttle to the boat. He asks Ralph to look over the stern to see if the propeller is fouled with kelp. As Ralph leans over, Frank suddenly guns the throttle and cuts the wheel hard, tossing Ralph overboard. Toots, still seasick, realizes what has happened and reaches for his gun. Frank shoots him. Hearing the gunfire, Rocco, Angel and Curly start getting out of their bunks. Toots returns fire and shoots Frank in the side, but then falls over dead. Frank runs to the stern to retrieve Toots gun, and as he does, Curly comes up from below decks to see what happened, and Frank shoots him as he comes up the stairs. Curly falls down the stairs, and Frank climbs onto the roof of the wheelhouse. Curly stumbles into the cabin and Rocco asks him what's the matter, but Curly falls over dead. Rocco goes for his gun and finally realizes that it is gone, and that Gaye lifted it from his pocket in her farewell scene. Rocco retrieves Curly's gun from his dead hand instead and heads for the stairs. He yells for Toots and Ralph with no answer, then for \"Soldier\". Frank is on the roof of the wheelhouse looking down through the skylight, watching the stairwell. Rocco tells Angel to go upstairs. Angel says \"no, he will kill me\", but Rocco tells him there is nothing to fear, as Toots has killed Frank. Angel tells him if that's the case, then HE should go upstairs. Rocco responds by killing Angel, leaving only him and Frank alive on the boat. Rocco heads for the stairs and appeals to Frank, offering him a 50/50 stake as a partner. Frank answers only with silence. Rocco then says he knows what Frank wants, the whole stake for himself. Rocco then offers him ALL of the money and throws the bag through the stairwell door. Frank still does not respond. Rocco then has another fit of rage and threatens Frank, saying he's \"not big enough to do this to Rocco\" and he will kill him. Frank still does not respond. Rocco then says he knows what it is - Frank doesnt trust him because hes got a gun. So he takes Angel's gun and throws it up the stairs, implying that he is now unarmed. He tells Frank he is coming out now and begins up the stairs. \"I got no gun, I'm coming out\", he says, attempting to conceal his own gun in the process. As soon as Rocco crosses the doorway onto the deck, Frank shoots him from above. Rocco, hit, but not mortally, raises his gun, but Frank shoots him a second time. Rocco tries one more time, but Frank fires a third shot and Rocco collapses onto the deck. Frank comes down from the roof and immediately turns the boat around to return to Florida. He ties the wheel in place to hold his course and goes below deck to radio ashore and call for help. He requests help and asks to be connected to the Largo Hotel. Meanwhile, back at the hotel, Sheriff Wade is there and apparently Gaye has already turned on Ziggy. Sheriff Wade tells them Ziggy and his men were caught heading into Georgia and apologizes to Temple for killing the Osceolas. Gaye tells him it wasnt his fault and that no one is safe as long as Johnny Rocco is alive. As Gaye leaves with Sheriff Wade, the phone rings. Nora answers it and it is Frank. He tells her what has happened. She is relieved and tells her father that he's coming back to them. She opens a window and sunshine finally streams in. The film ends with Frank steering the boat back to his new home. The End.",

         "One of the finest of the great gangster melodramas KEY LARGO is still a firm favourite with fans and cultists alike. Produced by Jerry Wald in 1948 for Warner Bros. it was based on the stage play by Maxwell Anderson and was beautifully written for the screen by Richard Brooks and John Huston. Stunningly photographed in low key black & white by Karl Freund it was expertly directed with his customary flair by Huston. The cast assembled couldn't be better with Humphrey Bogart delivering one of his very best subdued performances and arguably being almost eclipsed by a riveting Ed. G. Robinson. The rest of the small cast is fleshed out with Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor and Thomas Gomez. And complimenting the on screen proceedings is the splendid music by the tireless Max Steiner who provided one of his best forties scores. It is 1946, the war in Europe is over and a returning GI (Humphrey Bogart) arrives at The Largo Hotel in Key Largo. Asked who he is Bogart coolly replies \"McCloud, Frank by John out of Helen\". He is here to meet with the hotel owner John Temple (Lionel Barrymore) to talk about the death of his son George Temple and how he lost his life in combat in Italy saving his unit. But McCloud notices that also staying in the hotel are a undesirable crowd of sinister looking characters. It's not long before he learns that they are a gang of mobsters led by an abrasive deported racketeer - the infamous Johnny Rocco (Robinson). When McCloud reveals who Rocco is and lists his many illegal and crooked enterprises the aging wheelchair bound John Temple gloweringly chides him \"You Filth\" which elicits little more than a snigger from Rocco. Then the gang declare themselves and display their violent ways (they murder the deputy sheriff) and make known their intention to force McCloud to sail them to Cuba. However after Rocco's moll (Claire Trevor) slips McCloud a gun he takes them on in a surprise move out at sea which makes for an intense and exciting sequence. The picture ends with McCloud's dispatch of the baddies and turning the boat around he heads back to Key Largo and The Largo Hotel where a new life awaits him. With some remarkable ensemble playing performances are top notch. Bogart gives one of his best portrayals in a likable reserved manner. Here proving yet again that he remains one of the most enduring icons of the silver screen. But there's little doubt KEY LARGO is Robinson's picture! His snarling and totally mean spirited Rocco is the best thing he has ever done. Good too are those in support especially Lionel Barrymore as the irascible aging hotelier, Lauren Bacall as Nora his daughter in-law and Claire Trevor giving a great turn as Rocco's moll in her Acadamy Award winning best supporting actress performance. And holding the whole thing together is Max Steiner's great score. His main theme is a lovely gentle anthem-like cue which points up the sadness of George Temple's death in the war and the loneliness now felt without him by his father and widow Nora. Also heard are some great action cues and an appropriate swirling piece for the Hurricane sequence. 1948 was a bumper year for the busy composer. In twelve months the man scored an unprecedented eleven films which included such amazing classics as \"Treasure Of The Sierra Madre\", \"Johnny Belinda\", \"Silver River\" the exceptional \"The Adventures Of Don Juan\" and of course KEY LARGO. KEY LARGO remains a memorable and enduring classic from Hollywood's Golden Age. In the tradition of the great noirs it exudes an engaging dramatic thrust throughout and an all encompassing intensity rarely felt in movies today. John Huston demonstrated yet again his prowess as one of film's outstanding directors and with his inspired casting in KEY LARGO the movie will forever maintain its appeal as long as there are movies and a place to screen them.. Footnote: It is interesting to note that the boat used in the final sequence was Bogart's own boat \"The Santana\".",
         "While chiefly remembered as a Bogart/Bacall vehicle, this story of expatriate gangsters commandeering a sleepy tropical hotel is, in actuality, a tightly directed ensemble piece with acting chops to burn. There's Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco--the brash, boisterous, sleazy gangster whose frailties (cowardice and a yearning for better times) gradually unfold before us. There's Lionel Barrymore as James Temple, the delightfully feisty and crusty hotel owner overcome with revulsion at Rocco's presence. There's Thomas Gomez, Harry Lewis, Dan Seymour and William Haade as Curly, Toots, Angel and Ralphie--Rocco's colorful but hard-edged thugs who are presences unto themselves. There's Claire Trevor as Gaye, Rocco's declining, alcoholic moll who symbolizes more than anything how far Rocco has fallen. That's an awful lot. Too much scenery-chewing from Bogart or Bacall would push it over the top--and director/screenwriter/demigod John Huston knows it. He coaxes remarkably restrained and subtle performances out of his star couple. The romantic tension between them is suggested but never shoved in the audience's face. Bogart's wandering war vet Frank McCloud keeps his lips tight and plays his cards close to the chest--a streetwise outsider through and through. Bacall's Nora Temple lets her anger and distaste pour out through her smoldering eyes more often than her mouth. Ultimately, the subtlety is so well-hidden between the gigantic performances of Robinson and Barrymore that you might miss just how sophisticated Frank's story is. Disillusioned and drifting since the war, he stops in to visit the wife (Nora) and father (James) of a fallen comrade whose bravery he admired. Implicit in his visit is an unspoken apology that it is he, and not their loved one, who is returning home. The fallen soldier is a constant unseen presence in the film--his bravery and honor mocking what Frank sees as his own cowardice and inability to stand up to Rocco (Bogart's fast-talking explanation of why he didn't shoot Rocco when he had the chance is classic and rare--a protagonist lying to his friends and his audience--\"One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for!\"). Frank's eventual decision to take on Rocco and his hoods is a victory against the fear that plagues and shames him. In a larger sense, this is a true period movie about a generation of men returning home from the greatest conflict the world has ever known. Most of our national memories of World War II are proud and triumphant, but, as with any war, it left countless people scarred physically and mentally. Though Frank is a decorated soldier, he feels somehow that what he did wasn't enough (because he lived and his friend did not?), and he returns back to a country in which he has no place with no real pride or satisfaction. The confrontation with Rocco affords him a chance (perhaps only possible in Hollywood or on the stage, where the story of \"Key Largo\" was first performed) to make things right with his world. While it has not aged as well as the better-known films of Bogart's and Huston's careers, \"Key Largo\" is a film that, for a little investment of attention and thought, will pay big dividends to anyone that really and truly loves movies.",
         "My favorite Bogart movie is also Key Largo. Even before Edward G. Robinson and his hoods take everyone hostage in Lionel Barrymore's hotel there is a tension that does not let up for one second. Movie goers had to be on the edge of their seats in 1948. There is one scene however that I don't think viewers today can fully appreciate. Lionel Barrymore had been acting from a wheelchair for 10 years and movie audiences were used to that. When Robinson and his goons goad him to a futile gesture of bravado, Barrymore rises from that chair and moves slowly towards the snickering Robinson. He swings and misses and falls down and Bogey and Bacall pick up Barrymore and bring him back to his wheelchair. The shock value of that scene for 1948 audiences would have a dimension that can't be appreciated now. Robinson's Johnny Rocco is based on Lucky Luciano who had been deported a few years back. He's evil incarnate and Humphrey Bogart as Frank McCloud is the jaded, cynical former idealist who redeems himself and becomes the countervailing force for good. They play well against each other in a reverse from the 1930s Warner gangster flicks where Robinson was usually the good guy. Who could have known this would be the fourth, last, and best of the Bogey and Bacall teamings.",
         "Key Largo is just one of John Huston's many memorable films that somehow always seem to transcend the intention--the Hollywood intention being to make a few bucks--and to this day still plays very well and indeed appears as something close to a work of art. It features what I think is one of Edward G. Robinson's finest performances as Johnny Rocco, a sociopathic gangster holding the off-season personnel of a seaside hotel hostage as he concludes a counterfeit money deal. The story begins as Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) pays a visit to the family of one of his G.I. buddies who was killed in Italy during WWII. He finds the welcome from the hotel's only \"guests\" chilly except for Gaye Dawn (a funny and perhaps prescient Hollywood stage name) played by Claire Trevor who is drunk and befriends him. After a bit McCloud discovers that the hotel's owner Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and her invalid father-in-law James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) have been tricked into allowing Rocco's gang to stay and now, as a tropical storm begins to blow, are being held at gunpoint. McCloud's delicate task is to keep the megalomaniac and murderous personality of Rocco under some control so that he doesn't murder everyone. Note that this is a splendid cast, and they all do a good job. Note too that Huston adapted this from a play by the versatile American playwright Maxwell Anderson. So the ingredients for a good film are clearly in place; and aside from some self-conscious mishmash with the Seminoles of Florida, this is a success. Anderson's desire to explore the psychopathic personality (some years later he adapted William March's novel The Bad Seed into a stage play) finds realization in Huston's direction and especially in Robinson's indelible performance. The utter disregard for the lives of others and the obsessive love of self that characterize the sociopath reek from the snares and callous laughter of the very sick Johnny Rocco. I especially liked the crazed and thrilled grin on his face when he emerges from the hold of the boat in the climactic scene, gun in hand, imagining that he has once again fooled his adversaries and is about to delightfully shoot Humphrey Bogart to death. What I loved about this scene was that Huston did not think it necessary to contrive a fight in which the good guy (Bogart) beats the bad guy by fighting fair. What happens is exactly what should happen, and without regard for the fine points of Marquis of Queensberry-type rules. Also good is Rocco beginning to sweat in fear of his life as the storm moves in while Bogey gives us his famous laugh and grin as he assesses the essential cowardice of the petty gangster. Lauren Bacall, in one of her more modest roles, does a lot without saying much, and Lionel Barrymore is very good as the cantankerous old guy in a wheelchair. Claire Trevor actually won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her work, and she was good as the alcoholic moll with a heart of gold. Robinson won nothing, but he really dominated the picture and demonstrated why he was one of Hollywood's greatest stars. Bottom line: watch this to see the gangster yarn meld into film noir with overtones of the psychoanalytical drama that characterized many of the black and white Hollywood films of the forties and early fifties. (Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",
         "Basically this film is almost like a play. The whole story is more or less (apart from the ending) shot in a rustic Florida hotel. A great location and setting, a real credit to John Huston. In short, Frank McCloud (Bogart) an ex war hero and living at no-fixed-address, visits (by request) his dead war buddy's father (barrymore) & widow (Bacall). As he arrives, it doesn't take long for Frank to work out the Hotel is temporarily hostage to a big mob gangster - Rocco (robinson) and his cronies. The film instantly grabs you, it looks beautiful, there is a lot of substance and well thought out scripts, nothing glamorous or smart, just very good story telling. A good side line to the story, are the Native American clan, who due to an approaching hurricane need to find shelter, their plight is placed nicely into the story. There is a scene in which Bacall introduces Bogart to the oldest member of the clan, a 100 and something year old Native woman which is just so genuine, I still don't believe this woman was an actress, Huston must have improvised this into the script. Not only is Bogart superb in this, but also the whole cast. It goes without saying Edward G Robinson's performance was second to none as to was - his right hand man (Harry Lewis I think), Bacall & Rocco's girlfriend - Ziggy..pretty much the entire cast. The whole thing ties up well, without Spoilers it does have a great ending. This is a must not just for Bogie fans but for anyone who can appreciate an intelligent film. -Paul Browne.",
         "It is difficult to resist the temptation to compare William Wyler's \"The Desperate Hours\" with John Huston's \"Key Largo.\" Here again the drama arose when a gangster and his thugs sought a temporary hideout by moving in on an innocent family, and were unable to get away until a raging hurricane had blown itself out\u0085 The family were Lionel Barrymore, complete with wheelchair, and Lauren Bacall, apparently without make-up\u0097stunningly attractive\u0085 Their home was a small hotel in Florida, and \"just passing through\" was a tough and somewhat mixed-up good guy Humphrey Bogart\u0085 The gangster was Edward G. Robinson\u0085 For Bogart \"Key Largo\" was another \"The Petrified Forest,\" but this time he was the disenchanted idealist and Edward G. Robinson the vicious, antiquated symbol of raw brute force\u0085 Paul Muni had appeared in the original Maxwell Anderson play in 1939, and director John Huston and Richard Brooks updated the piece to make it more contemporary\u0085 As a film, it was treated in a slightly heavy-handed, overly talky manner, displacing action in favor of strong character studies of a group of disparate individuals trapped by a kingpin gangster\u0085 Claire Trevor won an Academy Award as Gaye Dawn, Rocco's boozy mistress who was willing to lower herself to any depths for the mere expedient of getting a drink\u0085 She is finally pushed too far by Rocco, has accepted too many insults and been rejected once too often, so she decides to help the besieged prisoners\u0085 Lauren Bacall was Nora Temple, an antiseptic dreamer who persisted in believing that evil should always be opposed by a valiant Sir Galahad and temporarily has her illusions shattered when Bogart apparently doesn't agree to fit into her mold\u0085 As Bacall's grandfather, Lionel Barrymore was another heroic figure who, could afford to be a verbal hero, knowing that a retreat to the safety of his confining wheelchair could protect him\u0085 Edward G. Robinson as Rocco was a mass of contradictions\u0085 Brutal with a gun safely in his hand, dreaming of the glories he once knew in the good old days when he was a big shot, all he has left are the memories\u0085 He was a man whose criminal wisdom permits no ethics and few feelings\u0085 He offers Bogart an empty gun to shoot it out with him... He is also a man afraid, who sweats when the hurricane approaches and poses a threat to his safety... He detests Bogart because of his wartime heroism, mocking and taunting him because his courage is something differing in Rocco's own unheroic life\u0085 As war hero Frank McCloud, Bogart was the most complex character of all\u0085 Disillusioned, tired of his war-induced killings, unwilling to risk himself in any new test of courage (\"One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for\"), he is now a complacent shadow of his former noble self\u0085 He, like Barrymore, seeks an idyllic world where \"there's no place for Johnny Rocco.\" However, his pattern has been too well established\u0085 He, like Claire Trevor, can be pushed only so far and then reason and restraint seem no longer acceptable as an alternative to action\u0085 With such a cast \"Key Largo\" could not fall to hold the attention\u0085 Yet, for all its workmanlike craft, it did not reach the level of Wyler's \"The Desperate Hours.\" Bogart, as a disillusioned war veteran who could not rouse himself to action until the last few minutes, left one frustrated: looking for the vicious power that he was to show as the gangster in the later film\u0085 Edward G. Robinson, commanding, convincing, was still not so coldly frightening a villain as Humphrey Bogart\u0085 And, one can imagine how the idea of the storming hurricane appealed at the time\u0085 The violence and the drama outside, as the wind tore at the palm trees and the waves threatened to swallow the little wooden hotel, would surely underscore and heighten the tensions within... Not so! And not only because the studio storm was not always up to nature's level... What William Wyler realized was that the suspense of innocence trapped as hostages by wickedness was vastly heightened by the contrast with a quiet, undramatic, everyday setting\u0085 No hurricane was needed to put the desperation in \"The Desperate Hours.\"",
         "When I think of the colorized version that, regrettably, is the only copy of this excellent film noir in my video store, I can't help but think of a comment Orson Welles made to a friend a few days before his death in regards to Turner's plans to colorize \"Citizen Kane\"(thankfully defeated, because of the fact that it came under Welles' original contract with RKO, which specified that only Welles would make changes): \"Keep Turner and his g**d*** Crayolas away from my movie.\" Watching this version of \"Key Largo\" more than proves Welles' point; the lighting becomes terrible in several key scenes, particularly the closing ones on the boat, to whereas before, you could see what was going on, now you can just barely tell a thing. That said, it can't destroy the fine work that this film truly is. I was led to this film by my mother, who called it one of her favorites from Bogie (another being \"The African Queen\") and now I can see why. Leave it to John Huston, the man who was bold enough to make a true adaptation of Dashiell Hammet's \"The Maltese Falcon\", to give us a tightly woven drama that never feels forced. Bogie's Frank McCloud is probably the most silent of all the strong-silent types he ever played, barely saying more than is necessary for the scene he's in. Such reticience leaves some large blanks for the audience to fill; though he says that he doesn't care one way or another, I really don't believe him. The feeling I get the entire time he's in the clutches of Johnny Rocco's gang is that he's just waiting for his moment. After all, you don't survive WWII's Italian campaign and not know when it's best to stay still and when it's best to make your play. That's why he threw away the gun offered to him by Rocco; no way was Rocco's gang just going to let their boss be gunned down even if the deck was stacked in Rocco's favor. The murders of the deputy and the Indians on the lam just adds to the need to take care of business. I was a little disappointed to see Bacall in such a minor role (it still had to be better than what she was given, sans Bogie, after this film, from reports I've heard), but her spitting in Rocco's face is an undeniably powerful moment. As for Edward G. Robinson, one of Hollywood's original tough guys imported from Bucharest, Romania, he literally runs away with the part of Johnny Rocco, the former big-shot with delusions of grandeur. He's a casually vicious, ruthless fount of hate, bitter over his fallen status and hungering for a comeback. But he still fails to draw an important lesson from his soused ex-galpal: times change and not necessarily for the better. He may have defied a ton of police in his day or gun down a deputy in this one, but it still doesn't change the fact that the outside world (nicely symbolized by the hurricane) can and will eat him alive without the slightest trace of indigestion. All Rocco is is a dinosaur: proud, strong, but too stupid to realize that his kind have become extinct. In fact, that may very well be why McCloud was such a natural match for Rocco as an opponent. McCloud had changed his spots many times in his life to fit the job situation he was in, while Rocco has never been anything else but what he is now. Small wonder that one can see the confrontation between them coming to full steam. This core element, and all the others mentioned and not mentioned here, help make \"Key Largo\" one of the great unsung classics of Humphrey Bogart AND Edward G. Robinson. Here's looking at you, tough guys.",
         "Obviously someone below couldn't tell a well directed, highly regarded classic film the likes of Key Largo from a Turkey Sandwich - but thanks for the remedial effort nonetheless. This movie doesn't get the attention of a Casablanca or a Maltese Falcon, but it's definitely one to see - and not just for the giants on the screen. The build up of tension between the main characters is set well against the backdrop of the impending storm seemingly threatening to cave their hotel in literally and figuratively. Frank's character arc from jaded passiveness to the restrained heroism he is inescapably drawn towards has been seen in other Bogie characters, but usually those guys were either willing participants on the trigger end of their guns, or they were fulfilling their own agendas as well. However Frank McCloud has no ulterior motives. Here, there is a refreshing change from the usual Bogie-isms; Frank doesnt engage in any verbal bravado with Rocco, there are no confident smirks on his face, or promises to 'get even' later. As for Barrymore, he was just simply an acting genius. Look no further than the scene with him getting out of his wheelchair in a futile attempt to fight Rocco as proof. Fantastic. E.G. Robinson delivers his vitriol so well on-screen, you cant help but hate his guts and wait for his come-uppance. Both Barrymore and EGR were great at delivering speeches - extended lines of dialogue while 'flying solo' - you can almost here the room go quiet as they worked the script. Lauren Bacall's chemistry with her Husband was so natural and unforced, even the scenes with no dialogue show how much they were in love - albeit true she doesnt exactly carry the workload in this one. Some of the scenes with the Indians seem a little odd, but it still works in the context of the entire movie. Don't overlook this great film!",
         "\"Key Largo\" was the second collaboration between Humphrey Bogart and John Houston during 1948 (the other being \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre). Both films represent both artists at the peak of their respective careers. \"Key Largo\" is about a group of gangsters who have taken over a hotel located on Key Largo. Along comes Bogey, who has come to visit the father of a war time pal who was killed, and of course, gets drawn into the drama. Huston's cast is flawless. Bogart as Frank McCloud is suitably laid back and brave as he confronts the gangsters headed by Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco. Lauren Bacall plays the widow of Bogey's war time friend and the venerable Lionel Barrymore is outstanding as Temple, the hotel proprietor. Claire Trevor plays Rocco's moll Gaye Dawn, an alcoholic former singer for which she deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Appearing as as Rocco's henchmen are veterans Thomas Gomez and Dan Seymour and Harry Lewis as Toots a \"Wilmer\" type character (from \"The Maltese Falcon\"). Monte Blue and John Rodney represent the law. Bogart and Robinson appeared together many times during the 30s with Robinson usually playing the hero and Bogey the heavy. This time their roles are reversed. This film was unfortunately, the last time Bogart and Robinson appeared together. It's a pity because they always played against each other so well. I always liked Robinson better on the wrong side of the law. His Rocco is a slimy brutal villain. He even gets to slap Bogey around in this one. It is interesting to note the name of the boat that the gang make their getaway on is called \"Santana\". Santana was the name of Bogey's own personal boat and the name of his production company.",
         "Humphrey Bogart and John Huston must be considered the artistic equivalent of De Niro-Scorsese. Huston and Bogie made several films together, this being one of their best. But there is another combo that comes to an end in cinema's history: Bogie and Bacall appear on screen for the final time together. It is their finest collaboration. Edward G. Robinson, \"Little Caesar\" himself, returns to gangster form after years of playing the good guy (Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY, Welles' THE STRANGER) and has one of the more memorable entrances in film villain history. We see him in a tub, smoking, a fan in front of him. He seems to be decaying in a way, but \"Johnny Rocco\" is still to be reckoned with. This is the Robinson we all love, demented and wise, sinister yet humorous. The Largo Hotel is the setting and a hurricane of drama, heroism, and rain is coming. Huston stages the film much like the play it is based on, yet we never feel confined. There is enough colorful dialogue to go around. Surprisingly, much of it is not by Bogart, who plays probably his most quiet role, promoting his character through facial gestures more than words. He plays off Robinson and his posse of mobsters perfectly in this way, allowing Edward G. to dominate the majority of the film, which is the point. Lionel Barrymore plays the chair-ridden owner of the Largo and his daughter Bacall is falling in love with Bogart, naturally. They are at the mercy of Rocco and his boys, all of whom have some itchy trigger fingers. Bogart is just buying his time to make his move. The finale is extremely well done and foresees suspense endings to come. Lauren Bacall is one of the most beautiful actresses to grace the screen, especially in black and white. Her perfect features look sculpted in this light and her sensual stare is enough to make you melt. Her smoky voice and attitude is an excellent match for Bogie's simple, heroic character. Film Noir becomes Florida Noir here, as the lightening outside the windows of the hotel play games with the shadows and atmosphere of events inside. Robinson murders an innocent man with the look of a terrifying ghost, lightening flashing on him and all. The thunder substitutes for the sound of cars and street-life normally heard in classic noir pictures. KEY LARGO is a very good film, dark and suspenseful, in the most pleasant of locales.

         "Frank McCloud travels to a run-down hotel on Key Largo to honor the memory of a friend who died bravely in his unit during WW II. His friend's widow, Nora Temple, and wheelchair bound father, James Temple manage the hotel and receive him warmly, but the three of them soon find themselves virtual prisoners when the hotel is taken over by a mob of gangsters led by Johnny Rocco who hole up there to await the passing of a hurricane. Mr. Temple strongly reviles Rocco but due to his infirmities can only confront him verbally. Having become disillusioned by the violence of war, Frank is reluctant to act, but Rocco's demeaning treatment of his alcoholic moll, Gaye Dawn, and his complicity in the deaths of some innocent Seminole Indians and a deputy sheriff start to motivate McCloud to overcome his Hamlet-like inaction.",
