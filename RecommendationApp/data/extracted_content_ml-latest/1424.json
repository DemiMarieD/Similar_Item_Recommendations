         "I saw this movie very late one night, while channel surfing just before I hit the sack. I spotted Eric Stoltz, and decided to watch for a little while, as I think he's a very talented actor. I got drawn into the movie completely, and it made an impression on me. The story concerns Martin Strydom, a white man living in south africa, arrested for collaboration with anti-apartheid terrorists. It is told as a series of flashbacks, as the prison warden who held him is being investigated, many years later, by Louis Gosset Junior. From the first day, Martin is put through a brutal campaign of psychological torture, instigated by the warden, who lies to him to make him believe that all of his friends and family have disowned him. I wont give any of the plot twists away (there are a few) but I will say, go and watch it. Its not funny, its not action packed, but it is a good movie",
         "This movie is nothing short of a dark, gritty masterpiece. I may be bias, as the Apartheid era is an area I've always felt for. But I'd say it ranks right up with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Sadly up until a few days ago I'd never even heard of this movie. Inside is one of the most underrated films of all time, probably because it was a small film company, I'd never even heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is believable and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his dastardly role well. Do not look for humor in this film, there is none. It is real, savage and gritty to the last, and to the sensitive I'd say bring a box of tissues. But movies as great as this make you wonder, why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of?",
         "Have just finished watching this film, which upset me greatly. Have also been to South Africa twice, around the time this film is set. It is certainly hard-hitting, and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene'. The slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break, and there are certainly few light moments. Will never be able to view Nigel Hawthorne the same again. He came across as a very twisted individual, and I found myself disliking him more each time he appeared. Totally agree with Steve-thomp's articulate and well thought-out comments.",
         "I saw this film the other night, together with another film about the Apartheid in South Africa, A DRY WHITE SEASON, and this was by far the weakest of the two. The other one is not a masterpiece either, but at least you get to know more about the issue than in this film. Here, we have 90 minutes of people being tortured by a sadistic colonel(Nigel Hawthorne), with no real depth to it. It's all presented in a rather cold fashion too. The actors are good however and this is not a really bad film, it's just that if you want to see a film about this subject, you better watch A DRY WHITE SEASON. 5/10"
