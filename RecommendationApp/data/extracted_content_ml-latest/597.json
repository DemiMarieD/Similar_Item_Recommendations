      "synopsis": "A very successful, wealthy lawyer, Edward Lewis, hires a beautiful and unlikely prostitute, Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts), from Sunset Blvd to bring along to various business events. An attraction developes between the two, and Edward finds it harder and harder to let the infectious, kind-hearted Vivian go. Businessman Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) breaks up with his girlfriend, who doesn't want to be at his \"beck and call\" at a swanky party held by his partner Philip Stuckey, and cuts loose in Stuckey's Lotus. He gets lost and stops along Hollywood Boulevard for directions from hooker Vivenne Ward (Julia Roberts). She charges, gets in and ends up driving him to his hotel in Beverley Hills. He asks her up to his penthouse suite on a whim and pays her to stay all night, although seems uncomfortable at first. The following morning he asks her to stay all week for $3000. He also gives her money for clothes and says she needs to be at his \"beck and call\" with no strings attached. She calls her room-mate Kit (Laura San Giacomo) to leave her money for the rent, and goes shopping on Rodeo Drive for more appropriate clothes. However, snooty saleswomen won't serve her as she is still dressed like a hooker, and she returns to the hotel, where she gets stopped by the hotel manager, Barney (Hector Elizondo). He wants to make it clear that they are making an exception having her at the hotel as Edward is such a special guest. Vivienne gets upset as she still has no outfit for dinner, and Barney helps her, along with coaching her on dinner etiquette. When Edwards returns, he is amazed by Vivienne's new look. The business dinner goes well, but Edward is preoccupied with the deal afterwards. The next day, Vivienne tells him about the experience shoppingt the previous day, and Edward takes her back to spend an obscene amount of money on clothes, leaving her to go back to his work as she is transformed from hooker to lady. She goes back to the shop from the previous day to show them the big mistake they made! Back at hotel, she looks like a genuine guest, but when Edward gets home he is still busy with work, and they take a bath together and talk into the night about their pasts and how they ended up where they are today. The following day, Edward takes Vivienne to the polo. While Vivienne chats to David Morse, the grandson of the man involved in Edward's latest deal, Philip is worried she is a spy. Edward reassures him by telling him how they met, and Philip then comes on to Vivienne. When they return to the hotel, she is furious with Edward for telling him, and plans to leave, but he persuades her to see out the week. Edward leaves work early the next day and takes Vivienne on a date to the Opera in his private jet. She clearly is moved by the music, and says \"If I forget to tell you later, I had a wonderful time tonight\". On returning to the hotel, he falls asleep (the first time we have seen this) while she is getting ready for bed, and she kisses him on the lips - she doesn't do this with clients - and they make love as partners, rather than client and hooker. Over breakfast, Edward offers to put her up in an apartment so he can continue seeing her, but she feels insulted and says this is not the fairytale she wants. He then goes off to work without resolving the situation. Kit comes to the hotel and sees that she has fallen for him, but she denies it. Edward meets Morse, about to close the deal, and changes his mind at the last minute. His time with Vivienne has shown him another way of being - taking time off and enjoying life - and working. He wants to create things rather than just making money. Philip is livid, and goes to the hotel. Vivienne is there and he blames her for changing Edward - he comes onto her again, and then hits her before Edward returns and pulls him off and chucks him out. Vivienne leaves, and is seen back at home with Kit, packing up to leave for San Franscisco. Edward gets into the car with the chauffeur that took her home, and rather than going to the airport, he goes to her apartment and climbs up the fire escpae (despite being afraid of heights) with a rose in his mouth, to woo her like in a fairy-story.",

         "Obviously similar to Shaw's \"Pygmalion\", but updated, more modern. A lovely dream, one very old: rescuing a prostitute from the street. (Not in Woody Allen's sickish-moody way.) However, if you wish to dream this one, be sure you do NOT start to think very logically . . . She is healthy, not on drugs, not on alcohol, not even a smoker; no syphilis, no gonorrhea, no AIDS wounds on her legs, nothing, she is just perfectly absolutely healthy. Body and mind. She is not a criminal, not inclined to steal anything, she even values love and dignity more than money. Oh, she has no pimp, who would be the other man (other than Richard Gere) in her life; nobody to protect her from smart types who walk off without paying; the pimp would explode the whole romance instantly. (Instead, a girl friend.) She has a golden soul, full of goodness, and loves art, and feels for art. High-society types around them appear silly, artificial, stuffy. (Different forks.) She is natural. She even was a good student (!) and . . . might be again? She loves to bathe, and half the time we see her happy in the bath tub (which is a powerful signal and symbol for CLEAN, CLEAN; she even sings so super-ultra-charmingly in the bath; she wants to wash off the foolishness of her previous few months of street. And she can do it. But with all those qualities, WHY would she ever become a prostitute in the first place? Don't think, don't think. Just dream, it is lovely.",
         "What is it about this movie that made it such an instant mega smash when it was released? I'm not sure if it's The incredible chemistry between Gear and Roberts, the smart dialog, the storyline-combination of all of the above-etc etc. But I do think These days, so few GREAT romantic comedies get made. Pretty woman is great. I enjoyed every moment of this and have seen it many times. I haven't read any IMDb reviews of this yet, I wanted to comment first. This is a lovely story of hope and the true purity of falling madly in love-there are so many movies that try to be romantic and inevitably come across looking forced and contrived. The story and acting in Pretty woman, while very obviously being \"Hollywood\" to a tee, are so natural and free flowing, that it's just a joy to watch this. It's also great to see(in what's not usually the case) a romantic comedy that gets it right, in every area from casting to dialog to pretty much everything from start to finish. Great movie!",
         "\"the bad stuff is easier to believe. you ever notice that?\" - vivian ok, so pretty woman is a romantic movie, its cliched, its corny, its sappy. but hey, beyond all that is a special movie with some very special performances. julia roberts as vivian ward is absolutely adorable, one of the most lovable characters of alltime. and those long legs help - like she says - \" 88\" of therapy for the bargain price of $3000\" the movie has many memorable lines and if you fall in love with the movie you will go back to it again and again. this is easily the best romantic comedy movie of the 90s. though many movies have hence tried to recreate its charm, nothing has quite succeeded to replace this movie as the pinnacle of the genre. and this ofcourse is high praise from someone who hates the genre. the story ofcourse is very predictable and cinderella like. however this is beautifully told and the on-screen chemistry between the very dashing richard gere and julia roberts is simply sensational. an absolute must for fans of romance, comedy, any kind of light hearted movies or for those who are big fans of julia or richard. watch this movie. an enjoyable 8!",
         "Wow! Richard Gere and Julia Roberts give magical performances as a shrewd businessman and a lovely prostitute. I was really moved by the blend of humor and romance. The romance was what really moved me. I thought that Edward (Richard Gere) and Vivian (Julia Roberts) looked good in the attire they wore to the opera in San Francisco. Oh, boy, if you ask me, Julia Roberts did, indeed, look like a pretty woman in this movie. PRETTY WOMAN really tugged at my heart and soul and made me laugh at times. Don't say I have a twisted sense of humor, but I laughed really hard when Edward yelled at Stuckey (Jason Alexander) to get out of his hotel room. If I ever travel to Beverly Hills, I'm going to stay at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, that is, if I can afford it. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I think Richard Gere and Julia Roberts each deserved an Academy Award for their performances. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this star-studded hit to anyone who's a fan of Richard Gere or Julia Roberts. You'll laugh, you might cry, you'll be touched, and you'll want to see this box-office smash over and over again.",
         "Pure Hollywood fluff story that is so smart and sports such a dynamite cast that it becomes one of the more wonderful films of the period. \"Pretty Woman\" is pop culture at its finest as Julia Roberts (in an Oscar-nominated, icon-making role) is a prostitute on the mean streets of Los Angeles who gets a big financial break one night when she meets up with cold, but lonely business guru Richard Gere. They immediately create a bond and have a night of passion which soon becomes a week-long partnership with Gere and Roberts posing as love interests (and of course $3000 is involved as well). Could it be possible that Roberts, a lady with a heart of gold in spite of her background, is just the thing Gere has been needing in his life? A trumped-up adult-oriented version of \"Cinderella\" is probably the best way to describe \"Pretty Woman\". The old Hollywood story gets a glossy new look thanks to director Garry Marshall (doing arguably his finest film-making work). Gere and Roberts make for one of the more attractive pairs the cinema has ever seen. They just shine beacons of light on one another it seems. The fact that both are very good performers definitely enhance their appearances though. A smashing soundtrack and that vivid 1980s style (even though this was released in 1990) make \"Pretty Woman\" one of the big winners of the last few years. 4 stars out of 5.",
         "What can I say that hasn't been said? This immensely popular, modern fairy tale romance is a fantastic 'feel good' must see. I can't resist watching it every single time it comes on TV. To tempt you if you haven't seen it...it's the story of a feisty, good hearted hooker named Vivian Ward, who is hired for a week by a wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, to serve as his escort at a number of business related social functions. Needless to say, the relationship doesn't stay 'just business' for long. Rather than the plot itself, the beautiful Julia Roberts makes this movie...and not simply because of her 88 inches of leg! Always endearing in her roles, she is at her absolute MOST endearing portraying Vivian in this picture. She brings a real vulnerability to the role, showing us that just like everyone else, prostitutes do indeed floss their teeth! Richard Gere pulls off quite convincingly the role of Edward, the ruthless, calculating millionaire businessman, who takes over companies only to sell them off piece by piece, quite unmindful of the interests of any people involved. To give Gere credit, I was quite impressed that he actually plays the piano in one of the movie's scenes. Naturally, given Vivian's membership in the 'oldest profession', there is sex early on...though I, old fashioned and strict as I am, wouldn't hesitate to let my young teen see this movie. (There's worse in TV commercials today!) Oddly, the most truly intimate moment in this film is not during the more explicit sex but rather, simply a kiss. Ohhhh, lots of romantic scenes, from a picnic in the park to jetting off in a private plane for a Big Night on the Town. And etiquette lessons...Vivian displays charming, amusing, curious innocence when she experiences with Edward her first opera (all the while looking knock out gorgeous in a stunning red gown), her first polo match, and her introduction to escargots. As the movie progresses, she is transformed Pygmalion style, from the street smart hooker provocatively dressed in tall black boots and mini skirt, to a sophisticated looking, elegantly gowned and coiffed young lady. But it's merely appearance...Vivian's heart of gold and her vulnerability both remain unchanged. The status conscious snobbery of Beverly Hills dress shops and ritzy hotels, judging people by wealth and class, is well depicted here. When Vivian goes shopping for a 'more appropriate' wardrobe at some exclusive Rodeo Drive boutiques, she is not 'well received' by the sales ladies, who like all too many of us, are overly inclined to judge by appearance. You'll want these snobs to get their comeuppance. Actually, perhaps the most touching relationship in this entire film is the one between Vivian and Barney, the quite proper but kind desk manager at the high class hotel (where she is sharing a penthouse suite with Edward), who is able to see beyond appearance. He develops a genuine fondness and even more importantly, respect for her. Other characters of interest...Kit is Vivian's appealing and sympathetic room-mate, also a hooker (Vivian's a loyal friend), and Stuckey is Edward's sleazy and despicable business colleague, portrayed by Seinfeld's Jason Alexander, a TV show which I must confess is not my favourite. As events unfold during the film, it becomes clear that, while Edward might not understand too clearly the meaning of 'prostitution', Vivian clearly does. And, it's another shining film illustration of that pearl of wisdom from Eliza Doolittle (of My Fair Lady) who enlightened us, 'The difference between a flower girl and a lady is not how she behaves, but how she is treated.' Or, in Vivian's own words, 'People put you down enough, you start to believe it'. Great Cinderella movie...don't miss it.",
         "\"This is Hollywood where people come to fulfill their dreams! Some dreams come true and some don't! Believe in your dreams!\" While visiting Los Angeles for a week, Edward Lewis borrows his friend's car and gets lost on Hollywood Boulevard... He asks a hooker for directions... She proposes to help him for 5 dollars... For $20, she accepted to show him where the stars live... Edward invites her to join him in his hotel suite, but not for sex... Enjoying her company, he offers her to be his 'date' for a series of business activities including a strategic dinner and a pool match... Out of the 'bargain,' she gets $3,000 cash, a classier wardrobe and a visit to the opera... All the characters of the film are convincing, original and sympathetic, feeling comfortable with each other... Director Gary Marshall did a great job... Ideal for the role is Richard Gere... He plays the terrific rescuer who 'free' Vivian from the streets conducting her to his penthouse suite... He is handsome, charming and shy... 'Henry Higgins' at his best... But Edward Lewis is a millionaire... He buys companies that are in financial difficulty... He takes them apart and sells the pieces for more than he paid for the whole... \"It's strictly business\", he tells Vivian... \"You and I are both such similar people. We both screw people for money.\" Edward's only defect is that he hurts what he loves... He wins a certain imaginative power by how painful that treason is... Julia Roberts plays Vivian Ward, an attractive and smart hooker with a heart of gold... She gives her character a great sense of humor, charming Edward with her honesty... She is intensely appealing and amusing, making any man feel comfortable... Into the snobbish clothing store, she delivers a great exit line, just devastating the saleswomen... The song is terrific as the scene... In the hotel lobby, she walks in a 'killer' red dress... She learns which fork to use in the formal dinner meeting, projecting an escargot through the air... At the opera she innocently asks: \"Where's the band?\" There's more than a touch of Eliza Dolittle in her role, specially when she decides she wants more from Edward than money... She gets the perfect rescue scene with a limousine, a fire escape, a balcony, birds, music and red flowers... Hector Elizondo turns a supporting role into more than that... He plays the formal, intolerant hotel manager... He takes an affection to his best customer's \"niece\" and trains her on which fork to use at a fancy dinner... His amusing performance as Edward's smooth competent hotel manager nearly shapes Roberts and Gere... Ralph Bellamy is incredibly good as the aging millionaire, creator of a small company Edward is trying to take to pieces... Laura San Giacomo plays Vivian's pal roommate, her first role since she played the amorous sister in \"sex, lies & videotape.\" \"Pretty Woman\" is a contemporary Hollywood fairy tale, a sweet romantic comedy, an innocent love story in the middle of self-interest and agreement... It remains as an entertaining motion picture that had women calling out the delights of true love... Keep on dreaming!",
         "I love this movie...like a Cinderella story for adults, with facts of the real world: a human (and man) fairy godmother for example, a prince, everything!!! About Julia, what can I said? I'm a very big fan, and the way She transforms a prostitute into a princess is phenomenal, She make it real too. Richard Gere was a 80's prince charming, no perfect but with a lot of things that make you said: \"I want one for home\". Maybe if you are 20 or younger you'll be no identify with the music, but for oldie's: \"It must have been love\" and \"What women do\" will take you to your best times! If you like romantic stories, that make you smile, cry and dream, this is the ideal and No.1!!!!",
         "This was the ultimate example of Hollywood glorifying prostitutes and showing them to be gorgeous (and basically good-hearted) women. I do NOT speak from experience but from number of real-life cop-friends I can tell you this: you average hooker looks the OPPOSITE of Julia Roberts (or Melanie Griffth or Elizabeth Shue and all the rest of the hooker-hotties Hollywood throws at us.) Hokey? Definitely, but it's still a fun movie which has entertained most people who have watched it the past 15 years. Roberts and Richard Gere certainly make a handsome couple. Hector Elizondo almost steals the show with his minor role as \"Barney,\" the hotel manager. He is definitely the most humorous character in the film. It's a funny, charming and romantic film that was a big hit. Just don't believe it when Hollywood continues to glamorize the worst aspects of society, something it always does.",
         "Sometimes you have a romantic comedy that is remembered for a long time. Movies with Audrey Hepburn, 'When Harry Met Sally...', little parts from other Meg Ryan-movies and... 'Pretty Woman'. Of course we have the famous song and the real launch of the Julia Roberts career that help a little but it just is one sweet and very funny movie. Julia Roberts is great in romantic comedies and especially with this movie (and 'Notting Hill') she proves this. With Richard Gere she has a perfect chemistry and in the end that is all we want to see. That Roberts is a prostitute and Gere a very rich man, living in a penthouse, make things only more interesting, joke-wise. One of the better romantic comedies made in the past and definitely one to watch again. And again. And may be again."
