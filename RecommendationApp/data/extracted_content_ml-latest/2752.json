      "synopsis": "In New York City, refined actress and former ballerina Lauren Ames (Shelley Long) finally has a chance to study with the great theater professor Stanislav Korzenowski (Robert Prosky). Sandy Brozinsky (Bette Midler), a brash, loud actress, decides through happenstance to also study with Korzenowski. Lauren and Sandy take an instant dislike to each other when they first meet in Korzenowski's class, but unknown to each other, both women begin dating the same man, Michael Sanders (Peter Coyote). When Michael \"dies\" in a gas explosion at a local store, Lauren and Sandy figure out that Michael may have faked his death when they meet at the local morgue and see that the body recovered cannot be Michael's. So, the two women form an uneven alliance to follow leads across the country to find him and force him to choose between them. During their quest, Lauren and Sandy are chased by CIA agents, as well as Russian assassins who are also after Michael. When Lauren and Sandy finally find Michael, he tries to kill both of them for \"leaving loose ends\" and they are forced to run until they are captured by the federal agents. It is here that Lauren and Sandy learn that Michael is a double agent for the CIA who has now gone rogue, also working for the KGB, and that he has stolen a toxin that could destroy huge areas of nature with just a few drops. The CIA wants to find Michael to force him to give back the toxin bio-weapon, while the Russian assassins are men cheated by the double agent who work for Korzenowski, the ladies theater professor who is a Russian sleeper agent using his class to pass on US state secrets. The chase leads to rural Arizona where Lauren and Sandy sneak into a local brothel where Michael is and steal the toxin vial from him while he is asleep. But when he wakes up, Lauren is taken hostage by Michael and his rogue associates while Sandy gets away with the toxin. Michael then contacts the CIA to force a trade with the CIA for the toxin for Lauren's life, and with Korzenowski with the stolen cash he intended to give to Michael. When the trade goes awry, Lauren gets away with both the money and the toxin, with Michael in hot pursuit. Cornered on a series of mountain tops, Lauren uses her former ballet skills to evade him, culminating in a grand Jeté, as pursuing Michael slips and falls to his death on the rocks far below whilst the money is lost to native Indians. In the final scene, Lauren and Sandy return to New York where they finally form a lasting friendship, and go on to perform Hamlet together, with Lauren in the title role.",

         "Peter Coyote did not know what he was letting himself in for in Outrageous Fortune when he started kanoodling with both Bette Midler and Shelley Long, both fellow students in Robert Prosky's acting class. You do got to wonder what to make of a guy who's attracted to such opposite types as Long and Midler. Shelley expands a bit on her famous Diane Chambers character from Cheers. And Bette Midler is simply Bette Midler and that's good enough for me. These two naturally don't hit it off, but when Coyote turns up as the victim of a bomb blast, both Midler and Long show up to say they're next of kin. Upon examination of the lower extremity of the burned cadaver which is all that's left, the two of them come to the same conclusion it's definitely not Coyote. Long and Midler just want to find this guy and get an explanation for his behavior and to find out who he really prefers. But there's a lot more to Coyote as the two of them on a merry chase that takes them to the New Mexico desert find out. Besides those already mentioned look for good performances from John Schuck as the rather rigid thinking CIA man and George Carlin as a droll and philosophical Indian. You can't say there aren't any more good women's roles being written when you see Long and Midler in Outrageous Fortune.",
         "This is one of my favorite movies. It is a little cheesy, but that's what makes it really funny. Bettey Midler and Shelley Long are hilarious together. One of the funniest scenes is where they are in the whorehouse looking for Their boyfriend. They put their ears to the door, and hear sexual noise coming from the first door. When they put their ears to the second door, they hear a goat. Finally, they recognize his \"Oh God, Oh God, Oooooh Yeeeeeeah!\" as he passes out. There are many other hilarious scenes in this movie. If you're in the mood for a good laugh, you will not be disappointed in this movie.",
         "I saw this movie originally when it was first released at the theaters. I again saw it later when it made it to cable, eg. HBO, Cinemax. ect. I loved the movie but then saw the edited version when it came to network. They cut out a lot of the adult humour. Examples: When Bette says \"Gee, you thought I was going to go in and pee on him.\" verses edited version \"Gee, you thought I was going to go in and spit on him\". Then the tobacco shop scene: Bette says: \"How about a blow job\" and then the edited version: \"How about a party\". Also several scenes cut from the edited version: Bette with Peter Coyote having sex in a chair, seen from behind the chair. The scene at the police station where Bette tells the cop needle dick, pencil dick, ect. when she is trying to make him get the picture. My point is that for some reason this edited version is the only one you can get on tape now. I bought one from Hastings music store and it was this edited version- 99-100 minutes version. Don't know why you can't get the original unedited version of this movie, my favourite comedy of all times.",
         "This film is a pretty good example of turning the \"buddy\" movie into a film about two women who discover a common friendship. Shelley Long is a woman who has spent years studying for a stage acting career. As pointed out in another review on this thread, her character her is like \"Diane Chambers\" in CHEERS, except that Long is not lording her superior education over everyone. She does make one exception. She is trying to get into a course led by one of the great actors of this generation (Robert Prosky, in a clever role - he uses several accents), who is a Russian stage star - a \"Stanislavsky\" type. Prosky is quite selective about who comes in. He chooses Long because of her impressive resume. But he also allows in Bette Midler, who is ... well a hooker. Bette wants to better herself, and she'd like to be an actress. But she doesn't have the background or the money (Long has to borrow it from her parents). She gets in (it is more than hinted she sold some of her wares to Prosky). He looks amused as he decides to include her in the course. He is an intensive acting genius, and we see him demonstrate how to be realistic in many details (such as dying on stage). He is also insisting that they all take good notes, but leave their notebooks with him to be returned the following week. A hard taskmaster, he probably does know much about acting. In the meantime both Long and Midler meet Peter Coyote, and he is dating both without knowing of each other's connection. This is good, as Long and Midler dislike each other (Long looking down on this pretentious hooker, Midler hating this overbearing overachiever). Then, one day, Long is accompanying Coyote out for dinner. He enters a shop, and it suddenly explodes. Long (in deep mourning) goes to the morgue. Shortly Midler shows up, and after a brief screaming fit between them, they discover that the corpse simply can't be Coyote - it's lacking a certain piece of evidence that it is. Midler and Long decide to join forces to find out what happened to Coyote. They can't find any assistance from the police (who have an open and shut accidental death). But soon they are being pursued by Federal agents led by John Schuck. They manage to shake him off, and slowly follow the few clues they find to realize they have to cross the country to follow their lover...and to force him to choose between them. Eventually they do find Coyote, only to find another less pleasant side to him. And they find that half the world seems to be pursuing them as well. The film has great moments in it, such as Long using Prosky's training to fool some people, and Long and Midler playing Eastern Europeans trying to board a plane (the right plane) at an airport. Then there is George Carlin, who plays an American Indian with the attitudes of...well George Carlin, God bless him. The film is also interesting as Long and Midler, once their cooperation grows and they find what Coyote is like, discover that they really like each other more than they thought. Look at several scenes after the middle of the film where the ladies start helping each other with grooming tips. I suggest that this film, with THELMA AND LOUIS, finally cemented the idea that a \"buddy\" film did not need two men to be the \"buddies\". And both films showed that such lady \"buddy\" films could be great entertainment.",
         "I loved this movie. Bette Midler and Shelly Long were the best female team-up's since Laverne & Shirley. I have seen this movie over and over again and I laugh like a fool every single time.",
         "Two completely different dames fall for the same guy. Bette Midler and Shelly Long make a wonderful dynamic duo. The problem with the film is that once the total plot is revealed, the movie goes downhill in quality and becomes one with full chase scenes. The quality here is that these totally different women could possibly bond together. Of course, given the situation that confronts them, bonding would be a way of survival. Robert Prosky was quite funny as the acting teacher, who is really a KGB agent. Peter Coyote has his moments as the false elementary schoolteacher up to his neck in espionage as a double agent. Fun, but then it becomes increasingly inane.",
         "By the end of the 80's they were churning out countless male buddy pics, so why not a female one? This one features Midler when she used to make funny big budget movies and Long when she used to make movies period. Just like any buddy film, the two hate each other on first sight, Midler the foul-mouthed antagonist and Long as the goody two-shoes. Things are set in motion when the two discover they were \"boffing\" the same man (Coyote) and decide to find him when they realize his death was staged. They set out on an oddyssey across several states and end up fighting for their lives when he shows us he's not only a spy but somewhat psychotic! There's a great, if contrived, climax set atop skinny vertical rocks that are about 10 feet apart and 100 feet off the ground. But what you look for in these types of movies you find, well-written bickering that should make you giggle plenty of times. Though guys should look out, with this written by a woman, there's a large dose of on target man bashing. Pretty much Long and Midlers last best comedy offering.",
         "After that lame sitcom, I had given up on Bette Midler. Amazingly, this film still stands up to this day. When I recently watched it again I was surprised - just as funny as when I was eight, except now I get some more of the jokes. A buddy flick with chicks, and laugh out loud funny. If you haven't seen it, get it out some tuesday night, load up on junk food, enjoy. Pair with Ruthless People for the definitive Bette double bill.",
         "I loved this movie very much in its original unedited version. For some reason I cannot find this version any more. I bought a brand new sealed copy of it from a video store and it was the edited for T.V. version 99-100 minutes. The original unedited version would be a little longer because they cut out several scenes besides the editing of the various adult humor. Would love it very much if someone could hook me up with an original unedited version of this movie. Thanks!",
         "Bette Midler and Shelley Long... make one of the best female pairs ever! They are an absolute scream! It would be wonderful if we were to see them in another film together. This movie is one of the best under-rated comedies I have ever seen! Funny action/mystery plot is very winning that packs both power and energy. A must see for anyone that loves a good comedy... however... is on the adult side of things.... U will laugh your ass off!"
