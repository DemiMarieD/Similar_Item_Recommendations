What this film does so well is put a human cultural face behind the grim statistics of the Holocaust. By showing us the rich musical legacy that was virtually destroyed by the Nazi death machine, one is able to more firmly grasp just how horrific the Holocaust was. The music is beautiful, and the focus of the documentary, Leopold Kozlowski, is a lively charismatic man and keeps this film entertaining to watch."],
