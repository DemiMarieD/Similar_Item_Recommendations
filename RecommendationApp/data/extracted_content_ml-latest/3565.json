      "synopsis": "Seventeen-year-old, seven-months-pregnant Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman) sets off on a road trip from Tennessee to California with her ignorant, ne'er-do-well boyfriend, Willy Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno). In Sequoyah, Oklahoma, Novalee asks Willy to stop at a Wal-Mart so that she can use the bathroom and replace her shoes, which had fallen out the bottom of their beat-up car. When Novalee reaches out for her change at the checkout, the sum of $5.55 sends her into a panic, as she believes that the number 5 is a bad omen, as when she was 5, her mother left her for a baseball umpire; and when she was waitressing, a customer went berzerk and cut her arm from wrist to elbow, and it took 55 stitches to close the wound. She runs outside to discover that Willy has taken off without her. For the rest of the afternoon, Novalee browses Wal-Mart, where she meets Sister Husband (Stockard Channing), who runs the Welcome Wagon in town. Sister Husband mistakenly believes Novalee to be her long-lost relative Ruth Ann, and she gives her a buckeye tree and a welcome basket. Novalee also meets photographer Moses Whitecotton (Keith David) who later becomes her mentor. That evening, Novalee feels unwell and runs into the bathroom to vomit. When she comes out again, she discovers that the store is closed, locked, and dark. She soon figures out how to live undetected in the Wal-Mart. Novalee visits the town library and meets Forney Hull (James Frain), who works there while caring for his sister \"the librarian\", an alcoholic. Novalee learns from Sister Husband that Forney was attending Bowdoin College in Maine, where he was studying to be a history teacher before he had to leave school to care for his sister. Novalee goes to Sister Husband's house and explains that she is not Ruth Ann. Nonetheless, Sister Husband invites her in for cornbread and buttermilk, and Novalee plants the buckeye tree in Sister's yard. Back in the Wal-Mart, Novalee wakes up during a thunderstorm when she starts feeling pain in her abdomen. Her water breaks, and while attempting to mop it up, she goes into labor. As she collapses, she notices that she is in Aisle 5, so she makes a big effort to move to the next aisle. At this moment, Forney (who saw her go into the store at closing time) jumps through a plate-glass window and helps deliver her baby. The next morning, Novalee wakes up in the hospital, where she learns she has become a minor celebrity for giving birth in a Wal-Mart. After being asked by her nurse, Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd) what she will name her baby, Novalee replies Americus, following Moses's advice to name her a strong name. Novalee gets to know Lexie, who reveals that she has had four children by three different men, all named after snacks: Brownie, Praline, Cherry, and Baby Ruth. While in the hospital, Novalee gets a visit from her mother (Sally Field), whom she has not seen since she was a child. Her mother asks if she has a place to live. Novalee says no, and her mother says that pooling their cash, they can get an apartment together. She hands over all her money, $500, to her mother, who promises to pick her and Americus up at 9:00 a.m. the next day. At 12:15 p.m. Novalee is still waiting, and realizes that her mother took her money, leaving her destitute and homeless. Just then, Sister Husband comes by and invites Novalee and the baby to live at her house, as \"she does not know how to take care of the buckeye tree\". Meanwhile Willy Jack is in prison but trying to make it as a country singer, after being arrested for dating a young teenager who robbed a 7-11, and hired by music agent Ruth Meyers (Joan Cusack). Back at Sister Husband's house, an evangelical couple from Midnight, Mississippi come to \"show the Wal-Mart Baby the word of God\", but Sister Husband slams the door on them. Novalee and Forney are getting Christmas trees when Forney recalls that Americus is five months old, sending Novalee into a panic about her unlucky number and racing home to find out that Americus has been kidnapped. Sister Husband tells a police officer about the church folks that came to her house from Midnight, Mississippi. Novalee recalls that while in the hospital, she was reading cards that people sent her, and that one from Midnight, Mississippi said her baby was an abomination to the Lord. They follow the police cars to the outside of a church, where they find Americus in Baby Jesus's manger. Five years later, Novalee has begun a career as a photographer with the help of Moses Whitecotton. One day a tornado blows through the town. Novalee and Americus hide in an underground shelter, but Sister is out running an errand and does not make it back in time. Sister Husband is killed and their home is destroyed. After the funeral, one of Sister Husband's friends informs Novalee that she is the beneficiary of Sister's estate, worth around $41,000, which Novalee uses to build a new home for herself and Americus on Sister's land. One day, Novalee receives a call from Brownie, Lexie's eldest child. Novalee cannot hear what he is saying, but eventually perceives that something bad has happened. She goes over to Lexie's house, where she finds Lexie, Brownie, and Praline covered in blood and bruised. Novalee invites Lexie and her now five children to live with her and Americus in their new house. Lexie tells Novalee that her new boyfriend had tried to molest her two oldest children, Brownie and Praline, when Praline threw up on him, whereupon Lexie returned home from work early and caught him before he got to Brownie. Lexie attacked him, hitting him twice before he knocked her out. Lexie is at first devastated, but as time passes she and her children begin to heal, and she eventually marries the ordinary yet reliable Ernie the Exterminator and has another child. When Forney's sister passes away due to alcoholism and he does not show up at the funeral, Novalee finds him in a hotel and comforts him. They end up sleeping together, after which he tells her that he loves her; she doesn't reply. Forney returns to Maine to bury his sister, and the townspeople remark on how he can finally leave town and have a life. When he comes back, he talks about visiting Bowdoin, and Novalee realizes that he can now finish his education. Forney tells Novalee he loves her and wants to stay with her, but Novalee lies, saying she does not love him, and he leaves. On Americus's 5th birthday, Novalee is paranoid about her party because of unlucky five: When Americus was five days old, she had jaundice; at five weeks old, she had an ear infection; at five months old, she was kidnapped). Meanwhile, Novalee picks up a newspaper and reads about a double amputee being robbed of his wheelchair. The amputee proves to be Willy Jack, who lost his legs when he got drunk after being sued for copyright infringement for his hit song. While drunk, he kept hearing Novalee's voice talking about Americus; then he tripped on train tracks and was hit by an oncoming train. During his singing career, he just missed running into Novalee when he entered an elevator with his agent just moments after Novalee exited the other elevator on her way to accepting an award for a photograph. Novalee visits Willy in the hospital and tells him about her life. He admits that he lied to her when he told her that he didn't feel the baby's heart beat the day he left her. He says he wishes he could go back and undo the lie, because a single lie can change your whole life. He explains that people lie because they're \"scared, crazy, or just mean\". Novalee realizes that she made a similar mistake lying to Forney. She drives Willy Jack home to Tennessee and then continues on to Maine to find Forney. Novalee admits to him that she lied and that she really loves him, and they return to Oklahoma to get married in a Wal-Mart.",

         "This is one of those movies where you feel \"all is right with the world\" when it's over. It is inspirational - in the midst of the violence and profanity that occurs in life, it reminds you that there are still good, honest and decent people. I admire the fact that a wonderful movie was created without nudity, very little violence or excess profanity (were there 4-letter words in the movie?). I admit, it's somewhat of a fantasy that good things happen only to good people and bad things to bad people - but it makes you feel good about the outcome all the same.",
         "Where the Heart Is is a special kind of movie. City of Angels, Message in a Bottle, and Where the Heart Is all have that special ingredient that just grabs the viewer and holds him or her until the very last tear flows from their eye. Natalie Portman is very well cast in her role as Novalee Nation, a 20 year old pregnant woman who decides to move to California with her boyfriend. The sad thing is, when her and her boyfriend stop at a Wal-Mart in the middle of Oklahoma, he leaves her behind, and moves on without her. The movie follows her life after she realizes that her boyfriend has left her stranded, and is not coming back. A very unique screenplay allows this movie to radiate a love for Novalee, and allows the viewers to develop a friendship with her. Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd) becomes Novalee's best friend when they meet in the hospital after Novalee has her baby. Where the Heart Is has everything it takes to be a great movie. The choice of actors is superb, and the direction is wonderful. Of course with every movie made, at least all that I have viewed, there was a few things wrong with the movie. For instance, Novalee's mother abandoned her when she was about 8 years old. Right after she gives birth to her baby, her mother shows up by her side, and quite frankly, nothing ever becomes of that scene. It's completely irrelevant. Also, there is the whole living in Wal-Mart for six weeks thing to consider. I mean can that really happen? At any rate, by no means should these `mistakes' thwart your intention of watching this movie, it a real tearjerker, and I believe the best date movie since For Love of the Game.",
         "It is not that a movie such as \"Where The Heart Is\" comes along and makes an impression so huge that you don't want to see it end. This is exactly what happened to me when I sat down to watch \"Where The Heart Is.\" Within the first few moments of the film, I knew it would be special; this reason is Natalie Portman. Portman has a unique look of innocence that cannot be pulled off by many actresses as she does with her character, Novalee Nation. I couldn't wait for the next scene she would be in because of the physical beauty she possesses and the beauty in the performance she gives. Complimenting the performance of Portman is that of Ashley Judd. As I was watching Judd and Portman, I could tell that these are two actresses who knew exactly what the other would say and do the moment before it was actually done. Ashley Judd lights up the screen every SINGLE time she arrives in a scene. It is a no wonder she is the best at what she does. Another reason I liked \"Where The Heart Is\" relates to the double story lines of Portman's character determined to raise her daughter by herself while trying to make a career in photography. The other storyline revolved around the ex-boyfriend trying to make a name for himself in country music. The cool thing is that these are hobbies of mine and whenever I saw a camera or heard country music it brought a smile to my face. Not only are these hobbies of mine but they are both testaments to what can be done if one works hard enough to attain a specific goal. The story is one that will take you on a journey through the depths of your heart, soul, and end up in your head relaying the message that \"Where The Heart Is\" is a phenomenal movie. \"Where The Heart Is\" is not only my favorite film but the best film of 2000. GO SEE THIS WONDERFUL WORK OF ART.",
         "A young pregnant girl (Natalie Portman) gets left in a small Oklahoma town by her loser boyfriend (Dylan Bruno) on their way to California from Tennessee. Portman is literally stranded at the local Wal-Mart and then becomes a national celebrity when she gives birth late one night at the store. Local gardener Stockard Channing and her live-in lover (Richard Jones) take the youngster and her child in as Portman gets the opportunity to work for Wal-Mart. Immediately we are introduced to a whole host of vivid characters. There is nurse Ashley Judd who is rearing five young children of her own, department store photographer Keith David and shy librarian James Frain who is taking care of his alcoholic older sister (Margaret Ann Hoard). And we even get a short glimpse of Portman's trashy, money-hungry mother (an electrically-charged cameo for Sally Field). Time passes, and Portman experiences life, love, triumph, tragedy and everything in between as she makes the small Oklahoma town her own. Smart drama that never loses its way and stays interesting due to Portman's show-stopping performance. The rest of the cast is right on key as well as fellow \"Heat\" alum Judd does a deceptively deep and heartfelt job. The movie works due to a steady pace, strong direction and a totally under-appreciated script. 4 stars out of 5.",
         "I have to admit having a bias towards sci-fi, action adventure, mystery, conspiracy films, etc. I have sat through \"Steel Magnolias\" and \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" with my wife, and while I can admit they are well made movies, I have never been too keen on movies with an all-female or predominantly female cast. I have also never cared much for Sally Fields movies. Perhaps I always think of her from the \"Bandit\" movies... My first impression from all the trailers was that \"Where the Heart Is\" was noting more than another \"chick-flik\" that I would no doubt find well-produced, but forgettable. I was wrong. Natalie Portman registers a great performance as a meek and down-trodden pregnant teen who learns early in life that \"our lives can change with every breath.\" Ashley Judd puts in an Oscar worthy performance in her supporting role as the older, married friend who has trouble finding the right man to be the father of her children. Stockard Channing plays the unforgettable \"Sister Husband\" who takes the young girl and her newborn child in, and Sally Fields makes a momentary appearance as the young girl's absentee mother, one of the highlights in the film. Fields has deepened my respect for her as an actress with five minutes of film time like no other actor/actress has in a long time. Joan Cusack appears as a talent manager in the film's sub-plot and is phenomenal in her brief on screen time as well. Yes, there are men in the film, veteran David Keith among them, but for the most part, this film relies on the vision of the world through the eyes of it's female leads. I loved this film- the comedy, the drama, the love story... I laughed, and although I hate to admit it, being a tough guy and all, I cried- several times- during this wonderful film about learning to be content with what we have and learning to appreciate how unique and special everyone and everything is.",
         "A harmless little \"chick flick\"? Nothing more than an attempt by Natalie Portman to try anything before she's pigeon-holed in her Star Wars persona and can't get other roles because of it (a la Mark Hamill)? No, on both counts. Where the Heart Is will surely be labeled as a \"chick flick\", but the truth is that a good movie is a good movie, and a bad one a bad one, regardless of what its target demographic is. Where the Heart Is is nothing short of a very, very good film. The story is original and the acting and dialogue are outstanding. Natlie Portman may best be known as Queen Amidala, but she should be known as one of the best young actresses in the business. She simply shines in this movie. I recommend this film to everyone.",
         "i love this movie so much. I thought it was gonna be a funny but stupid film. but it was totally opposite of it. The movie was very sweet and touching. people say that it's a fantasy movie or it's a really fake movie. but forget whole walmart and #5 thing. this movie is about relationship between people and people get what they deserve!",
         "What can really be said about a movie that can alter your world in just a few short hours? I went into this movie not exactly expecting much, mainly there because the amazing and beautiful Natalie Portman was starring in it. What I soon saw was a harmonious blend of love, sadness, hardship, and every human emotion I can even imagine. The only thing that eclipses the intense emotions you feel in this movie are the performances turned out by a perfectly assembled group of some of the finest actors out there. Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Stockard Channing, Joan Cusack, just to name a few. The only thing that should be keeping you from seeing this movie is...well, I can't even think of an excuse that should be keeping you from seeing this heart-warming and enchanting story. This movie has changed my life, as I am sure it will any others who are fortunate enough to view it.",
         "This film is a bittersweet human-interest story with a side order of romance. The story has a country flavor, plenty of country music and a story that could serve as the film version of the typical lyrics of any country music CD. It is replete with bad decisions, bad luck and tragedies at every turn. It is sappy, corny, stereotypical, and unfortunately full of the types of things that really happen in rural America. Despite this seething despondency, it has an upbeat fatalism that suggests that at least for some of the people, the struggle against bad breaks and hard times pays off. The story follows the life of Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), poor young girl setting out to start a new life with her no account boyfriend. When Novalee makes a rest stop at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma, he ditches her, literally leaving her there barefoot and pregnant. Having only five dollars to her name, she takes up residence in the Wal-Mart and ultimately has the baby there. She becomes a minor celebrity and she is adopted by the Welcome Wagon lady. The remainder of the film examines the various relationships and experiences she has in this small town over the next seven or eight years. The story is charming and steeped in sentiment. The character development of Novalee is excellent, although Director Matt Williams could have spent more time on some of the supporting characters, especially Sister Husband (Stockard Channing). To his credit, the film was nicely shot, and the tornado scene was fabulous. Natalie Portman's performance was her best to date. She played the part with a near helpless determination that made her a very attractive and lovable character. Her southern accent was terrible, but her portrayal of the rural southern attitude was on target. Though the part didn't have a lot of range, she was extremely effective with the emotional element, and elicited great sympathy and admiration for her response to her desperate situation. Stockard Channing was wonderful as the eccentric Welcome Wagon lady. I would have liked to see this part expanded, just to see more of Channing. She was enchantingly warm and peculiar. James Frain was also very good as Forney. He made the character very interesting and affable. He continues to be a solid supporting actor who has shown himself to be extremely versatile (Hilary and Jackie, Reindeer Games, Titus). Ashley Judd added another fine performance to her resume, with a free spirited portrayal of Lexie. This was a nice story with an agreeable and upbeat ending. I rated it a 7/10. Add a point if you are a woman or if you have ever lived in a mobile home. It will find its most enthusiastic audience with women due to its extreme sentimentality, but it is not so `female' that it can't be enjoyed by men, making it a good date movie.",
         "For the first 1:15 or so, I was really enjoying this sweet and funny movie about a young girl (Novalee, played by Natalie Portman) dealing with being pregnant and unmarried, who is abandoned by her boyfriend (Dylan Bruno) and takes up residence (unknown to anyone) in a local Wal-Mart. After giving birth to the baby in the store, she is swindled and abandoned by her mother (Sally Field) but survives and flourishes thanks to the kindness of some rather eccentric strangers. So far, so good. Very enjoyable. But the last 45 minutes or so really unravelled rather quickly. I questioned the need to continually bring us back to Willie Jack's (the baby's father) attempts to get a singing career going. None of his scenes really served to advance the plot in any way, and quite frankly, the guy was a loser who abandoned his pregnant girlfriend. I didn't care what happened to him - even though some of what happened was poetic justice - and the movie could have been shortened by 20 or 30 minutes - without losing a thing - if all his scenes had been simply cut. I also felt that it was totally unnecessary to include (albeit - thankfully - only for a few minutes) a theme about child molestation. Where did that come from and why? It made a relatively enjoyable movie very heavy, and it was a heaviness that - for me at least - never really disappeared. The end of the movie (revolving around the relationship between Novalee and Forney (James Frain) was also telegraphed quite early on. Having made those criticisms, the real highlight of the movie for me was Natalie Portman as Novalee. I wasn't familiar with this young actress until now, but she was marvellously cast as the sweet, innocent, naive young Novalee, and then showed a wonderful capacity to show her character evolve into a mature and independent young woman. (I have to say that, while the movie seemed to be trying to say she was a great mother, she seemed to spend a lot of time away from little Americus, but that's a minor point.) Portman was excellent, and I will look forward to seeing her again. This rates a 6/10. Would have been higher, except for the weak second half."

         "Novalee Nation is a pregnant 17-year-old from Tennessee heading to California with her boyfriend Willie Jack, but is abandoned by him at a Wal-Mart store in Sequoyah, Oklahoma. Novalee has no job, no skills and only $5.55 in her pocket, so she secretly lives in the Wal-Mart until her daughter Americus is born six weeks later. Novalee decides to raise her daughter and rebuild her life in Sequoyah, with the help of eccentric but kind strangers. Based on the best-selling novel by Billie Letts.",
         "Having lived her entire life in a trailer, Novalee Nation is a pregnant, superstitious and uneducated seventeen year old. With the exception of her boyfriend and the unborn baby's father Willie Jack Pickens, she is all alone in the world with no money of her own. On the drive from their current home in Tennessee to Bakersfield, California where they are planning on moving, Willie Jack abandons Novalee in the small town of Sequoyah, Oklahoma. With no food or money, Novalee ends up secretly living in the town's Wal-Mart. As her stay in Sequoyah is extended, Novalee is befriended and ultimately assisted by a variety of townsfolk, including a recovering alcoholic named Sister Husband, single mother and nurse Lexi Coop who names her children after snack foods, WalMart's contract photographer named Moses Whitecotten, and the temporary librarian named Forney Hull, an academically brilliant man originally from New England. As much as they help Novalee, she in turn has a profound affect on them as each is dealing with an issue which stops them from having a truly fulfilled life. Forney ends up falling in love with Novalee, who feels she has to make a decision of how she can best help him. She is assisted in this decision by an unlikely source.",
         "A pregnant teen goes on the road with her dreamer boy friend, who abandons her in a Wal-Mart store in Oklahoma. Left alone with virtually no money, she hides out in the store for 6 weeks until her baby is born. After the birth, she gets national recognition as giving birth to the \"Wal-mart baby\". She makes friends with two local women (Stockard Channing as a religious, but promiscious woman & Ashley Judd as a woman with a pile of kids, who also seems to have considerable man problems until she marries the local exterminator). She also becomes friends with the Wal-mart photographer, who leads her to a career, and with a young man who runs the library and takes her of his alcoholic sister, who is the real librarian.",
         "Novalee Nation, 17 and very pregnant, has never been part of a real home. The closest thing to family for the hard-luck teen is her selfish, would-be musician boyfriend, Willy Jack, with whom she's traveling from Tennessee to California in a rust bucket that used to be a Plymouth. A bathroom stop en route, at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart, changes Novalee's life forever. For when she leaves the store, she discovers that Willy Jack and the Plymouth are gone. Only her Polaroid camera remains in the parking space. Alone and broke, Novalee surreptitiously moves into the vast store, borrowing food and supplies from its shelves. When she gives birth on the floor - and her hideaway is revealed - Novalee and her \"Wal-Mart Baby\" become instant celebrities. More importantly, over the next few years, Novalee finally becomes part of an unconventional, makeshift family comprised of her wonderfully eccentric new friends. Now, with the family she always wanted, Novalee is transformed from a homeless teen to a successful and strong woman. She has finally found a home in this small town where fate has dropped her.",
