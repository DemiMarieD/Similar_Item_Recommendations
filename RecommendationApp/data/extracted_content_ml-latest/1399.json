         "This film took this jaded, tough-to-manipulate moviegoer and reduced him to a blubbering mass of water. Instead of the usual over-the-top death scene, the film finds a clever, non-contrived way to end by leaving these characters at a magical moment of mutual understanding. It is one of the most powerful endings I've ever seen in a film, and believe me, I've seen thousands. What I found most remarkable about it was how the film reveals--despite the sisters' major character differences--how similar they really are. Both abandon one part of their family to sacrifice for another part--they each merely take different parts, and that's why Lee's character is not as bad, selfish or one-dimensional as she first seems. Lee's problem was understanding love. Despite all her lovers, Lee (Streep) had to learn the real meaning of love from her spinster sister Bessie (Keaton). The film is full of irony. One such moment is when Lee, rather tactlessly, says to Bessie that she finally feels as though her life has begun. To which Bessie, who is surely about to die, can only sigh. The greatest irony, of course, is that Lee finds herself at the same juncture she was 20 years prior. Will she choose to sacrifice to care for her sister, just as her sister had chosen to do with her father and aunt? Bessie, in contrast, had come to find that she hadn't \"thrown it all away\" to care for sick relatives. What first seemed a sacrifice had become transformed, through her own experience, into another valid way of experiencing life. To Lee's perspective, the elders where millstones, hindrances, inconveniences robbed of their humanity--almost the antithesis of life. Yet, behind the eccentricities of Aunt Ruth (Verdon) and other-worldly silence of her chronically ill father Marvin (Cronyn), she had found, and reveled in, their uniquness, their humanness. Making Lee's two sons very different also added complexity and depth to the film. It's obvious that Hank (DiCaprio) is his mother's son, it's just that his mother doesn't realize it. Hank too is at a crucial moment of choice: Will he abandon his selfishness, or will he abandon his familial and moral obligation to help Bessie? And what accounts for the polar opposite behavior of the younger son Charlie (Scardino)? The movie doesn't give an answer. Genetics, environment, relationships and all the other things that make us who we are are complex things. The scriptwriter is smart enough to realize that. Touches of humor keep this from becoming an oppressive Bergmanesque angst-fest, and its patient character development steers it out of obvious soapy (ie. \"Terms of Endearment\") territory. Although the thing has a sort of TV-movie aesthetic in the staging and the scoring, the writing and acting are everything you'd want. Beautiful.",
         "It's such a wonderful story, not at all as dreary as one would expect. The late Scott McPherson injected so much humor and heart into this film, it's hard not to just go along with it. Diane Keaton got the Oscar nomination, but Meryl Streep's character drives the film, as she works her way back into a family she turned her back on so she could have a life of her own. She was right to do so, as her sister (Keaton) has become consumed with caregiving for her father and aunt, taking absolutely no time out for herself. The film also features a nice departure for Robert De Niro from his typically heavy roles. That alone is worth seeing, and fans of his typical performances should be forced to watch this. This quiet film may not have enough action for some, but it is far better than most films dealing with serious illness. The journey these sisters begin is something that has been explored in countless TV movies (think Lifetime), but what separates it is the humor and the character development that makes the viewer wish he/she could stay and watch the family long after the film ends. The film also benefits from the presence of Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives an unlikely nuanced performance as the older son who develops some character and helps his flighty mother grow along with him. The great thing about his presence in the film is that younger viewers (mostly female, probably) will be more likely to see this movie and get something out of it in the process. Finally, a word about Gwen Verdon and Hume Cronyn. Their contributions to this film are immeasurable. And as already mentioned, it's great that younger viewers can watch this film and get a last look at them in these touching roles and see how charm never fades with age. Cronyn has little to do but lie ill in bed, yet somehow his character remains a focal point. And Verdon's comic relief pairing with the younger son is a real highlight. She also manages a poignant moment or two in a her scenes with Keaton. This truly is an ensemble piece, and it wouldn't have been without their talent. Why I don't yet own a copy of this sweet film is a mystery.",
         "This movie should be reviewed for its great performances from some of the best actors today. Meryl Streep does not fail to shine out as one of the best actresses of all time as an emotionally distraught mother in this tale of hopes, emotions and intense feelings. Keaton, on the other hand portrays her best performance ever, and Leonardo DiCaprio proves that he has talents besides being a heartthrob. This movie really moved me, not because of the story itself but the acting was very realistic....I believe that they all should have received an Oscar nomination. Well done!",
         "Marvin's Room (1996) Dir: Jerry Zaks Finally a movie of substance that harkens back to Keaton's earlier successes. Keaton co-stars with drama heavyweight Meryl Streep as two estranged sisters who reunite to deal with Keaton's recently diagnosed leukemia. Keaton's character is hopeful that Streep or one of her two screen sons can be a bone marrow donor for her and thereby possibly save her life. Meanwhile, Keaton has been caring for the sister's long suffering and long dying father, Marvin (Hume Croyn). Adding a little box office punch to the flick is current heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio as one of Streep's \"problem\" boys. Though the plot reads like melodrama, and to an extent it is, the movie is fairly subtle and unexpected in its story line choices. If nothing else, one doesn't have the feeling that the writers wrote the screenplay over beers and an episode of Married with Children. Nominated for Best Actress, Keaton gets to present a more controlled and quiet persona than she usually displays. Streep is typically fine as a used to be good time girl who finally is about to graduate out of beauty school and is having trouble dealing with her sick sister, her dying father and her whacked-out teen son. Definitely worth a view if for no other reason than to fill in the missing Keaton and/or Streep movies you may have missed. And gosh, doesn't Leo look cute!",
         "This film was on the end of Eraser that I taped off Sky Premier, it was purely accidental that I watched it. I started to watch it thinking that it might get me to sleep, but then I found it great. Robert De Niro had all the best lines with his pathetic brother, Bob(Dan Hedaya). Meryl Streep also shone in her screen time with her son, Hank(Leonardo Di Caprio in his best role ever). I loved the whole dramatic sequences, and found the acting touching and Oscar worthy. Diane Keaton provided all the tears in the film, with the others all providing laughs. This film was a huge surprise. I don't usually like dramas(although I loved Di Caprio's and De Niro's other film together, This Boy's Life), and I recommend this to everyone who loves good dramas. Rating=4/5",
         "This stage to screen adaptation about two estranged sisters attempting a reconciliation after one is diagnosed with cancer is sentimental to the extreme, manipulative beyond forgiveness.....and had me close to blubbering like a baby by the time it was over. Chalk it up to the fact that I had recently lost a grandmother to cancer, but this film nearly devastated me even as I was mad that it was so maudlin. The fact that it works as well as it does is due largely to the fact that such good actors are cast in it. Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton play the sisters (Keaton is the ill one), and while it would never have occurred to me to put these two actresses together, the decision was inspired. And right before he rocketed to international fame, Leonardo DiCaprio does strong work as Keaton's troubled nephew. I won't even try to defend this film against those who say it's too schmaltzy to bear, but please let the rest of us enjoy it in blubbery peace. Grade: A-",
         "We were raised under the lie that families are and should be the epitome of perfection. Ozzie and Harriet. The Bradys. The Nelsons. However we all know that this is never the case and more often than not a trivial incident is the dividing moment where siblings decide to go their separate ways, and this is the case here: two sisters have been estranged for about twenty years. Bessie has stayed with her parents and has taken care of them while Lee has pursued her own interests with a marked selfishness that hides an inability to cope with familial duty and in the interim she has raised two boys of her own. Now, father Marvin is ill with senile dementia and can barely muster words. Bessie has been diagnosed with leukemia and her chances of survival depends on a bone marrow transplant and only her estranged family can give her that. And on top of this, Lee is having her own trouble with her oldest son: Hank just burned their house down and landed in a mental institution, so the thought of traveling down to Florida to visit Bessie seems less than welcome and more than an inconvenience. Bessie and Lee's reunion is appropriately awkward and filled with tension that is simmering under the surface, ready to explode at any time. Like enemies they circle around each other throwing their personalities at each other and there is a confrontation scene that is inevitable but doesn't quite resolve anything. I was reminded of Ingmar Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS, in which two sisters and a maid were taking care of their third sister who was dying, each of them with their own baggage of self-hatred and inability to love and be open. Jerry Zaks' film is not that deep or stylized nor does it intend to be. His is an honest, straightforward examination on Scott McPherson's stage play about the shadow of death lingering over one family and occasionally lapses into humor with its supporting characters. That works well, because to make this a heavy-handed meditation of death, especially when three of its characters are on the brink of it, would be asking too much for its audience. Only its implied nature is seen here but its effect is no less devastating, even if glimmers of hope seep through the fabric of this family and makes its bond tighter. Being a slice of life story, characters are on center stage at all times so they must be defined through their tempers. Lee is quite a shrill woman who throughout her stay at her parents' seems on the brink of just grabbing her things and driving as fast as she could and could be a version of any of the healthy sisters in the Bergman film. Meryl Streep takes on the role against her ethereal type and uses her body language and strong voice to convey a loud woman who needs so much reassurance that she can't see a little thing as family getting in the way. On the other hand, Bessie is closer to the maid's character in CRIES AND WHISPERS, and Diane Keaton's portrayal is quiet, thoughtful, and on rare occasions only hinting at her own terror as her illness progresses. The third actor who reveals himself here is Leonardo diCaprio. He plays the troubled son Hank and his interactions are mainly with both sisters. Watch his body language with both: whenever he's with Lee he's angry and borderline threatening. I get the hint that even when the credits are over, they will always have a brittle relationship, and this is due to Lee's own selfishness. Meanwhile, Hank and Bessie break the ice and in one touching scene share a drive on the beach. Their childlike laughter speaks volumes of what their relationship would have been had there never been an estrangement. Leonardo DiCaprio tackles the role with intensity and urgency and there are a couple of moments when I thought he might resemble James Dean without the pout but the sheer anger. MARVIN'S ROOM doesn't try to give simple answers; after all, all families have dysnfunctions, but instead is like a canvas that reveals itself for the many layers of dynamics between its players and does so in an uplifting manner, much like the beautiful moment when Bessie and Lee witness Marvin's delight in seeing a display of light coming from a mirror Bessie is holding. It's a quiet moment, one of intense love, that shows the power of family despite the odds, and what better way to end the film with Gwen Verdon's last line? Hope is all around.",
         "Scott McPherson adapts a beautiful screenplay from his own play. 'Marvin's Room' could have easily been just another one of those sentimental disease-of-the-weak type TV films but McPherson stays true to the story injecting it with a delightful dose of humour. The film focuses on broken relationships and how it's never too late to take the step to mend them until you're gone. The execution is simple and that works very well. The score is in sync with the flow. The writing is beautiful. The dialogues are cleverly written. Diane Keaton is marvelous in a role that could have easily turned out to be a cliché if it were played by a lesser actress. She plays her part naturally with a quiet and yet layered restraint. Meryl Streep does a fine job as the slightly more rebellious and estranged sister who had escaped from having to take care of her father and is proud of her diploma. Leonardo Dicaprio isn't bad either. Robert De Niro is great in a more laidback role. He also reveals a flare for comedy. His scenes with a splendid Dan Hedaya had me laughing. Gwen Verdon is a delight and she provides excellent comic relief. Hume Cronyn doesn't have a scene out of bed but he definitely makes the viewer take note of his performance. My favourite scene is towards the end when the two sisters chat in the kitchen. Keaton's Bessie may have been 'consumed' by taking care of her ailing father and aunt, not 'leading' her own life like the typical American woman but the amazing thing is that she doesn't regret it because she is proud that she has given them so much love and that she can do the same now with her sister and nephews. Then there's the ending which is superbly done. You're left wanting to know how these wonderful characters are doing but at the same time one can acknowledge that it's the best way to end.",
         "I happen to rank this movie as one of Leo's finest. It is definitely not as main-stream as his others, but the content and the acting was brilliant. I am a sucker for movies about dysfunctional families and this one takes the cake. It was so human...there was nothing \"Hollywood\" about this at all. Each character has their own emotional turmoil and when Lee comes down with Hank and Charlie, the characters are forced to come to terms with it. Leo delivered a stand-out performance in a cast of film legends. Meryl Streep is also wonderful as Lee, the self-centered mom who left her family behind in search of her own dreams.",
         "MARVIN'S ROOM is a character-driven drama based on the Scott McPherson play. Director Jerry Zaks manages to get the best from an all-star cast. Bessie(Diane Keaton)is a care-giving soul that discovers she has her own health dilemma. Bessie takes care of her bedridden father Marvin(Hume Cronyn), who always seems to be nicely dressed right down to his bow tie. Marvin has retired himself to his room. Aunt Ruth(Gwen Verdon)is a handful that is not too damn close reality. She likes to wear a garage door remote around her waist and insists on huge hugs. Bessie is told by her own physician (Robert De Niro)that she has leukemia and needs bone marrow. She is forced to contact her sister Lee(Meryl Streep)with whom she has had a 20-year old feud. Lee, a beautician, seems to be only interested in supporting herself and two sons. Ten-year old Charlie(Hal Scandino)does well to stay sane by ignoring the drama that surrounds him. On the other hand 17 year-old Hank(Leonardo DiCaprio)is earthy and troubled after being institutionalized for burning down the house. There is a lot of emotional ground the two sisters must decide on to discard and what to forgive and forget. The characters are so well defined and its easy to understand where each is coming from. Isn't it great that life allows humor to be found in times of discouragement and ill-fortune."

         "Estranged since their father's first stroke some 17 years earlier, Lee and Bessie lead separate lives in separate states. Lee's son, Hank, finds himself committed to a mental institution after setting fire to his mother's house. His younger brother, Charlie, seems unfazed by his brother's eccentricities or his mother's seeming disinterest. When Lee comes to the asylum to spring Hank for a week in Florida so that he can be tested as a possible bone marrow donor for Bessie, Hank is incredulous. \"I didn't even know you had a sister,\" he says. \"Remember, every Christmas, when I used to say 'Well, looks like Aunt Bessie didn't send us a card again this year?'\" \"Oh yeah,\" Hank says. Meanwhile, Marvin, the two women's bedridden father, has \"been dying for the past twenty years.\" \"He's doing it real slow so I don't miss anything,\" Bessie tells Dr. Wally. In Bessie's regular doctor's absence, it has fallen to Dr. Wally to inform Bessie that she has leukemia and will die without a bone marrow transplant. This precipitates the two sisters uneasy reunion. In Marvin's room, Bessie cares for her father's every need. In Lee's eyes, the sacrifice Bessie has made is too great and realizing the old man's welfare will fall to her if Bessie dies, Lee's first instinct is to look for a nursing home. \"In a few month's, I'll have my cosmotology degree,\" she says. \"My life is just coming together; I'm not going to give it all up, now!\" As first Lee is tested and then the boys for the compatibility of their marrow with Bessie's, the women take stock of their lives and rediscover the meaning of \"family.\"",
