         "I've seen this movie about 30 times and it always makes me feel good.. I don't know what it is about this movie but it seems to help me through bad times. Theres something in the atmosphere in the film that makes me feel good and the environment where the movie is made is just beautiful. (yeah, sure.. the 'real' film critics are saying that you can't rate a movie just on behalf of the spectacular scenery but FU, I say). I can rate a movie just the way i want to! Isn't that what IMDB is all about? I enjoyed this movie and I hope many others will too. Don't stare at the ratings. If you want to see a fun movie that's not too \"serious\". Rent this movie and let your brain rest for awhile, just enjoy the the scenery, the acting, the story and the eighties !! Cheers to all from Finland.",
         "Vibes entertains me immensely. While I can somewhat comprehend those who don't enjoy this movie, I don't share their attitude at all. Cyndi Lauper's lovelorn portrayal of Silvia is perfect in style and comic timing. She is utterly believable. She also pronounces Scandinavian and Incan sounds with flair. Peter Falk displays his usual mastery of comedy as the pathologically lying Harry, reminiscent of his role in The In-Laws (1979). He has the best and most absurd lines dealing with static electricity, a friend's infidelities with his former wives, his desire to be someone (someone with money), and how women are soft and might bounce out of a hotel, among many others. I like Jeff Goldblum in just about every movie he does, including this one, though here as Nick he seems a bit more distracted than usual. Still, that's a trait of many of his characters and is perhaps a component of his charm. Supporting players (Sands, Gress, Lerner, Bieri, &c.) all perform excellently, and the music is enchanting, particularly during the scenic settings in Ecuador. Although I've dubbed a fine DVD copy from a late-night movie channel, I'll buy a commercial release as soon as one's available. If I always wanted an intricate intellectual acting masterpiece with minimal music and scenery, I'd watch 12 Angry Men (1957) another dozen times, but Vibes is just the thing for light, fun fare.",
         "This is a lovely story of two psychics (Cyndi Lauper and Jeff Goldblum) being hired by Harry (Peter Falk) to look for his missing son, but later realize that he actually wants them to help him find a rumored \"room of gold\" in the deep mountains. In the end another team of searchers joins them to discover the greatest psychic energy in the world - the so-called room of treasure. The plot is adventurous, mysterious and hilarious. Lauper's performance is surprisingly stunning and funny, the scenery and the soundtrack are both beautiful, the movie is wonderfully shot in Ecuador and full of witty remarks. Whenever I feel a bit low I'll play the video for \"Vibes\" and then I'm full of joy again. I am well-entertained by this nice, interesting work. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.",
         "This is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, I know it's cheesy but thats what I loved about it and Peter Falk is hilarious. The way the three main characters play off each other is brilliant and who knew Cindi Lauper could act??? This movie was never going to win any awards and they all knew that before they started filming, Jeff Goldblum has always shown up in oddball movies ranging from Comedy to Drama To Sci-fi to Horror showing his range in acting. OK, no matter your opinion on this film the big Question is.... when will this movie be released on DVD? Has anyone heard any possible release date?",
         "I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released in 1988. I was 10 years old and my mom took me and my cousins to see it. It has been an absolute favorite of mine ever since. I used to have it on a VHS tape, recorded off of HBO or some other movie channel. That tape had been viewed sooooo many times it became degraded and was all fuzzy when I went to play it. I recently, after several years had gone by since I'd last seen it, began searching for a DVD copy. Much to my chagrin, I've learned it is not available on DVD (which I really want for the obvious reasons, plus, then it could be widescreen.) I finally bought a used copy of the full screen VHS tape. I still love it after all these years. In fact, my niece(age 10) and my nephew(age 11) just watched it with me tonight. They liked it as well. They thought it was very funny (but, not as funny as \"Transylvania 6-5000\" - which we watched on DVD last week). My nephew was particularly amused by Cyndi Lauper's acting - he thought she was great. This movie rocks and even goes beyond the generation gaps! I still consider it one of my favorite movies of all time!!!",
         "Cheerful, underrated comedy about psychics served as a showcase for pop singer Cyndi Lauper (in her acting debut). She's a comic natural playing Sylvia Pickel, an unlucky-in-love single gal whose \"psychic guide\" leads her into the arms of fellow clairvoyant Jeff Goldblum (in possibly his smoothest comic performance to date). Both have been duped by con-man Peter Falk into finding a lost city of gold in Ecuador, and for the most part \"Vibes\" is a funny, knockabout journey with witty vignettes scattered about. The last-act drags its feet, but the script is full of great exchanges and a wonderful scene on the dance floor between the two stars. Lots of amusing one-liners, such as my favorite from Goldblum after Elizabeth Peña disrobes: \"Parts of me are already applauding.\" *** out of ****",
         "This is a light hearted film featuring a knock out comedy performance by Cindi Lauper. Jeff Goldblum is charming, bemused and droll and Peter Falk is so funny. They all wind up in South America seeking \"a room of gold\", and dancing a lovely tango. The scenery is beautiful, the music lush. I consider this movie a friend.",
         "I think Vibes was a very funny film. Jeff Goldblum and Cyndi Lauper were very cute together and Peter Falk was very delightful to watch. The plot was crazy but I think it was supposed to be. The special effects were very good and you couldn't help but like the characters (mostly Cyndi Lauper)",
         "Sylvia (Cyndi Lauper) and Nick (Jeff Goldblum) meet at an institute studying those individuals who have psychic abilities. Sylvia channels a lady named Louise, who can predict the future, and Nick can touch objects and then give detailed accounts of the objects' history. Whew! This twosome do not exactly hit it off, at first. Then, Sylvia learns that her boyfriend only wants her around so he can win at the racetrack and Nick discovers his long-standing partner has been cheating, too. Suddenly, Harry (Peter Falk) appears and asks for the duo's help in locating his missing son in Ecuador. He'll pay bigtime, of course. It's off to South America, to battle forces of evil in a quest for truth and, possibly, a treasure. Can Sylvia and Nick begin to like each other among the Inca ruins? This is, truly, a funny movie. Lauper does a great job as the much put-upon Brooklyn dame and Goldblum is quite nice as her more learned and unexpected suitor. Falk is just down right hilarious as the scheming Harry. The script has some great one-liners and surprises while who can resist an exotic setting south of the border? If you should stumble across this film on television or at the video store, give it a whirl. It will bring a dose of sunshine into your life.",
         "I was impressed with Cyndi's portrayal here. She handled herself like a real star. Like your comedy to have a little history about ancient civilizations? Ever wanted to see the Yucatan? Ever wanted to be in an exotic jungle hotel with Cyndi Lauper or Jeff Goldblum? Ever wanted to see a really good comedic venture? Then \"Vibes\" is your movie. It has all that, a fun comedy/adventure plot, witty and clever dialog, good direction, wonderful scenic shots of South America and convincing portrayals, all rolled into a high hairdo and deep, soulful brown eyes. Nice portrayals by Julian Sands and Peter Falk are also featured here. Jeff Goldblum and Cyndi Lauper portray psychics hired by a man of questionable motivations to find his son who disappeared while looking for an ancient Incan city. At least, that's how it begins. Where it goes from there will lead you on a grand adventure fraught with magicks more ancient than mankind itself, and treachery. This is one of those movies I can (and do) watch all the time. It's one of my absolute favorites, and rates an 8.7/10 from... the Fiend :."
