      "synopsis": "On a flight from New York to Los Angeles, the twelve-year-old Ryan Walker ( Brendon Ryan Barrett) sits next to a girl named Jennifer ( Raquel Beaudene), who has just had her first period, and they chat about their parents' divorces and end up arguing. Four years later at Harding High School, Jennifer ( Claire Forlani) is named homecoming queen while Ryan ( Freddie Prinze Jr.) has an accident while in uniform as the team's mascot. When they talk afterwards, Jennifer realizes that he is the same guy from the flight and asks him out for coffee, but they argue and Ryan declines. Even later, Ryan is a freshman at Berkeley, has a new roommate, the girl-crazy non-stop liar Hunter ( Jason Biggs), and is trying to maintain a long-distance relationship with his high school sweetheart ( Alyson Hannigan). They soon break up. It turns out Jennifer also goes to Berkeley. She is living with her boyfriend, but then he breaks up with her in a song and she ends up moving in with her friend Amy ( Amanda Detmer), who talks about her therapist a lot. Ryan and Jennifer share their break-up stories, but end up arguing again. A year later, Ryan has a new girlfriend, who turns out to be Amy. When Ryan comes to pick her up one day it is Jennifer who is waiting to break up with him on Amy's behalf. When Ryan tries to persuade Amy that they are right for each other he has an accident with some icy balm, and instead he ends up spending the day with Jennifer. He tells her he is going off relationships because they are too uncertain and unplannable, unlike the Golden Gate bridge they are looking at. She, on the other hand, has no life plan and prefers the unpredictable. As school starts after the summer, Jennifer meets Ryan at registration and tells him about her summer fling, which brings her to tears because she pushed the guy away even though she really liked him. Later they spend a day together in San Francisco and go dancing at night, and another night Jennifer has Ryan bail her out of a bad date. When Amy asks Jennifer if she's in love with Ryan, Jennifer refuses, and Ryan does the same when Hunter asks him. When Jennifer asks him if he sees her as a substitute for a girlfriend, he starts dating another girl, Megan ( Heather Donahue). When Jennifer herself has man trouble she becomes disillusioned with love and gives a big speech to Ryan and the rest of the cafe they're in - but they end up kissing and sleeping together. The next day things are weird between them, and they decide that it was a mistake. Ryan, however, shies away from Jennifer for weeks until she is about to leave Berkeley for Italy. When they finally meet they argue, and Ryan tells Jennifer that he thinks they were meant to be together, even though he had never planned for it to happen and that he is hurt that Jennifer didn't feel the same way. A few days later Jennifer is leaving for the airport on a bus. Amy and Hunter, who is now going by his real name Steve, meet at the bus stop and hit it off. When the bus is in the middle of the Golden Gate bridge, Jennifer makes a decision, forces the driver to stop and goes back to Berkeley where she finds Amy with Hunter, who tells her Ryan has already left for LA. On the airplane, Ryan is awaiting departure when Jennifer boards the plane and announces her love for him. They argue, but she persuades him, and they kiss as the plane takes off.",

         "Note that I say \"movie\" and not \"film\". I was dragged to see this, but I found myself really liking it. The chemistry is wonderful and even though the storyline isn't the most original thing in the world, it has enough spark to keep it going. Definitely more of a rent-able movie, but let down your guard about teen flicks. This one is pretty good. :)",
         "Okay, technically, it was kind of predictable in the case that boy meets girl, boy and girl encounter turbulence in relationship, and then boy and girl end up back together at the very end of the movie. However, let me ask you this: How else is a romantic comedy suppose to go? I challenge anyone who isolates this flick's unoriginality as the reason for their dislike to come up with a better overall plot for a romantic comedy. I think that the writers did an excellent job of adding onto the generic template and making this film enjoyable to watch. First of all there's the whole thing with \"fated\" meetings where the two main characters seem just unable to get away from each other which adds that sweet \"soul mates\" ideal (even though I personally don't buy into that stuff, there is an undeniable charm to the idea). Then there is the still-unoriginal-but-not-yet-hackneyed idea of attempting a mere friendship between the guy and the girl. Finally, there is the inevitable falling in love, the relationship problems, and then the falling back in love towards the end of the movie. As a matter of fact, the only problem I have with the script is the miniscule hypocrisy found in it: at some point in the movie, Jennifer states that a romance movie never shows the affect of time on long term relationships, and this movie was not an exception as it ends with them making up and going off to live \"happily ever after\". Now we can look at the undeniable chemistry and superb acting of the two main characters, Ryan and Jennifer. The interactions of these two characters is the classic example of not getting along as kids but falling in love as adults. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlani are two of the up and coming celebrities of teen movies and I personally feel that they did their part in this movie by acting well. Also, the principle humor of this movie did not lie in the common slapstick or sexual humor, although Jason Biggs does add in those factors hilariously. I think the main characters came off as more intellectual (as one majors in engineering and the other in Latin) so the writers aimed more towards clever jokes, anecdotes, and quip remarks which, to me, seemed just as hilarious as Jason Biggs's antics. All in all, this isn't the BEST movie in the world, but it IS definitely a good movie if you want to watch a movie that will make you feel like Love is something real and not just some random idea that people have in their heads.",
         "All the critics seem to be saying that this movie is trying to be \"When Harry Met Sally\" and failing miserably at it, instead of seeing what a nice change of pace it is to see a romantic movie about two people who don't cuss and run around naked. I get so tired of seeing the same plot line over and over and then when someone makes an original movie like \"Boys and Girls\" it is bashed because people say it is boring. It is not boring, it just contains great dialogue instead of the usual lame boyfriend girlfriend story where they all try to figure out who to sleep with next or what funny sex scene they can come up with. It is incredibly sweet and it contains a great performance by the wonderful Claire Forlani. She is such an incredible actress and no one seems to notice. The same thing happened with \"Meet Joe Black\" because it had wonderful dialogue and no one saw that either. I think people just don't like movies with any character development that may actually cause you to think about anything other than what will blow up next. If you want to see something that takes a little effort to understand, then go see \"Boys and Girls\". The dance scene alone is worth the $7.00.",
         "In an era when \"teenage-girl movies\" run rampant, it is easy to dismiss this as just another flick targeted to make young girls squeal over Freddie Prinze Jr or one of his 20-something cohorts. Boys and Girls, however, is different. It presents itself with much more class, and comedy, than most other films of its genre. Boys and Girls has an engaging story that makes the audience connect, emotionally, with the problems of the main characters. The film has more than one story that it follows. It touches on the lives of four different college students and their failing attempts at social interaction. Its involving story line is strengthened by the funny parts, too. Each character has their own unique quirks that make the viewing experience that much more enjoyable. Boys and Girls leaves many other films of merit in its dust and deserves much more recognition than it has received.",
         "Boys and Girls is a predictable but fun look at two young people who are friends with potential. This movie follows Ryan, an uptight nerdy type who feels all life should be planned out to the very minute. Enter Jennifer, a quirky fun and free girl who is out to enjoy life as the adventure it is. Ryan and Jennifer meet a few times over the years before finally settling into a comfortable friendship at college. Where will their relationship go as they share more of their lives together? It's an obvious movie with an incredibly close resemblance to When Harry Met Sally (somewhat less clever than its grownup counterpart, but cute nonetheless). Freddie Prinze Jr. and Claire Forlaini have wonderful chemistry and are fun to watch (especially in the dance club scene). Ryan's best friend and Jennifer's best friend are played by Jason Biggs and Amanda Detmer with whimsical freedom. They provide much of the comic relief and are an enjoyable distraction from the plot. If you want a little escape from life for a few hours, this movie is just the light, enjoyable distraction you could be looking for.",
         "This movie is an interesting piece of filmwork. The characters are completely believable, the story is effective and funny, and the actors pull it off with such distinction, I have new faith in Prinze's ability to act. Many say these are the only roles he's good in - so what? If this type of character is what he does best, let him stick to it. Claire Forlani is a new face, but bright and powerful, with the kind of new charm we first got from Hewitt or Gellar. This movie is a romance, so it may not appeal to everyone, but altogether, it is a decent movie, recommended for about 10 and up.",
         "Sometimes you want to watch a film, not to hugely stimulate the mind but to stimulate the heart and this one did it for me. The romantic concept was a familiar one of boy and girl meet but don't seem to get together and they become 'friends' but when they do strife comes of it. The ending may have been predictable but it was uplifting and very sweet and even though it's just a film you come out feeling optimistic that maybe happy endings do exist.",
         "This film may be predictable, but it is so in a good way. I found it fun yet thoughtful at the same time. Its a Romantic Comedy that has something about it that makes you laugh out loud or cringe with embarrassment! I reccomend this film to anyone who wants a good laugh and a good cry! I give it 8/10.",
         "Thoroughly enjoyed the film. The chemistry between Freddie and Claire was great. Would recommend this to anyone who loved 'When Harry met Sally'. Jason Biggs is great as the best friend showing more character than in the American Pie films. If you like Claire Forlani then you must watch 'Meet Joe Black'!!",
         "Yes, I simply love this movie. I love this kind of movie, that has both romance and comedy in it. And Claire Forlani is brilliant, here acting skills is huge and she's THE most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Freddy Prince is good too, plays great, and his role is great. Jason Biggs' role is very funny, and gives the movie the comedy touch, that I love. What more can I say??... I love it, and I think it's brilliant... It's a MUST SEE."
