         "The War Room does a good job of extolling the skills of James Carville and George Stephanopolous. Clearly, their work had much to do with Clinton's victory. A little known fact about the film is that the actual campaign manager, David Wilhelm, refused to participate in it. He didn't like the idea of a camera crew roaming the headquarters and recording conversations that he felt should have been private. Clinton overruled him, of course. As a result, the documentary skews history a bit. The nuts and bolts of running a campaign are ignored while the craft of spin doctoring is glorified. In a visual medium, that's not altogether surprising, and it may even have been unavoidable. But the misrepresentation -- or rather, the selective representation -- has had the unintended consequence of contributing to public cynicism about political campaigns, which now appear to be all about the spin, the framing -- the very things that make voters feel like they're being manipulated. Perhaps a stronger emphasis on the heavy lifting of door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, meetings with interest groups, outreach to local officials, event set-up, and the like, would have given a more complete picture. Then again, those aren't exactly telegenic activities, and documentary filmmakers may have been hard-pressed to incorporate them even if Wilhelm had cooperated. But the troublesome implications remain, and are worth considering.",
         "I first saw this at Doc Films at the University of Chicago. I was expecting it to be interesting, but dry. Wow, was I wrong. The entire audience was enthralled and frequently laughing their heads off. You couldn't make up comedic characters like these if you tried. James and George are just amazing. (Of course, there would be times where HALF the audience was laughing, split along party lines. :-) ) The filmmakers also liven up the proceedings with good choices of music and little bits of Americana tossed in here and there. Invite over all your political junkie friends, get a few beers, rent this movie, and enjoy.",
         "I have to admit, I came into watching this film with somewhat low expectations, as the last political documentary I watched was \"The Hunting of the President\" which I found to be ultimately a weak film, with little to no focus on politics whatsoever. As somewhat of a political junkie, I was impressed by this film's portrayal of what seems to be a rather honest look into the workings of a presidential campaign. However, I think the film misses a few point where it could focus on the actual strategies being made, but it chooses more to focus on the people making the strategies. It gives an interesting look into the \"reality\" of the campaign, but leaves the overall strategies left mostly unexplained. Still a good film though, enjoyed it a lot. Oh, and by the way, the previous reviewed was right on the mark saying that if you liked this you should read \"The Agenda\" by Bob Woodward. Same sort of style.",
         "I was taking a course in American Government at Rutgers when I saw this film. I fell in love with George Stephanopoulos right away. James Carville is always a delight to watch with his Cajun tongue and enthusiasm. This film documentary chronicles the Clinton election in 1992. I can't believe I miss that period now. Of course, the War Room is not for those who don't care anything about politics. The boy from Hope gave us hope and a promise that was fulfilled. Sure there was the sex scandals, at least they were interesting, the economy was headed in the right direction and we had surplus budget. Now, we're in two wars with no end in sight. Still, the War Room reminds us of the promises and the hope around election day.",
         "As a government teacher, this is one of the few movies I make sure I play EVERY year. The Ragin' Cajun is unstoppable in this film! Anyone who wishes to know EXACTLY what a campaign is like inside and out needs to check out this film. There is a scene in this film featuring George Stephanopoulous where he straight up threatens to end a guys political career, should he come out with allegations against Clinton. I am simply amazed that this scene wasn't edited out of the film. However, the simple fact that it wasn't helps me realize how \"real\" this film is. The only reason that I gave this a 9 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of 10 is simply that as time passes, the Bush v. Clinton election becomes slightly less and less relevant to viewers. Anyone younger than about 25 probably won't relate to the details (Jennifer Flowers, etc...) of this film.",
         "As a student of Political Sciences, I believe this to be one of the most fascinating and introspective documentaries regarding the subject of campaigning. The first modern campaign, the 92 Clinton war is an amazing melodrama of quick rises to power, downfalls, villains, heroes, and the precursor to one of the most vicious political battles of our nation's history. In the film, if you look hard enough, you see the seeds of weakness being sown which would lead to an awesome political showdown which is more grand, more high-stakes, and more dark than the plotline of any film in this database. Note: If you like \"The War Room,\" read Woodward's \"The Agenda.\"",
         "It's 1992. This documentary follows the Clinton campaign from the New Hampshire primary to its Little Rock headquarters as they win a landslide victory over Bush Sr. The team is led by the bombastic raging Cajun James Carville and the scholarly Greek George Stephanopoulos. They face scandals like Jennifer Flowers and draft dodging allegations. They try to work on a story of Bush printing campaign material in Brazil but nobody is willing to write it up. Then there is Perot walking away from the election and finally entering the fight. It's a great insight into the heart of the operation. It's not all cleaned up for the camera such as when George plays hardball against a final minute allegation that Clinton fathered a black baby. It is possibly the first of its kind and maybe not to be repeated. It's also fascinating that these characters would become political TV stars. It's a behind-the-scenes look unlike anything before or possibly since.",
         "Everything has been told here, very pointedly, about James Carville and George Stephanopoulos, the dream team - along with Paul Begala - which helped Clinton to win against the odds. I just rewatched the DVD after years and what really caught me this time was how awkward and downright embarrassing George H. W. Bush came across. Desperate to conceal his \"patrecian\" upbringing his juvenile verbal nasties were a hoot. In later years Junior was much more believable as a foulmouthed punk. Which pretty much sums up the ill advised campaign of Senior. Whipping H. W. into a fake frenzy and then present Mary Matalin as a voice of reason was a fatal choice against the Dem's candidate playing the emphatic considerate charm card accompanied by the fiery spinning of Carville and the quiet ruthlessness of boyish Stephanopoulos. And no, the filmmakers weren't biased in terms of Senior. The infamous \"Govenor Taxes and the Ozone man/Halloween\" weren't shown. As weren't lots of other gaffes. So as much as showing a winning campaign the 15 % of the Bush failing campaign on show are just as revealing.",
         "Although Bill Clinton became president of the United States, it was James Carville and George Stephanopolous won the elections in 1992. That seems to be what Hegedus and Pennebaker are telling us in their documentary The War Room, and for what it looks like, it must have been true. The democrats hadn't won an election in a long time. They, as people in charge of the Bill Vlinton electoral campaign changed the way campaigns would be run and seen. Or did they? History tells us that presidents have aways liked being presidents! They always tried to reach the audiences, always tried to use all the media at their disposals in the best of ways, and there always were people that managed their image and wrote their scripts. The premise seems to be pretentious and wrong. It is true, however, that this is possibly the one and only documentary that gives us such an insight of the organizing committee of a presidential campaign, and it is very interesting to see how things are run, and how people think. They are the underrated heroes. Before Clinton does anything, they think of it. In fact, we hardly ever see Clinton ourselves, which further strengthens the fact that it was them who won the elections, not him. Pennebakes does what he does best: direct cinema. But in comparison to other direct cinema legendary films, this one is hard to get fully into. In fact, the scenes that we are allowed to get into through good editing and cinematography are great, but the rest is just annoying and confusing. Also, it's hard to keep track of all that goes on in the war room, and although that was never going to be easy to do, it should have been done better. Still, a lot of it is very good, and worth a look, because the concept, the most important thing in a direct cinema film, is very interesting, and now that we know how things ended, pleasant to watch (unless you're a republican...) WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When Carville is asked by the media if Clinton went to Moscow. \"Yes\" answers Carville. He knows exactly what is doing.",
         "\"The War Room\" is a fantastic documentary that shows the behind the scenes and takes an inside look at a presidential campaign for president. This film follows then Arkansas governor Bill Clinton's track from the snowy cold first Primary in New Hampshire in January of 1992 to the final victory party on election night in November of 1992. The best scenes are shown in the campaign room when you hear the plans and game plans of the two most important Clinton insiders that being James Carville and George Stephanopoulos. Carville the outspoken and fiery southern who ran the campaign with charm and hard working passion. Really an emotional moment is when James gives his speech at the end by breaking down and crying really a touching moment for the viewer. While Stephanopoulos the brilliant and young bright mind who was an ex Rhodes Scholar does a fine job as the communications director helping Bill dodge and maneuver around such scandals as Gennifer Flowers and the draft dodge. The film also has plenty of highlights from the debates, speeches, campaign tours, and highlights of final election results too. Really a fine documentary of how a political campaign should be done, which most will find both educational and informative."
