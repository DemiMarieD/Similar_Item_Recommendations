         "content": "Ah, Colonel Braddock. I heard much about you. Welcome to the People's Republic of Vietnam.\r\n\r\nChuck Norris is Col. James Braddock, a survivor of a Vietnam Prisoner of War camp who many years later decides to return to find proof - and liberate - American soldiers still being held against their will.\r\n\r\nAs the 1980s boom for martial artists becoming filmic action stars gathered apace, Chuck Norris carved his own spot upon the testosterone fuelled wave. Much like a lot of films of its ilk, Missing in Action is of course daft, violent, jingoistic but also crucially it's a whole bunch of fun. This naturally comes down to expectation levels for a production of this type, park the brain and enjoy the cheese and carnage. It's a bit disappointing to find that we don't get to see much of Norris' martial artistry, it' s more a case of gun play and standard fists and kicks taking the lead in this one. The story is hardly taxing and many scenes just serve to show some flesh and pecs, but with M. Emmet Walsh along for the ride as an ebullient side-kick, there's enough here for the undemanding action film fan to enjoy. 5/10",

         "CLASSIC.........bad movie. It does all the things that critics would laugh at and more. It has bad acting, and a lame story. However, it's a lot of fun for those of you that enjoy lazy afternoon cheeseball films (such as myself). The best scene has to be the slow motion shot of Chuck Norris emerging from the swamp water with a rifle letting rounds off and keeping a \"stone face\"...hahahaha. Oh wow, how i love this movie. You really cannot argue a movie's credibility with a powerhouse lead actor such as Chuck Norris. RATING: 8/10 - Because it's an entertaining bad movie...great for those times when you're bored out of your mind on a rainy day.",
         "This was filmed back-to-back with part 2, and was originally intended to be released as the second film in the series, but Cannon executives moved it to be the first entry after realizing it was much better than the other film. It is indeed a better movie, but it still can't be called a good movie. To be sure, the production values are decent, and director Joseph Zito occasionally creates an effective moment. But for the most part, the movie is extremely dull; it takes more than halfway through the movie before Norris starts his primary mission, and the action sequences (the few that there are) are mediocre at best. Zito also shows no sense of pacing; there are a number of scenes that serve no real purpose, or are let to run on for what seems like forever. As for Norris, he is his usual stony near-mute self, though he is to be admired for doing some of the risky stunt sequences himself.",
         "A Vietnam war vet ( Chuck Norris ) and previous POW goes back to Vietnam ten years after . When Braddock arrives is accused of war crimes by a Vietnam general ( James Hong ). Then he schemes to free some American soldiers still held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . As long as he's there , Braddock decides to head Thailand where is pursued by a former enemy who tortured him in the concentration camp where he was prisoner . He's helped by a friend gunrunner ( M. Emmet Walsh ). The two-fisted Colonel Braddock tries continuously to free the prisoners held captives suffering various tortures in charge of the camp wardens and the evil ruler. This is a routine actioner with Karate star Chuck Norris as the Vietnam veteran resulting go be one of the best roles he'd made to date , as he's nice as tough, cold, stubborn Colonel Braddock . It's a predictable, shallow and brainless film though will appeal to Chuck Norris enthusiasts because of it contains some excellent action sequences ( when Braddock shoots with his machine gun or scenes about bounds and leaps of a motorboat ) . In the wake of ¨ Uncommon courage ¨( by Ted Kotcheff ) and ¨ RamboII ¨( George Pan Cosmatos ) with Norris attempting to imitate Silver Stallone or Arnold Schwarnezzegger like an one army man . The film is the original from a trilogy , concerning the second part ( directed by Lance Hool,the first's producer )about tortures and Braddock's suffering in prisoner camp and the third part ( directed by Aaron Norris, Chuck's brother ) upon looking for his wife after downfall Saigon . In the three movies there are some nasty , ominous villains well played by Asian players : James Hong, Soon Teck Oh, and Aki Aelong who bear offensive racial stereotypes . Appropriate musical score by Jay Chattaway and adequate cinematography by cameraman Joao Fernandez . The motion picture is produced by Cannon films ( Mennahem Golan and Yoram Globus ) and professionally directed by Joseph Zito ( USA invasion , again with Norris ). The motion picture will appeal to Chuck Norris fans .",
         "There has been great controversy about U.S. prisoners of war (POWs) and those missing in action (MIAs) during the Vietnam War� While Colonel Braddock - one of the outspoken proponents of the theory that Americans are still being held in Vietnam today - is now in Saigon at the president's request to see if there are more MIAs in Vietnam� The American delegation hopes Braddock's presence would increase their ability to negotiate� But General Trau (James Hong) believes that Colonel Braddock is not a prisoner of war, but a common criminal, brought to Saigon only in an attempt to embarrass his government� The sexy aide of Senator Porter, Lenore Kasdorf, thinks that Braddock is the most undiplomatic man she has ever met� The action begins when the Vietnam vet - not supposed to leave the hotel without an escort - assaults General Trau's residence, pays for a bullet-proof speed riverboat and blazes his way with an old war buddy called Tuck (M. Emmet Walsh) through the jungles of Saigon� Norris, challenging several unpredicted attacks from his enemies, takes at last his revenge after he experiences the fear, chaos and atrocities of the Vietnam hell�",
         "I was staying over-seas with nothing to do. As i searched through the rented room, all i found was Missing in Action. After popping it in I couldn't stop watching. I have never laughed harder at a movie since watching this. This movie was utterly ridiculous. The first scene alone made me fall out of my chair. This is the cheesiest and fakest movie EVER! I'm not saying it's even decent as a movie, at all, but it sure is funny to watch.",
         "This is a typical Chuck Norris film and typical 80's action film. It follows a simple and commercially successful script: Lots of action scenes, lots of nudity, one liners, plenty of stunts and some moments of pure fantasy. This film is great for those wanting to sit with popcorn and watch a film where you know what you're going to get. But this film sacrifices a lot of realism to achieve it. Scenes of helicopters making outrageous pick ups or so many Vietnamese henchmen with poor aims when it comes to shooting Chuck are some examples. This film is pure action based, as the movie went on, it was action sequence after action sequence and personally, I was fed up with too much. There is so much wrong with this film technically and is you want to watch a clever, powerful dramatic and original action film ,then this isn't for you. If you want to watch a predictable, satisfying, simple adrenaline fuelled kill-fest, then you'll like this.",
         "SPOILER ALERT! Further down, I will reveal what I thought was the most funny parts of this movie, including stuff from the ending! I would like to start off with introducing myself as a fan of Chuck Norris. Although (or perhaps, just because) I'm a member of Mensa and have just recieved a bachelor's degree in computer networking, I enjoy to sometimes just put the whole intellectual/elitist attitude behind me and dive into a macho B-action from the 80's starring people like Chuck Norris, Steven Segall, Charles Bronson, Dolph Lundgren or Jean-Claude Van Damme. The mid-80's was the age of bazookas, M16s and M60s, and the heroes were super-heroes who could stand how much punishment as imaginable by the director, just as long as they stayed focused on getting to the goal. 10 years later it became more popular to depict action with a somewhat deeper touch of realism, often performed by people acting as elite troopers with M4s and M249s (weapons which are \"successors\" of the classical M16 and the M60). I like both decade's action movies, but the mid-80's action has the power of nostalgia... After having heard a lot about this particular movie from several friends in my class at college - who were also into B-actions - I decided to dedicate a couple of hours trying to find it. Since the DVD version of this movie probably hasn't been printed in too many copies, there were no DivXs available anywhere. So I settled out to do what I should've done from the beginning - supporting one of my favorite action heroes by buying his stuff! I mean, Chuck doesn't seem like the gazillonare-type actor that you see in Sylvester Stallone :) So finally, the day before yesterday, tuesday 2002-03-12, I found it at Mega Skivakademien, Stockholm's largest (?) record/video store in the very heart of the capital kernel. It was on sale, too! Only 99 swedish kronas (less than ten bucks) for 1 hour and 52 minutes of brainless entertainment! So I watched it, and what did I like? These are the things i remember and will carry with me until I become old and senile (or maybe turn psycho after having watched too many B-actions from the 80's): 1. The sunglasses Chuck wear at the diplomatic meeting in Vietnam! Brown-to-transparent fade, and they are HUGE! 2. Chuck's attack-raft... Its potons are made out of kevlar and therefore it is regarded as bullet-proof! It can take fire from an AK-47 Kalasjnikov without being punctured! Brilliant! :D 3. After the vietcong have sunk the attack-raft with a rocket launcher and stand laughing at their typical Pacific-Rim-fishing-boat-ish boat, Chuck surfaces with the M60 from the raft that he seems to have dismounted at swimmed up with (those things weigh in at... Like... 30 pounds!) and finished off all three of them in one sweep! Is he cool or what... 4. When Chuck returns home with the POWs at the very end of the movie and enters the hotel where the diplomatic conference is held with an american MIA soldier under his right arm, the movie is abruptly ended and the aftertexts starts scrolling up. Now THAT'S a Norris movie in a nutshell... No bull to be found there! :)",
         "Chuck Norris is a terrible actor. He may be good at that karate stuff that he does, but that's all he has going for him. Well, I guess the ladies like his body (I know of a couple who do). The story stinks, the acting stinks, the special effects are decent, but pretty much everything else about this film stinks. It smacks of patriotism and tries to strike that chord in the viewer. It fails at that by being just plain blatant. Overall, a real lousy film. Don't waste your time.",
         "Then I say go for it! But for those of you who want a movie with real substance and plot, run away from this film. I kind of found this movie entertaining in a brainless sense. Chuck Norris turns in a typical performance, the action is the same as we've all seen before, and it was pretty much 80's all over. A definite must-see for action addicts.",
         "Former `Nam veteran goes back into the jungle to save American POWs from nasty commie scum . Hey didn`t Sly Stallone .... ? Believe it or not this film managed to offend me more than RAMBO:FIRST BLOOD PART 2 . Both films show the Vietnamese as being cruel , stupid incompetent communist vermin but MIA shows a Vietnamese general begging for his life like a sobbing schoolgirl . I`ve read a lot about the war in South East Asia from a myriad of American sources , everything from Jane Fonda to Soldier Of Fortune magazine and there`s many different angles as to what observers thought of the VC but they all agree on one thing - There were no cowards in the Viet Cong . I was also taken aback with seeing the concept of the Vietnamese secret police travelling to Thailand to bump off our hero like an oriental KGB , sorry but I was under the impression the Vietnamese just wanted to be left alone and wouldn`t have the inclination to bump off Americans in foreign lands , but why let reality get in the way of a film that screams America good , pinko commie scum bad . When this film was released in 1984 more than a third of the world`s population lived under a communist system . You`ve got to wonder if there`s a connection between the two"

When he arrives the General in charge makes some disparaging remarks to Braddock and they accuse him of crimes against them. Braddock later goes to the General and demands to know where the POW's are and after telling Braddock he tries to kill him but Braddock kills him. Later he is asked to leave, he then goes to Thailand to see a friend and to try and get those men out. But he is being pursued by a man who tortured him when he was a prisoner."
