         "The students in a small Texan town have a new teacher from England (Olivia D'Abo). She is trying hard to motivate and communicate with her pupils, with only limited success. Limited, that is, until she gets her students excited about soccer. She assembles a ragtime team, with no uniforms, and teaches them about the fundamentals of soccer. The team, with a mixture of girls and boys, begins playing matches. They lose. The teacher enlists the help of the local sheriff (Steve Guttenberg) and, together, they help the team improve. But, will they succeed in winning soccer games? This is another stroll down Mighty Ducks lane but it is still a good film for children. It's themes of hard work and teamwork are undeniable and very worthwhile. The actors, the script, and the Texas setting form a touching and funny film. If you want to find a good family film for a night at home, try this one. Big grins will pop up over The Big Green.",
         "OK, the Big Green is not academy award quality. But it features a fine cast, led by Steve Guttenberg. It is set in rural Texas, and the kids on the soccer team don't have much confidence in their ability to win the big one. But a teacher transfer from England, a gorgeous woman at that, helps turn them around. The scene-stealer is Milt Oberman as the referee in the final game, delivering a riveting, if somewhat understated, performance. This is a great feel-good movie to watch especially with your kids or grandkids. But adults should all enjoy it also.",
         "This movie is great for kids, and any kid should see it. Many teens and adults may find this movie wasteful, but anyone who keeps an open mind and makes efforts to \"read between the lines\" can really see that there is a lesson to be learned. As in reality, there are many towns such as the fictional rural town this movie takes place in. In such towns (with closed industrial mills and no jobs,) you will find kids with too much time on their hands like in this movie. At the beginning, the kids didn't see a point to their lives and just didn't care. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) didn't have much of a life either. Anna Montgomery comes to town as the school teacher and really turns them around. She really teaches them to believe that they are no less of people than anyone else and that with hard work and persistence, one can achieve their goals. They don't even know how to play soccer in the beginning, but it goes to show that hard work, heart, persistence, belief, and teamwork can go a long ways. Anna Montgomery is a terrific teacher, coach, and leader. Towards the end, anyone can tell that they are changed for the better and learn to believe in themselves on and off the field, thanks to true leadership. I admit, this is not a movie with tons of adventure and excitement. Though it may not be a classic like Forrest Gump or Citizen Kane; it really is a great family movie and really goes to prove a point. I recommend it to anyone with a family and a heart to see the good that can come with good leadership and teamwork.",
         "I was around 8 or 9 when this movie came out. Despite there already being plenty of movies about misfits rising to the top,like The Mighty Ducks and Angles in the Outfield, this movie really was the best of them all. It of course starts out like normal, with the kids being resentful to anything new and having all-around bad attitudes. But with the help of a good coach and a new activity to immerse themselves in, their moral and moods change for the better, making them the winners they are. The journey to their win contains many easy laughs, and just a tiny bit of drama and romance. A movie for boys and girls alike ;) I thought it was and still is a great kids movie. I'm 20 now, and I still watch it to this day. Its a great feel-good movie for the whole family to enjoy!",
         "A great family film about soccer. I've loved this movie ever since I was a child. The plot isn't anything special and is rather predictable but the numerous comic scenes make up for it. the film not only deals with soccer but also with some more serious issues including one family's immigration problems and another child with an alcoholic father. The name The Big Green refers to the team's name which was what the field they play on used to be called. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when the children are practicing while the parents look on, when it starts to rain the kids wont give up the ball and the coaches and parents try and get the ball. what happens is a cute moment between all of the families playing soccer in the rain and mud together. overall this film is just very cute and I highly recommend it especially for families with young kids. or even for elderly people who can no longer understand a very complicated plot, my grandmother really enjoys this movie. anyways if you haven't seen this movie you should seek it out and watch it when you get the chance.",
         "Even at 13 this film is still one of my favorites I borrowed it from my friend and got it for christmas one year. One day a group of misfit kids decide to go for a bike ride and feed some birds and a lady thinks their being attacked she claims that she is their teacher. These kids are playing around at the police station and are told off by sheriff Tom Palmer. Determined to motivate her students Anna forms a soccer team with the help of Tom Palmer. At the field they meet a group of bullies also a soccer team called The Knights coached by the snobbish Jay Huffer Tom's old nemesis. The Knights wind up winning by a final score of 18-0. But they soon become a winning team and defeat The Knights in the championship game 4-3. In the end Jay Has to kiss the goat. 9/10",
         "The picture concerns about an English teacher named Anna Montgomery(Olivia DÃbo) who comes a Texas little town for teaching at a very young school. She must educate a kiddies with down self-esteem. Anna organizes a soccer team and is helped by the town sheriff(Steve Guttenberg). Abundant difficulties throw out when the contender team with a nasty coach(Jay O. Sanders) is formed with the best in the league ,besides the principal player disappears for problems of immigration. At the beginning the team shaped by underdog and geeky members lose the match but they recuperate the position later. The film has lots of amusement and fun. It's agreeable movie for kids who they will enjoy enormously.The movie is a soccer version of Â¨Mighty DucksÂ¨and Â¨Bad new bears Â¨(Michael Ritchie) and recently adapted by Richard Linklater with Billy Bob Thorton as the coacher . However the film didn't obtain success as anterior version and barely attained hit smash at the box office.The picture has its amusing moments here and there, specially when the goalkeeper imagines the attacker players disguised as various characters. The motion picture will appeal to children and soccer buffs . Rating : Average but bemusing.",
         "The Big Green is another one of those underdogs who win in the end type films, but that is Disney for you. Steve Guttenberg actually gives a good performance in this kiddie soccer movie, Patrick Renna is also good. The Big Green is a nice kids movie and can be enjoyed by all, but Disney needs to get off the \"underdog\" thing, it gets old.",
         "Seriously, what's with the ratings!??? Why a 5.4??? And why does the Sandlot have a 7.8??? THEY SHOULD BE SWITCHED AROUND! Patrick Renna, the kid who keeps seeing those weird & laughable nightmares as the goalie, is mostly known for the Sandlot (a really stupid movie in my opinion, I don't get that either) The whole premise of this story is fun, the cast is fun, the story is fun, the sport is fun, the music is fun, the whole movie is all around FUN! This movie is also more APPROPRIATE for kids than the Sandlot - that movie had really rude humor, constant name-calling, scary & weird premises, and just all around bratty kids with bad attitudes! Trust me, never show your children that film - they'll likely turn out to be spoiled. Seriously, the Big Green gang have so much more chemistry together than the socially awkward Sandlot! The Big Green, consisting of both boys & girls, are able to work together without rubbing body parts! The Sandlot was just putrid in that area - it treats women just as \"conquests for men.\" Petty. Bug Hall, who played Alfalfa in \"The Little Rascals\", was also in this movie, and he's a favorite child actor of mine. It also has one of my most favorite actors, Steve Guttenberg, a Jewish guy, who I really like! Your children WILL enjoy this film today! It's appropriate & funny, humorous, and enjoyable for children of all ages. And Randy Edelmen's musical score is especially good - he's wizard behind conducting! He's quite underrated as a composer. 8/10",
         "This movie is great for kids, and any kid should see it. Many teens and adults may find this movie wasteful, but anyone who keeps an open mind and makes efforts to \"read between the lines\" can really see that there is a lesson to be learned. As in reality, there are many towns such as the fictional rural town this movie takes place in. In such towns (with closed industrial mills and no jobs,) you will find kids with too much time on their hands like in this movie. At the beginning, the kids didn't see a point to their lives and just didn't care. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) didn't have much of a life either. Anna Montgomery comes to town as the school teacher and really turns them around. She really teaches them to believe that they are no less of people than anyone else and that with hard work and persistence, one can achieve their goals. They don't even know how to play soccer in the beginning, but it goes to show that hard work, heart, persistence, belief, and teamwork can go a long ways. Anna Montgomery is a terrific teacher, coach, and leader. Towards the end, anyone can tell that they are changed for the better and learn to believe in themselves on and off the field, thanks to true leadership. I admit, this is not a movie with tons of adventure and excitement. Though it may not be a classic like Forrest Gump or Citizen Kane; it really is a great family movie and really goes to prove a point. I recommend it to anyone with a family and a heart to see the good that can come with good leadership and teamwork."
