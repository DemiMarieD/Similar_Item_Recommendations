      "synopsis": "Ruth Patchett (Roseanne Barr) lives in the suburbs outside New York City with her husband Bob (Ed Begley, Jr.) and her children Nicolette and Andy (Elisabeth Peters and Bryan Larkin). She is a competent and loving homemaker but her skills are often pushed aside by the fact that she is extremely clumsy, unattractive, and overweight. Bob works as an accountant in New York City and takes Ruth to a party at the Guggenheim Museum, to \"network.\" At the party Ruth spills her wine on romance novelist Mary Fisher (Meryl Streep), much to Bob's embarrassment. Before Ruth can return with Bob's stain-fighting prescription of salt and Perrier however, Bob has already offered to drive Mary home, and she lives more than two hours away from the Patchett's home. Bob drops Ruth off at the curb in front of the entrance to their street, leaving her to walk home. Upon arrival to Mary's \"palace on the sea,\" she invites Bob in. However, the butler Garcia (A Martinez) has been waiting up for Mary all night, and is clearly displeased when he is sent straight to bed by Mary. In her office, Bob and Mary's \"business meeting\" quickly turns intimate and Bob spends the night. Upon arrival home the next morning in the middle of breakfast, Bob announces that he has landed Mary Fisher's account. Ruth becomes suspicious that Bob is having an affair, and begins to try to please him by doing extra chores around the house, such as cutting the grass and fixing the sink, and trying to look more attractive, going so far as to shave her unsightly mustache. Bob's affair continues, and Mary becomes annoyed when she must share him with Ruth; and Ruth, now sure of the nature of Bob's late nights at the office, approaches him. Bob responds that Ruth is his best friend, that his business with Mary is purely business related, and that he wouldn't hurt her, but warns her not to \"start\" as his parents are coming over for dinner. The dinner does not go according to plan. Bob spends another long day at the \"office\" and can't help Ruth cook. As a result, food is already coming out charred to a crisp and the appetizer of clam puffs has to be changed to cheese and crackers, which are also nearly spilled onto the floor when Ruth trips. The mushroom soup, which she had made just for Bob, as it is one of his favorite dishes, is revealed to hold Andy's missing gerbil when the lid is removed from the dish. A firefight ensues. Bob calls Ruth an incompetent homemaker and a lousy cook, and reveals to the kids that he only married her because she was already pregnant. Ruth storms out, and tells him that if he wants dinner, he can have Mary Fisher cook it for him. Bob's parents have had enough, and storm out--of the house. Bob moves out later in the night permanently, insulting Ruth all the way out the door. He tells her that he has four assets he holds dear: His house, his family, his career, and his freedom to enjoy them. When it comes to liabilities, he exclaims he only has one: Ruth herself. He calls her a 'She-Devil' and leaves. Ruth is enraged. She writes down his assets and vows to check them off one by one. She starts with the house, destroying it by starting a fire. She throws a live hanging lighting fixture, a clothing iron, and all of her books by Mary Fisher, which she had once enjoyed to read, into the washing machine. She turns on Nicolette's hairdryer, places it on the bed and covers it in pillows, overloads a single electrical outlet with nearly ten appliances, jams a food blender with a knife, throws a lit cigarette into the wastebasket, blows out the pilot light to the stove--with the gas still running, and places several aerosol cans into the microwave. She takes a picture of her family, the list of Bob's assets, the dog, and her lipstick, and makes it out of the house just in time for it to erupt in flames. Already she has an asset to knock off the list. Having nowhere to live herself, she drops the kids off at Mary's place to stay with their father, conveniently just as Bob and Mary share an intimate moment in the swimming pool. Bob protests, but Ruth outruns him in a taxi. Ruth starts a new life under a new name, Vesta Rose, inspired by a woman selling roses on the street, and heads to where Mary's estranged mother Mrs. Fisher (Sylvia Miles) lives, the Golden Twilight Nursing Home. Under her new identity, she secures a job as an orderly under the home's owner Mrs. Trumper (Mary Louise Wilson), and Nurse Hooper (Linda Hunt), only to discover that the home's residents are drugged nearly to the point of coma. Ruth decides it's time to wake them up, and switches the home's sedatives with plain vitamins. After the change Ruth starts a soccer league, which the old residents play out on the lawn still dressed in their housecoats and slippers. Hooper is irate, but decides that she won't tell Trumper when Ruth appeals to her and tells her that all women like themselves should stick together. Now alert, Ruth gets to know Mrs. Fisher, who turns out to be a chirpy and wisecracking old woman who does not speak favorably about her daughter. She talks Mrs. Fisher into visiting Mary, and puts her on the train herself. Meanwhile at Mary's, it is revealed Mary is inept to handle any task related to motherhood, and this is compounded by the fact that the kids don't listen to anything she says anyways. Nicolette sits on the lawn blasting the radio and talking on the phone all day, while Andy watches TV in the living room while Bob is still seen flirting with still more women. Furthermore, Mary's beloved toy poodle is killed when Andy throws a stick off the back edge of her property and the dog follows it into the rocky sea below. Mary begins to reach her breaking point when she is forced to do the unthinkable--laundry. The maid Ute (Susan Willis) is busy cleaning after the ever growing mess and the butler refuses to do anything but lounge in the swimming pool in protest of not being Mary's front line man. Mary, having never used a washing machine before, ruins all of Nicolette and Andy's clothes, pouring an indiscriminate amount of bleach directly on the clothes before starting the washer. Dinner is now shown at Mary's house with her mother over. Mary's hatred toward her mother is clearly shown--she doesn't even invite her to dinner, Mrs. Fisher discovers it herself and directs herself to a seat. On top of this, Mrs. Fisher reveals that Mary is not age 34 as she had claimed, but actually 41. Ruth and Hooper are enjoying lunch when Ruth breaks out her specialty--rich cakes and desserts. Hooper can't help but taste more and more, never having had a sweet in years. She warms up to Ruth and tells her that she has over $55,000 in the bank, as she has next to no expenses and has been working the nursing home for decades. Ruth exclaims that money has no value if it's not put to use, but leaves when Hooper reluctantly decides not to leave the home. Her mind is quickly changed however when Ruth is fired from her job. Incontinence is strictly forbidden at the Golden Twilight home, and Trumper discovers a big wet spot where Ruth had dumped Mrs. Fisher's bedpan into the bed and Ruth does not deny hiding the spot. Mrs. Fisher is not long welcome in the Golden Twilight home, securing her a permanent spot at Mary's crumbling palace by the sea (just as Ruth had planned). Ruth boards a bus toward New York City, and nearly leaves without Hooper who catches the bus at just the last second by chasing it nearly down the street. Meanwhile, Mary seems to be getting a burst in confidence when a journalist from People magazine comes to interview her. Mary is sidetracked from her new tea-time snack of Yoohoo and aerosol cheese by a phone call, and Mrs. Fisher quickly takes advantage of the situation to be interviewed and drops a bombshell--Mary was a \"teenage tramp\" who would do it \"anywhere, anytime, and with anyone\" and gave birth to a son that was fathered by a butcher when she was 16. The \"heir\" to the Fisher dynasty was adopted by another family, however. Ruth can cross of Bob's family from the list. Ruth and Hooper move to New York City where they move into a small apartment together as roommates, and using Hopper's money, they buy a run-down building in the World Trade Center district to open an employment agency for women like Ruth herself. Through much advertisement, the agency is packed on its very first day in business, despite the office still going through renovation. Ruth begins to form her own \"army\" of women, getting them jobs as data processors, bank tellers, and court reporters all over the city. One of her clients is the very young, and very attractive Olivia Honey (Maria Pitillo). Ruth, disguising her voice, and using a special ad just for Bob, gets Olivia a job at Bob's new office right in the World Trade Center. She becomes his next fling. But when \"Bobby\" won't get more serious with her, she asks Ruth for advice. She tells Ruth that his wife is a \"real nut\" who left him with the kids and that his current living arraignment is working out so great. Ruth tells Olivia she needs to speak her heart, that she loves Bob. Bob promptly fires Olivia, but not before she has gained unprecedented access to his financial information, and reveals to Ruth that he skims the interest off his clients accounts and wires it to a bank in Switzerland. Meanwhile, Mary publishes her next book, \"Love in the Rinse Cycle\", which promptly flops in sales and criticism. What's worse is that the new People article has been published, and it's a blistering tell-all. Mary begins to lose control, crying all day and taking copious amounts of anxiety medication to the point of collapsing spread out in bed. Ruth and Olivia plan a midnight Rendez-vous and sneak into Bob's office transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars into Bob's private overseas bank account in order to make more of the embezzlement charges they plan to file against him. With Olivia distracted, Ruth filters through Bob's files, and finds photocopies of Olivia's butt on the copy machine with Bob pinching them, while wearing the special ring Mary gave him engraved with his initials. The angered Ruth sends this letter to Mary under the disguise of a fan letter. This combined with the fact that the maid has quit makes Mary completely lose it, and when she finds Nicolette getting romantic with Garcia and Andy drinking with her mother, she puts her foot down, and declares herself boss, \"Starting now!\" Ruth, now having sufficient evidence to accuse Bob of his fraud, she annymously calls the IRS and reports the crime. Still tense in the house, Mary throws a party to revitalize herself, but it comes to a grinding halt when detectives come to arrest Bob. After a meeting with an expensive attorney who revealed that not only will Bob's case be heard before a judge very lax toward white collar criminals, but that most of the stolen money came from Mary's account (which was the result of Ruth and Olivia's computer hacking). Mary wants Bob out, and fires him and tells him that their relationship is over... for good. Ruth contacts one of her many soldiers, a court clerk (Lori Tan Chinn), and asks if the judge can be changed to one more impartial. Grateful for Ruth's services, the now-clerk readily agrees and pulls strings to get \"Judge Brown\" to hear Bob's case now, instead of the lenient Judge Phillips. Bob's case is heard where the unbias, but unsymathetic Judge Brown, a female African-American judge, does not take any pity on him, nor buys his contraditing \"computer glitch\" defense to the embezzlement charges against him. Judge Brown finds him guilty of embezzling money, and sentenences him to pay a large fine and serve a minimum of 18 months in prison. Catching a glimpse of Ruth on his way out of the courtroom for the first time in months, Bob begs her to help him, but she has no sympathy. Ruth can now cross off \"career\" and \"freedom\" off her list, putting an end to her reign of terror. \"Poor Bob\", Ruth says in a voice-over. \"I almost felt sorry for him... almost.\" The film then flashes forward to one year later. Ruth is visiting Bob in prison with the kids. She drops the kids off but before she can leave, Bob asks her if he can come over one night and cook her dinner when he gets out in another six or seven months. Ruth tells him that would be nice, and that she'll think about it. Bob asks Nichollete and Andy to taste some cookies he made in the prison kitchen and they burned, echoing Ruth's burned clam puffs. After the events with Bob, Mary sells her mansion. Her new book is called \"Trust and Betrayal: A Docu-novel of Love, Money and Skepticism,\" proves to be a critical and commercial success; Ruth appears at the book signing and asks the autograph to be made out to \"Ruth\", which causes Mary to give a momentary lapse of deja vu (considering that she never actually met Ruth face-to-face throughout the movie), but she shrugs it off. Next in line after Ruth is a handsome Frenchman whom Mary flirts with, showing that she is back to her old ways. In the closing shot, Ruth is shown walking down the street in the World Trade Center neighborhood, wearing current styles and her hair nicely done, surrounded by women wearing the Vesta Rose agency pin they received upon joining Ruth's \"army.\" Breaking the fourth wall, Ruth looks at the camera and smiles... seemingly satisfied with the sweet revenge she devilishly duked out on Bob and Mary's faces.",

         "Reading the comments for this film, two aspects appear as the concentration to the films perceived flaws. The one is a lack of sympathy for Roseanne's character, Ruth. The other is a lack of appreciation for Meryl Streep's performance. Having watched this film many times since it's release, I think I can safely dispute this argument. This film certainly I feel has all the markings of a cult favorite. It's dark humor, over charged performances as well as the overall look and feel wedges it someplace between \"Heathers\" and \"Ruthless People\". More on the nuances that I feel set this film apart from others later, but lets first deal with the Roseann/Streep problem. Quite frankly, I see no problem. Meryl Streep's Mary Fisher is one of the screens funniest inventions. It seems quite clear to me that she enjoyed playing this role because there is no other way such a wonderful performance could have been created. On a number of occasions, there are lengthy shots with no change of camera where she drives through a range of hilarious emotions. How she handles a scene involving a dog licking her feet while she awakes is tremendous. I feel it is one of her strongest performances; she never turns it off, and always delivers it in the correct dosage. The issue with Roseanne's character, Ruth, is she is seen as manipulative, uncaring, a monster hell bent on revenge. Ruth, like everything else in this picture is a caricature. This is very much the sort of role we would expect from Roseanne, the domestic goddess taking it all a step further. True, she does wallow in a mean spirited negativity, but it results in a positive outcome for nearly all involved. She takes control of her life and liberates Linda Hunts Nurse Hopper as well as countless women through her Vespa Rose Employment Agency. She returns life to the geriatrics in her care at a nursing home. As a result of Ruth's revenge, Mary Fisher at last becomes recognized as the serious writer she wished to from the start. We even know that Begley's Bob Patchett gets his comeuppance, and accepts it with grace and humility. There are dozens of touches brought here which make this a movie so enjoyable to watch. Firstly, there is the remarkable physical change in many of the characters as the story progresses. Roseanne goes from looking like a reject from a freak show to a rather zaftig Joan Collins. Linda Hunt and Sylvia Miles likewise transform, and Streep goes from a pink, frosted confection of a romance novelist, to a black turtle necked, bespectacled writer with a gift for the \"post modern metaphor\". A certain tone is set when the establishing shot of Mary Fisher \"pink palace by the sea\" reveals her initials, M F, emblazoned on the massive gate. Streep is given countless occasions to do great business for the camera, as in a scene where her complete lack of comprehension in doing laundry leads her to put half a gallon of bleach and several dryer sheets in a washing machine. Best of all, she manages to give the finger to the \"serious critics\" while on the Sally Jesse Raphale Show. I honestly don't feel this film is as bad as many would like one to think. If you sit back, and let it unfold as I believe it was intended to, you will find a clever picture that has just the correct amount of overarched villainy and cynicism as many of our favorite black comedies.",
         "This movie is not serious at all. That's the funniest part! This movie is absolutely among my comedy favorites. Perhaps it was a bit ahead of it's time, I think - everyone should take a look at it again and have a laugh. As a European I must say that it is ever so refreshing with a movie with such a black humor to it. The fact that everything is over the top makes it not less attractive, but brings the so-called \"authenticity\" of this story to an extend of fun, fun, fun. It is beyond \"real\" - it is there to amuse you and so it does. This movie is sarcastic, even to itself and indeed to the Fay Weldon novel that lies behind it. Roseanne stars in her very best role ever as the ugly and poor Ruth Patchett who reveals herself as a superheroine in the vengeance department. To cast Roseanne in this role is a brilliant idea. She is obviously not afraid of being the most repulsive woman ever seen on video, and that only contributes to the laughs as she turns from the bearded lady into a business woman with a hard grip on her own destiny. Roseanne has always been accused of being a bad actress. I am not saying that she is a good one, but perhaps the character Ruth has a lot of Roseanne inside her - because her work here is in any way magnificent. Meryl Streep on the other hand is absolutely faboulos. She has tried a few time to enter the world of comedy, most notably with the bizarre \"Death Becones Her\", but this might be her very best try in the genre. As the pink queen of romance, the Barbara Cartland of her generation, you might add, she sparkles with hysteria and selfconsciousness. Her Mary Fisher does make one of the funniest breakdowns as her \"Love in the Rinse Cycle\" fails as well as her relationship with Robert Patchett, Ruth's husband. Streep has the elegance that it takes to be - well, pink - but she is not afraid of tearing it down and plays the role with much physical courage. Academy Award Winner Linda Hunt as always also makes a great appearance as Ruth's partner-in-crime Nurse Hooper. Along with Roseanne and Meryl Streep she benefits from her physical appearance, and all three of them changes as women in a very convincing way. For Linda Hunt, cookies does the trick, and her change from dry, bitter and hardworking to giggling business woman is very amusing indeed. Finally I must say that the cinematography and editing of this movie is outstanding, as well as the musical contribution, e.g. the opening titles and the introduction of Ruth - it sure does follow the general irony of the story in a great way. Along with the extremely well-put dialogue this movie simply is - hilarious.",
         "I will admit from the outset that I have a soft spot for the trio of Seidelman films made in the mid-80's and early 90's-- Desperately Seeking Susan, Making Mr. Right, and this film. There is something playful and quite outrageous about all three of the aforementioned movies with She Devil being the funniest due to great performances by the entire cast, even Roseanne Barr. Although this movie was disregarded by most critics and ignored at the box office, it is truly a funny film with its cartoon-like situations and over-the-top characters. Regardless of what everyone says, check out this film, especially when you find yourself in the mood for a cute and campy movie that is reminiscent of some of the great comedies of the 80's, such as Ruthless People.",
         "Meryl Streep (Mary Fisher), \"Out of Africa\",'85 put her heart and soul into this role and proved to her many fans that she is a great actress who can even play comedy and make it work. Roseanne Barr(Ruth Patchett), \"Blue in the Face\",'95, performs as an ugly housewife who is abused beyond words by Bob, her husband, (Ed Begley,Jr.),\"Auto Focus\",'02. Bob plays a horrible husband who deserves just what he gets from the SHE-DEVIL! If you love Meryl Streep and Roseanne, just sit back and enjoy this CRAZY film and forget about your troubles.",
         "In a nutshell-this is another first wives club and fans of that movie will probebly appreciate this one which actually cam eout quite a bit before fwc. It's another woman scorned movie but I enjoyed it actually a bit more then wives club due to the fact it didn't drag. First wives club though it was the ultimate \"watch in a group of women movie\" had some moments where my attention wandered. This was very much a caricature movie but it was good dark comedy and boy was it funny to see Meryl in a role like this!",
         "She-Devil bedevils you!! Roseanne Barr is not one of my favorite thespians, but this under-rated little movie simply RAWKS!! Roseanne Barr is married to Bob Pratchett. He is a hard-working accountant who is skimming the little gratuities from his clients; the newest of which is Mary Fischer. With a huge \"MF\" on her front gate, she is the top fantasy/romance novelist in the country. With Ms. Fischer's mother in a \"retirement home,\" and Bob spending all his time with his new lover, Mary, Ruth Pratchett has a lot of time on her hands. She has vowed to take care of their children, their home, and do her best to hold her head up in the community. When Bob's parents come to dinner, and it turns into a total disaster, Bob begins to berate his loving and faithful wife, who slowly begins to unravel at the seams, right there before our eyes. During his tirade, Bob makes the fatal mistake of listing his life's assets. 1. home 2. family 3. career 4. freedom He walks out on his loving wife, and moves in with Mary Fischer. Ruth, in a state of shock, then sets out upon her plot. She blows up their home, takes the kids to Bob, obtains employment in the retirement home where Mary Fischer's mother resides, and begins giving her vitamins instead of sedatives. She then helps Mrs. Fischer to the bus for a surprise visit with her daughter, and arranges things so that the elderly Fischer is unable to return to the retirement home. So Bob is now deprived of his house, has an over-abundance of family and his career and freedom are next on the agenda. This is a wonderful \"getting even\" movie for all those of you who have been there; done that. While Roseanne is not exactly the shining star of stage and screen, she is more than adequate in her role as Ruth Pratchett, wife and mother; and in her title role as \"She-Devil,\" the personification of a marriage gone wrong. Maria Pitillo is delightful as the naively sweet but ruthlessly ambitious Olivia Honey. Olivia is Bob's new lover. And nothing cools the flames of passion like a mistress who behaves like a wife. So Bob, while still very hungry for Mary's money, is now on to bustier things. But he neglects to tell Ms. Honey of his relationship with Mary, and when they find out about one another, all bets are off. If you liked her as Audrey Timmonds in \"Godzilla,\" 1998, you will thoroughly enjoy her performance in this zany vehicle. I love this quirky little \"B\" movie, and watch it often. It gets a 8.9/10 from... the Fiend :.",
         "I liked this film. It's a dark comedy about revenge. Apparently it was a star vehicle for Roseanne, and I thought she performed well enough. Meryl Streep really sank her teeth into this role, probably a lot of fun for her, after so many tragic, accented heroines. True, the special(??!!) effects shot of Roseanne walking away from the exploding house was awful, but it was so bad that I wonder if it might have been intentional. If so, I can't understand why, though. One gaping plot hole. Ed Begley, Jr. As an average-looking guy (OK, below average-looking) I can tell you that Begley is not the sort of man that the Meryl Streeps/Mary Fishers of the world fall for on first meeting. Anyway the film is cute. Not great by any means, but worth a viewing.",
         "My goodness, all the negativity about this fun and strangely satisfying flick. Everyone I know really likes this movie and has seen it several times. If we can define how good a film is by how many times we're capable of seeing it, then this movie certainly is praise worthy. I also enjoyed Roseanne's performance every bit as Meryl Streep. And why can't people believe that an actress of Ms. Streep's caliber took on this role? She was wonderful and got to demonstrate a great comedic performance. This movie is just plain fun. If you watch it once, I guarantee you'll watch it again and again.",
         "She-Devil was trumped-up as Roseanne Barr's movie debut!In just a few years our favorite chubby housewife rose from being a stand-up comic performing in bars to having her own TV series and at last co-starring in a major motion picture with the immortal Meryl Streep!The movie itself is rather silly and farfetched!Roseanne is essentially playing herself as a put-apon housewife! But the real surprise is Meryl Streep! She delivers a searing,self-mocking performance as narcissisitic romance novelist Mary Fisher.She plays this role flawlessly!! As a prissy,bluenose diva she reacts hilariously to every twist and turn of the movie's silly storyline!Actually mocking every role she's played before!Roseanne holds her own nicely-but it would't have been possible without Meryl Streep!!",
         "So cool that Rosanne's name in the movie was RUTH! Do you know what that means --- the common noun \"ruth\"? I thought this movie was really funny. Not a great, mind you. Not a classic. I am not lamenting the fact that it got no Oscars. But I am deploring its abysmally low rating on imdb. I just don't get it."
