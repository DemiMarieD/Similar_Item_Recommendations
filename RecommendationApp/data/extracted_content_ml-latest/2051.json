         "'Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo' is a fun movie, and that is all it is meant to be. Some have said that it is not nearly as good as 'The Love Bug,' but let's face it: none of the Herbie films are about great brilliance. They are all about having fun and getting a laugh. The kids and I really enjoyed it. It is great to see Dean Jones again, and he plays Jim Douglas as someone who knows, understands, and even loves Herbie. My only criticism of this film is that it lacks Buddy Hackett. Still, Don Knotts is a wonderful replacement. On a four-star rating system, I give this one ***. Come to think of it, that is about what I would rate 'The Love Bug.' The DVD of 'Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo' does not feature any extras, but there are plenty on the 'Love Bug' set, certainly enough to cover both films. Funny stuff, and loads of fun!",
         "When you think about Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo raises some interesting philosophical questions. Such as how is the sex of a car determined? Are here certain part variations as there are with animals or is the sex determined by the owner? You won't get the answer to these questions, but with Dean Jones as racing driver Jim Douglas back at the steering wheel you will get a reasonably fun movie from the Disney Studio. This is the third Herbie film from the Magic Kingdom and it lives up to the standard created by the first one. Jones after giving the car over to the tender care of Helen Hayes in the second film is back at the wheel, this time with Don Knotts instead of Buddy Hackett as his mechanic. Though I like Knotts very much as a performer, something was definitely missing without Buddy Hackett in the film. You'd have to have seen the first to appreciate it, but Hackett was the first to discover the true essence of Herbie, the Volkwagen with a soul. Dean and Don have several problems to overcome. The first is a pair of inept jewel thieves who nearly get themselves caught even with all the museum layout and security systems information. To avoid capture Bernard Fox and Roy Kinnear dump one very large diamond into Herbie's gas tank before the Grand Prix race from Paris to Monte Carlo. The second is an officious German driver who apparently well remembers that Volkswagen's were not vehicles of sport from the Third Reich. Eric Braeden is one of those Germans you just love to hate. The final problem is Herbie who takes one look at the lines on the car Julie Sommars is driving and guess what, her car has a soul as well. I guess you needed a handsome, devilish may car, rogue like Herbie to bring it out. He also of course brings Julie and Dean together, though I do have to wonder what happened with Michele Lee from the original film. Nice location scenery of France, the countryside and the metropolitan areas of Paris and Monte Carlo definitely help one enjoy this film even if you're not a devoted fan of the soulful Herbie.",
         "Although the movie is quite old, the special effects are obvious and the cgi non-existent, this is one of the best family-movies ever. The story is simple, two thieves have hidden a diamond in a race-car which is now competing in the Trans-France Race, but it isn't your usual VW. And who is this mysterious Mister X? The scenes where Herbie and the Lancia meet are unforgettable, the two thieves are pretty much the comic relief, the love interest Diane has some pretty sharp edges, and the racing against the German and the French guy adds another point of tension to it. The low rate for this movie surprised me. I thought it was a very good movie, with action, nice characters, humour, and some good fun. 8/10",
         "Herbie goes to Monte Carlo is my first favorite \"Herbie\" film. My favorite scenes were: The scene when the diamond thieves are chasing Herbie through the French country side and my other favorite scene was when Dean Jones and Don Knotts got into a fight with the diamond thieves. The whole movie is funny but I thought those were the funniest scenes. Don Knotts is hilarious as usual, just like on the \"Andy Griffith\" show. A cute scene I liked was when Herbie was taking a shower from the splashing water of a big fountain.",
         "Love Bug's third entry in which Herbie is racing in the Monte Carlo Rally , it is full of pranks and car stunts that are great fun to see . Agreeable Disney's love bug Wolkswagen plenty of action , slapstick , laughs and fun . This hilarious Herbie story concerns about The Love Bug falls 'hood-over-wheels' for a classy chassis! Herbie, the Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own undertakes the famous international car race but encountering all sorts of comical obstacles along the way . Unbeknownst to Herbie's driver thieves (Ron Kinnear, Bernard Fox) have hidden a cache of stolen diamond in the gas tank . So the thieves resort to all manner of traps , legal or otherwise, to get it and are now attempting to get them back . There is one obstacle however : Herbie and a French Police Inspector (Jacques Marin) is investigating the robbing . Fortunately, the couple of pilots (Dean Jones, Don Knotts) have a sleeve in the form of Herbie , the fantastic car , as they takes the magical Wolkswagen Bug with a mind of its own . The VW falls in love with a sports car, a Lancia , as both of them compete in the notorious race . Miraculous Herbie take them for a ride and stumbles into evil hoodlums who pursue through roads , highways and race tracks . As always, Herbie the love bug , is helping the young couple (Dean Jones ,Julie Sommars) find romance but encountering all sorts of hilarious problems along the way . Meanwhile Herbie with the number 53 intervenes in the biggest race cars from Paris to Monte Carlo and win the Grand Prize , a challenge among top competitors circle the world's most famous racing circuits and quickly slipping in the ranking. This ordinary Disney slapdash film displays great loads of amusement , fun , giggles , race cars and is pretty entertaining . It's an enjoyable movie for kids and for those who enjoy cars racing round and round and bounds and leaps by Herbie . The actors seem to enjoy immensely , as Dean Jones and Don Knotts play of sympathetic manner and the mean-spirited villains performed by Ron Kinnear , Bernard Fox and Jacques Marin are top notch . Brief appearance as sympathetic waiter by Gerard Jugnot subsequently prestigious player in the successful ¨The choir boys ¨. Colorful cinematography by Leonard South and jolly soundtrack by Frank De Vol including the lively leitmotif , usual in the Herbie's series. This is a delightful film , the original film turns out to be : ¨The love bug¨ (1969) by Robert Stevenson with Dean Jones, Michele Lee and Buddy Hackett , followed by ¨ Herbie rides again (1974)¨ also by Robert Stevenson and starred by Ken Berry , Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes ; it's followed by ¨Herbie goes to Montecarlo¨ and ¨Herbie goes bananas¨ (1980 , or Herbie Torero) by Vincent McEveety starred by Charles Martin Smith and Cloris Leachman , among others and a 1997-for-television-movie and a TV series , the most part filmed by Stevenson and Vincent McEveety and usually starred by Dean Jones . Furthermore recent version starred by Linsay Lohan , Justin Long and Matt Dillon , being directed by Angela Robinson. This \" Herbie goes to Monte Carlo¨ version is amusing and with lots of laughs but is a familiar film . The motion picture is correctly directed by Vincent McEveety . Worthwhile seeing , typical Disney slapstick ,it's a great fun to watch and there are loads of entertainment in this one . It' one of the best and funniest of ¨Herbie¨ series .",
         "It has been twelve years since Jim Douglas last won a race; in fact, it has been twelve years since he last drove a race but he has selected the prodigious France-Monte Carlo race to make their come back. Being greeted with laughter is a problem they can overcome but when Herbie falls in love with a rival car it means that he is distracted and more interesting in impressing her than giving his all. Mind you, even if they manage to get over that problem Jim and Wheely don't even know about the stolen diamond in their fuel tank or the international thieves chasing them to get it back. Herbie films have never been about high production standards, character or plot and this entry in the series is no exception. The plot mixes one thread about a jewel robbery and another about romance. The former is the more enjoyable strand but it doesn't do enough to get the most out of it because it focuses more on the romance side of things. In regards Herbie, this at least provides some scenes that kids will find funny with the two cars, however it also brings tiresome bits between Douglas and Diane Darcy that aren't fun at all. It all does what you expect it to in all regards and there isn't anything special here but most of it is amusing and inoffensive enough for adults to watch while also being broad, visual and silly enough to keep children content. Dean Jones is happy to mug along as usual and he does it well enough to fit the mood of the film; likewise Knotts pulls faces and gurns as much as he possibly can. Sommars is really rather annoying and has as little character as her character's ugly and charisma-lacking car. Herbie is amusing as ever and the film does well to draw a character out of the car without resorting to the cheap effects used by the modern entry. Overall this is not a great film but it is an enjoyable kids movie and should be viewed as such. It is delivered with consistent good humour even if it has no surprises or laughs to really speak of. Adults might get bored of it easily but are unlikely to be annoyed by it, while children should be amused and distracted by the inoffensive antics.",
         "If you thought Herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'The Love Bug' was daft, wait until you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel. Dean Jones is back as the driver competing in the Paris to Monte Carlo rally; this time his sentient VW falls in love with another car in the race, a Lancia driven by Julie Sommars. By this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in 'Herbie Rides Again'; the movie is overlong and threadbare, although it's watchable thanks to a few funny bits, the cast's frantic mugging, and the return of Jones, who turns in a typically likable performance.",
         "Vincent McEveety took over directing duties on this third \"Herbie\" film that sees Dean Jones return as Jim Douglas, who has regained possession of Herbie, and has entered a Paris to Monte Carlo road race with help from his friend Wheely Applegate(played by Don Knotts). Trouble starts when jewel thieves hide a stolen jewel in Herbie's gas tank(located in a spot never seen before or since!) Herbie has also fallen in love with a light-blue Lancia car also in the race, which is a distraction Jim didn't need... Nice to see Dean Jones return, though the unexplained absence of both Buddy Hackett and Michele Lee is annoying. Really no better or worse than the previous film, with equally silly plot elements.",
         "For Herbie's third cinematic outing, there is a real sense of desperation and wondering how much more they can do with a car that thinks for itself. Credit where it's due - it is not as bad as \"Herbie Rides Again\" and you can see that they have learnt some lessons. But the trouble is, a long time had passed since the original \"Love Bug\" and the world was suddenly a different place. The Swinging Sixties had been forgotten about and Vietnam was still going on, meaning that Herbie had a lot to do to recapture that feel-good factor and sadly, it can't quite manage it. This time Herbie is reunited with racing car driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones), who with his mechanic Wheely Applegate (Don Knotts), have crossed the Atlantic to participate in the Paris-Monte Carlo rally. Despite being mocked by their fellow competitors and upsetting fiery redhead Diane Darcy (Julie Sommars), Jim and Wheely become unwittingly embroiled in a jewel theft when the thieves (Roy Kinnear and Bernard Fox) plant the diamond in Herbie's gas tank. So as our heroes set off to Monte Carlo, they are pursued by the thieves as well as the police, led by Inspector Bouchet (Jacques Marin) and his overly-excited partner Detective Fontenoy (Xavier Saint-Macary). I'm happy to report that Herbie is racing again, as he should be instead of fending off unscrupulous property developers on behalf of little old ladies. Jones back behind the wheel is also a plus, although his relationship with Knotts feels a little odd. The lack of a romantic subplot between Jones and Sommars is instead replaced by a romance (if you can call it that) between Herbie and a beat-up, garishly painted Lancia but this is little more than a time-filling distraction. The racing scenes are the best, even if the action is sped up and filmed in southern California instead of France - even the qualifying race for the rally is obviously filmed at Laguna Seca! There are other problems too - the baddies don't really offer much of a threat although the German driver Von Stickle (Eric Braeden) is a moustache-twiddle away from being Dick Dastardly. The comedy also feels quite forced and not especially funny, highlighted by Knotts who is a poor imitation of the sorely missed Buddy Hackett. Even Herbie's jaunty theme music is missing and the whole thing feels not just dated but sedated as well. It's not often I find a film dull but sadly, \"Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo\" ticks that box. While not as bad as \"Herbie Rides Again\", this film reinforces my fears that there is only so much you can do with a car that has a mind of its own (not that any of the characters say such things, as if they're embarrassed to do so). I was fearful of watching the three sequels to \"The Love Bug\" after the first was such a disappointment but this is an improvement. It's a perfectly acceptable family movie but it never gets into its stride, being quite content to rumble along in neutral until it crosses the finishing line 105 minutes later. It feels out-of-date and out-of-touch, even at the time it was first released. Now all I have to do is hope for the best when \"Herbie Goes Bananas\"...",
         "Even Disney are guilty of the cash cow disease, after the roaring success of The Love Bug in 1968, the house of mouse cashed in with Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo, and Herbie Goes Bananas. Neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of The Love Bug back in 68, in this one we find race driver Jim Douglas and his sidekick Wheely Applegate, entering Herbie in the Monte Carlo Rally. Naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car!. The car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is. Still you get to see Herbie take a bath, foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life, so something there for everyone i think....................4/10."
