      "reviews": [
         "The only reason I watched this movie is because I found out that my favorite local Talk Radio host was in it (I live in Nashville, where it was filmed). He played the defense attorney, and I'm sorry to say he was one of the worst actors in the movie (and that's saying a lot, considering how bad the acting was throughout). It's a good thing he's a good radio host. I guess they tried to save money by using local talent, but talent really isn't the right word. The plot had an interesting twist, but it wasn't enough to save this dog of a movie. I can't believe I even sat through it, and I wasted a spot in my Netflix queue for this.",
         "A Letter from Death Row has the plot depth and acting skills of a rock video, which should come as no surprise since former Poison lead singer Bret Michaels is the lead actor, writer, director, co-producer and songwriter. While Death Row would probably be placed in the mystery/thriller genre, it's not thrilling at all, and the only real mystery is why Martin and Charlie Sheen would agree to appear in this movie at all. Don't be fooled by the tape cover, though Martin Sheen has second billing in the credits, he appears in one inconsequential scene for about 90 seconds. The rest of the acting is wooden; the defense lawyer in particular looks like he's reading cue cards. We do not care about any of the characters, and by the end of the movie the plot is totally dismissed as well. This is not one of those \"so bad you have to see it\" movies, unless you're a Poison fan.",
         "Now and then the movie almost has a chance but it basically falls flat. The plot is generic and the acting is poor. Even for an indie film it doesn't measure up.",
         "This is, or should have been, the vanity project to end all vanity projects. The plastic-boobed strippers in thongs, the pointless camera effects, the pointless strange angles, chapter titles, in fact continual titles, continual voice-over, cheesy music (natch, he's from Poison), average (being kind)-to-poor acting, awkward exposition...if you've had a smoke and a drink it's hilarious, otherwise it's about a 1:4:4 solution of mildly amusing, irritating and boring. Just like me. (I was going to rate it higher than a 1 because I'm nice like that but the IMDb definition of 1 is \"awful\", and I can't argue with that really.)",
         "When I first heard and read that the lead singer of Poison was staring in a movie I just had to see it. I kept checking the newspapers hoping that it would be showing in one of them but much to my disappointment it didn't. When I became a member of Netflix the movie A Letter From Death Row was my first choice. Not only did Bret write the music for his first time acting but was also Written by, Directed by, Produced by, did his own stunts and from what I have heard and read in interviews he did more behind the scenes work as well. Most people see him as a 80s hair metal rock star, but IMO Bret Michaels is a modern day Renaissance Man. I really hope he not only continues his music career but continues doing other side projects as well!",
         "Has everybody forgotten that this man was the lead singer of Poison? This could be \"Citizen Cain\" and it would suck anyway on general principle. What the heck was Martin Sheen thinking. A long fall from \"Apocolyse Now\", that is for sure. Bret Michaels acting? Maybe he should spend more time getting better at singing before he quits his day job. Something to believe in? The electric chair.",
         "What can I say, it was awful. Basically you have the pop star, the single famous actor (Martin Sheen for about 90 secs) and a script that actually takes itself seriously. There was a twist in the tale, however, you could see it coming about 10 minutes into the film, and to be honest by the end I just didn't care. Sorry, but cannot think of any redeeming feature",
         "Did he actually do it? All through the whole movie he presumed innocence. But then the end was very tricky. He had me confused. Talking to himself, or so the guards said. Plus he got himself confused. I love Bret Michaels so I hope it wasn't him they fried at the end of the movie. Very good movie. Hope everyone can enjoy it. I know I did. Found out a few things I most definitely didn't know, so at least I learned something from it as well. Some very bad murder plots in it as well. One of those 'You're gonna get caught no matter what you do...' but you'll find that out if you watch it. Over all it had a good plot line & a wonderful lead actor who is one of those no one wants to see die, I know I didn't.",
         "All in all it was a okay picture. I didn't care to much for it but I can see how some people could. As for Bret Michaels I really don't like his music but this story was alright. It could have worked if they hired some better actors and changed a couple things in the screenplay. For the directing I thought it wasn't too good but there was a couple creative things I did like. Everybody said it had many twists and turns but in my opinion I thought it was pretty predicable, but I guess thats just me. It was okay and I didn't mind seeing it once.",
         "This movie is worst than the turkey itself. The videocover actually has Charlie Sheen on it. He is only shown for a couple seconds. This movie just like watching an overlong horrible rock video. At one time in cinema, Movies actually had actors & actress worth of being great stars, today film-makers go out and get any music, sports, or just anybody, stick in front of camera, and call it movie. That irritates me so much, to see actor&actress who work from dawn til dusk just to make ends meet, but instead just throws somebody in front of camera. If more movies be like this in future there would be no reason to watch them."
