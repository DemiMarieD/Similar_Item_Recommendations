         "Wayne's World is a silly yet utterly hilarious look at two dimwits (based on they're SNL skit Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) who have their own public access TV show called \"Waynes World\". The story thickens to a nice touch with Rob Lowe as a big time hot-shot who wants to bring their show to big heights. Tia Carrere has never been hotter as the woman who Wayne wants and \"we'll be mine\". Many sight gags, many good lines, and probably all quotable, this movie (like Myers' Austin Powers) belongs in a place in comedy film history. A++",
         "Ask most men within a decade of my age in either direction to list the 100 best movie scenes of all time, and the scene from \"Wayne's World\" where they sing/lip sync Bohemian Rhapsody in the car will be on more lists than not. It might even make every list. Not designed for the \"critically acclaimed\" snob set, Wayne's World, the film adaptation of the extremely popular Saturday Night Live skit by the same name, targets its audience perfectly and never even enters the water, let alone jumps any sharks. The movie is true to itself from start to finish. The bedrock of the film, as well as the skit, is the unbending friendship of Wayne and Garth. Most children have one best friend who stands out above all others, and there's no mistaking that Wayne (SNL alum Mike Myers) and Garth (SNL alum Dana Carvey) have that type of friendship. The best friends host a cable access show in Aurora, Illinois, also sharing the skit's title. Other SNL alums, such as Brian Doyle-Murray (Noah) and Chris Farley (a concert security guard), round out the cast. The plot centers around an opportunistic television producer named Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe), who, with funding from an arcade owner, turns Wayne's World into a slickly produced national show, causing it to lose touch with its audience, and causing friction between Wayne and Garth, who feel they have sold out their fans and their roots. A love interest is tossed to Wayne in the form of Cassandra (Tia Carerre), in triangular form due to the attention paid to her by Kane as well as Wayne. The pop-culture cuisinart responsible for most of the SNL skits was working in overdrive in this film, and that's a good thing. Everything from product placements, to gratuitous sex, to lame plot devices were lampooned. Rob Lowe was excellent as the sleazeball junior television executive, while cameos abound from the rock world, including Alice Cooper and Meat Loaf. Though not publicized as much as the other quotables from the movie, my personal favorite scene was when Wayne and Garth were each laying on parked cars, and Garth starts whistling the closing theme from Star Trek. SNL-based movies have been hit-or-miss since their inception, but this was unquestionably a hit.",
         "The cultural references of Wayne's World may date it a bit, but the nature and personality of its humor set it apart. There is a kind of naive benevolence and boundless joy which makes this movie so lovable. Its aimless plot and exaggerated humor are cute, without ever transcending that barrier into maudlin sentiment. This is a difficult mix to achieve, especially when so many comedians go out of their way to achieve \"street credibility\" through as much forced vulgarity and stereotypical humor as possible. Campbell and Carvey's characters were the ultimate comedic anti-heroes for generation X, even more so than Jay and Silent Bob, Bill and Ted, or Beavis and Butthead. They championed amateurism, paraded self-affecting humor, and became worshiped for telling everyone they weren't worthy. If '60s pop culture encouraged people to \"do your own thing,\" Wayne and Garth were the genuine article in the '90s. Two complete geeks had fun acting as themselves, and became celebrated in the process. One of the true comedy classics of our time. 8.5/10",
         "WAYNE'S WORLD is actually one of the best SNL-inspired comedies ever made. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are way cool as Wayne and Garth. It's just shameful that the movie contains mostly wasted music...HYUH, RIGHT, if monkeys fly out of my butt. I think it the music here is excellent. Tia Carerre is hot as Wayne's love interest, and Rob Lowe does a fine job as the con artist who buys Wayne and Garth's show. Believe me, it's worthy. 4 out of 5",
         "Remember how wildly popular this one was when it came out? \"Wayne's World\" didn't completely live up to all of the hype, but it's not a bad little comedy. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are great as Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar, co-hosts of a basement-based cable access show. The duo seem to have it made when their show hits the commercial airwaves, but there might just be something sinister behind it all with executive Benjamin Kane (Rob Lowe) in charge. \"Wayne's World\" is not generally uproarious, but it certainly has its moments (the backstage scene with Alice Cooper, portraying the leather-clad rocker and his bandmates as political sophisticates, is hilarious). Myers' act wears a bit thin as the film proceeds, and the \"serious\" stretch in which Wayne seemingly loses his girlfriend and best friend just doesn't fit. But even when it's not funny, \"Wayne's World\" is usually reasonably entertaining and charming. Carvey's bizarre Garth is one of the highlights, along with some memorable parodies and writing. Based on the popular \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, \"Wayne's World\" is definite period piece of the early 1990s. Its catchphrases (\"... not!\" and \"Schwing!\" among them) were repeated millions of times over by teenagers. It spawned a less-successful sequel, and although there was talk of a third installment, it's almost a certainty we've seen the last of Wayne and Garth. Nevertheless, party on!",
         "I saw Waynes world ten years ago and I still find it funny even now.It is about two airheads who run their own TV show and don't get anything for it..They are soon visited by a businessman who exploits them for the show. Waynes world even after ten years I still find it funny.It spoofs so many things and it just makes me laugh.It also has a good storyline to play along with.I reccomend watching Waynes world and the sequel in one night to see what you think. You will enjoy it.I rate 4/5.",
         "Penelope Spheeris (also of the Decline of Western Civilization Series and Suburbia) was chosen as the director of Mike Myers and Dana Carvey's SNL creation. This is the film that catapulted both comedians' careers into the stratosphere. 1992 is an interesting time in alternative rock history between the peak of grunge in 1991, and the coming crest of the \"punk revival\" in 1994 with Green Day, Offspring and Rancid. Wayne's World reveled in this new \"alternative rock,\" music a concept which was at the time much more flexible than it is now. Rife with irony, alternative rock was eventually the name given to the music that blended aspects of rock, metal, punk, pop, and eclectic \"weirdness.\" While Wayne is the more metal half of the excellent duo, Garth is the grunge/nerd/\"punk\" side of the equation. Heavy metal rock and roll fandom provides the backdrop for a non-stop train wreck of social satire. Only in 1992; and only in Meyer's and Carvey's comedic genius could Aurora, Illinois ever seem so cool. Wayne's World, in the film's plot, is the name of a Cable Access television show (dare I say \"DIY\") hosted by Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. Rob Lowe plays Benjamin, an advertising scout/producer who is looking for talent to promote a chain of video game arcade stores. He finds his muse in the low-brow witticism, promptly signs the boys, and sets them up in a proper television studio. A battle ensues between Ben and Wayne for the affection of one way-hot Cassandra (Tia Carrere) who is easily lured away from Wayne at the first flourish of Benjamin's bountiful extravagance. Wayne and Garth's plans to win back Cassandra culminate in the film's tripartite finale. \"...with an underlying revisionist's conceit that belied the film's emotional attachments to the subject matter...\" the film was truly entertaining, whimsical, and relevant. And to reassure Garth; No, it did not suck.",
         "While Mike Myers may be better known for Austin Powers and Shrek, 'Wayne's World' was the film that really brought his comedic genius to the mainstream public. Originally a Saturday Night Live sketch about Wayne (Myers) and Garth (the underrated Dana Carvey) about two friends who start a public access cable TV show in their basement, it's one of the best (if not the best) SNL-to-film adaptations ever. While the plot is fairly simple, where WW really shines is its clever humour. It highlights and subverts the rules of film narrative, something Myers carried over into Austin Powers, a trait which is lacking in the more predictable comedies of today (especially the awful \"parody\" films). Wayne and Garth talk directly to camera (which only they are allowed to do), there's blatant product placement, pop culture parodies, guest appearances, the famous Bohemian Rhapsody headbanging scene and funny alternate endings. Top that off with the slew of silly jokes and endlessly quotable lines (including one of the first uses of the phrase \"that's what she said\"), and you have a film which \u0096 even nearly twenty years later \u0096 still strikes a chord with viewers, regardless of their age. Even towards the end, when the need to wrap up the story cleanly can ruin many comedies, 'Wayne's World' still retains its sense of humour, a prime example being Wayne's \"Oscar winning\" speech to win back Cassandra (Tia Carrere). If you feel like a laugh or want to relive some memories, then you could do far worse than check out 'Wayne's World'. Excellent.",
         "Back in the early 90's, Saturday Night Live was brought back to life with a great cast. Among them were Mike Myers and Dana Carvey who created some of the most memorable characters Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. A bunch of Saturday Night Live movies were released, some were gigantic hits like Blues Brothers and some were misses Coneheads(which I loved by the way). Wayne's World was nothing on Saturday Night Live but two stoners who just ragged on things, how could you make it into a full feature length film? Not only did Penelope Spheeris do it, she knocked it out of the ball park with Wayne's World. It's one of the funniest movies that you could ever see with one of the most memorable scenes in comedy history making \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen shoot back up to number one on the charts. Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar are the hosts of Wayne's World in Aurora, Illinois, where they ogle pictures of beautiful celebrity women, play air guitar and drums, and interview local people, indirectly making fun of them over. One day Benjamin, a television station executive, when he finds out how many people watch the show, he instructs his producer Russell Finley to find out where the show is taped, telling him they may have an opportunity for a huge sponsorship. Benjamin shows up next week in Wayne's basement and introduces himself after the show ends. He offers to buy the rights to the show and to keep Wayne and Garth on for what he describes as a \"huge\" salary. Little do they know that they are about to be sold out. The cast had this absolutely amazing chemistry that made this film work in all the right places adding new characters with Tia Carrere, Rob Lowe, and Kurt Fuller. I love this scene where Wayne and his girlfriend Cassandra go into a music store and he starts the riff on the guitar playing Led Zepplin's song \"Stairway to Heaven\" and the sales associate points to the sign that says \"No Stairway to Heaven\", thank you for that message! I love Wayne's reaction to it as well \"No Stairway? Denied!\", too funny. Also they meet Alice Cooper, who I met as a little girl, and he is one of the most intelligent people you could meet in real life and I loved how they captured it in this movie showing that Alice is a character, in real life he's incredibly intelligent, gentle and cool. He tells Wayne and Garth to hang with them and they just get down on their knees screaming \"We're not worthy!\" and he leans his hand out so they could kiss it! I nearly died laughing at the scene where the T2 pulls Wayne over showing him the picture of John Conner \"Have you seen this boy?\". I loved the multiple endings. There isn't a thing I would change with this movie, it's a great comedy that is just guaranteed to make you laugh till your sides hurt. I highly recommend it, it's party time. 9/10",
         "Once upon a time in Aurora (Illinois), in a modest basement : \"Wayne's World! Wayne's World! Party On! Excellent!\" \"Extreme close up\" \"Waaaaaaah\" \u0085 Ahhh,.. \"Wayne's World\", as one of its several number-one fans, I have so many things to say that I really don't know how to handle it. Well, how about the mega-pompous over-insightfully wannabe Ebert approach, with a nostalgic and teary eye: THE MEGA-POMPOUS OVER-INSIGHTFULLY WANNABE-EBERT APPROACH, WITH A NOSTALGIC AND TEARY EYE: To assert my cinematic knowledge; I would say that \"Wayne's World\" is probably to the 90's what \"Car Wash\" was to the 70's, the comedic encapsulation of a spirit that today prevails \u0085 not, with Rock'n'Roll and Heavy Metal replacing Funk and Disco as the two musical pillars conveying the nostalgic feeling of the early 90's. \"Wayne's World\" is so dedicated to music, to the very spirit that made music indispensable in those excessive post-Berlin wall consumerist days, that not only it rocked on that level, but rolled, too. But more than a film about music, \"Wayne's World\" is the ode for a whole generation that grew up with 'Scooby Doo' and 'Sesame Street' and was still sucking the thumbs of the eighties at the dawn of the electronic era. Those were the times were the net was still synonym of fishing, and when Zuckerberg was still watching \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\". In a nutshell, \"Wayne's World\" is to Cinema what \"Smell Like Teen Spirit\" was to Rock. But I guess if Mike Myers was told that his film was the best that ever captured the spirit of the X-generation, he would modestly answer with a suave and solemn voice: \"I was not aware of that!\". Indeed, twenty years later, many viewers look at the film with a nostalgic eye and say 'hey, this is how it used to be' but that's only one (and probably unintentional) secondary level, in fact, when you watch \"Wayne's World\", it's a whole other dimension that cuts straight to you. THE EMOTIONAL INTROSPECTION INTO WAYNE AND GARTH'S INSPIRINGLY SELF-REFLEXIVE INTERACTION: Watching \"Wayne's World\" is an excellent antidote against bad mood, you're simply having a great time following the crazy adventures of Wayne Campbell, the host of a (feeble according to Benjamin) TV public-access cable show of the same name, with his sidekick and best friend Garth Algar. Mike Meyers (in his film debut) and Dana Carvey play one of the most recognizable duos of the 90's and probably the funnier and gentler, as nothing is more exhilarating than watching them making fun of their host, playing road-hockey, lying on the Mirthmobile waiting for planes to land, elaborating the most philosophical statements about girls, music and life, and last but not least, visiting Milwaukee. The film sets the tone very quickly when Wayne starts talking to the camera, the fourth-wall-breaking is one of the film's greatest delights as if it was aware of its own cleverness enough to push the self-derision button, making fun of its own ending, plot devices, and getting away with one of the most blatant cases of product placements... that actually worked and became an instant classic. The talking-to-the-camera is also a perfect invitation to join this group and its communicative fun \u0085 ON THE QUOTABILITY 1-10 SCALE, THIS GOES TO ELEVEN \u0085 It's irreverent but never vulgar, intelligent but not inaccessible, childish but not annoying, the humor displayed in \"Wayne's World\" shares the same goofiness than some Zucker or Brooks' parodies, but it defines something new, beyond the jokes and the inventive vocabulary\u0085 how 'shall' I put it? Well, many lines can lead to cringe-worthy silences or awkward 'What the hell does that mean?' pauses but in \"Wayne's World\", for some reason, the weirdest lines work. Garth might sound a bit too one-dimensional but the way he delivers his \"Hi!\" and \"Thank you\" is a no-cringe guarantee, and don't even get me started on Mike Myers who can make people laugh with lines as stupid as \"Esquueze me? A baking powder?\" just as Jim Carrey can afford to play an obnoxious character like 'Ace Ventura' and keep it funny. When you got talent, you can get away with everything. The film features one classic or priceless line every 30 seconds and\u0085 in fact, let me rewrite this chapter's title, it's : ON THE QUOTABILITY 1-10 SCALE, THIS GOES TO ELEVEN, ON THE MEMORABILITY, TO TWELVE ! The great Howard Hawks said it himself: \"a good movie is three good scenes and zero bad scene\", then Wayne's World is a triumph on the field of comedic film-making. Penelope Spheeris directed one of the funniest American comedies, opening it with the emblematic 'Bohemian Rhapsody' lip-synching scene. And till now, whenever the instrumental part starts, I feel like frenetically banging my head. The film also includes a great cast, Rob Lowe as the antagonistic slick small TV exec and womanizer, and Tia \"Schwing!\" Cassandra, a beautiful Chinese singer. Good thing they avoided the obvious stereotype of a pretty blonde chick, and made her more exotic if only for the Cantonese quotes' gags, that lead to one of the most obscure and hilarious line when they order Cantonese food. The film features many great cameos, among them, a notable performance from Alice Cooper, Alice Cooper who'll help me to conclude this expose by paraphrasing one of the film's most brilliant exchanges : \"In fact, is it \"Wayne's World\" one of the all-time funniest movies?\" \"Yes, Pete it is\" (PS1: the film made it in Gene Siskel's Top 10 movies from 1992, so believe me, it IS worthy! it IS worthy!) (PS2: this review contains 10 superlatives and too many adverbs, it is so incredibly badly written) (PS3: have you noticed that the review's title is a haiku?)"
