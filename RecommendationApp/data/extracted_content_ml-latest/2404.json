      "synopsis": "The film opens with Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) returning to Thailand to once again enlist the help of Vietnam veteran John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) whom has settled in the country since the events of First Blood Part 2. After witnessing Rambo's victory in a stick fighting match in Bangkok, Trautman visits the construction site of the Buddhist temple Rambo is helping to build and asks Rambo to join him on a mission to Afghanistan. The mission is meant to supply weapons, including FIM-92 Stinger missiles, to Afghan rebels, the Mujahideen, who are fighting the Soviets in the Soviet-Afghan War. Despite showing him photos of civilians suffering under Soviet military intervention, Rambo refuses and Trautman chooses to go on his own. While in Afghanistan, Trautman's troops are ambushed by Soviet troops while passing through the mountains at night. Trautman is imprisoned in a Soviet base and coerced for information by Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) and his henchman Kourov (Randy Raney). Rambo learns of the incident from embassy field officer Robert Griggs (Kurtwood Smith) and convinces Griggs to take him through an unofficial operation, despite Griggs' warning that the U.S. government will deny any knowledge of his actions if killed or caught. Rambo immediately flies to Peshawar, Pakistan where he meets up with Mousa Ghanin (Sasson Gabai), a weapons supplier who agrees to take him to Khost, a village deep in the Afghan desert, after Rambo threatens him, close to the Soviet base where Trautman is kept enslaved. The Mujahideen in the village, led by the village's main leader Masoud (Spiros Focas), are already hesitant to help Rambo in the first place. When their village is attacked by Soviet helicopters after one of Mousa's shop assistants has informed the Soviets of Rambo's presence, they agree to help him. Rambo shows his fighting skills when he mans a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun and uses it to shoot down one Soviet helicopter. However, the village is mostly devastated. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid (Doudi Shoua), Rambo makes his way to the Soviet base and starts his plan to free Trautman. The first attempt is unsuccessful and results not only in Hamid getting shot in the leg, but also in Rambo himself getting wood fragments in the side. After escaping from the base, Rambo tends to Hamid's wounds and sends him and Mousa away to safety, before cauterising his own wound with gunpowder and an open flame. The next day, Rambo returns to the base, after scaling a cliff on the fort's perimeter to avoid detection, just in time to rescue Trautman from being tortured with a flamethrower. After rescuing several other prisoners, Rambo steals a Mil Mi-24 helicopter and escapes from the base. However, the helicopter is damaged as it departs and soon crashes, forcing Rambo and Trautman to continue on foot. After a confrontation in a cave, where Rambo and Trautman eliminate several Soviet Spetsnaz commandos, including Kourov, they are confronted by an entire army of Soviet tanks, headed by Zaysen. Zaysen warns them to drop their weapons and comply to his orders saying that they cannot escape and he wants to take them back alive. To which Trautman says to Rambo \"what do you say, John?\" and Rambo replies, loading his gun, \"Fuck 'em\". Just as they are about to be overwhelmed by the might of the Soviet Army, the Mujahideen warriors, together with Mousa and Hamid, ride onto the battlefield by the hundreds in a cavalry charge, overwhelming the Soviets. In the ensuing battle, in which both Trautman and John are wounded, Rambo somehow manages to kill Zaysen by driving a tank into the Soviet colonel's helicopter, which he first tried to damage with a Molotov cocktail, handed to him by a man on a horse. Somehow, Rambo survives the explosion and gets out of the tank. At the end of the battle Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to their Mujahideen friends and leave Afghanistan to go home. The movie ends with two quotes: \"This film is dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan.\" and \"I am like a bullet, filled with lead and made to kill\" However, this was a not the original quote in the movie. Prior to the American war in Afghanistan, the ending quote of the movie read \"This film is dedicated to the brave Mujahideen fighters of Afghanistan\". This was then edited to read \"people of Afghanistan\" during the post 9/11 era.",

         "Believe me RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART 2 took some swallowing but the opening ten minutes of RAMBO 3 caused me to fall out of my chair in shock . John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune ! I mean that`s a bit like having a film where the hero`s an environmentalist who goes around blowing oil rigs to save the Alaskan wilderness . Oh wait a minute didn`t Steven Seagal .... Despite this incredible and vain attempt at character development there follows much dialogue that accurately reflects what is going on in Afghanistan in the mid 1980s . The Soviet - Afghan war actually intensified when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power and by that time over one million Afghans had died in the conflict while as many as five million had been forced over the border into Iran and Pakistan as what analysts at the time called \" Migratory genocide \" , a euphemism that people nowadays would describe as \" Ethnic cleansing \" . There`s other parts of the film that points out that screenwriter Sheldon Lettich has done his homework on the conflict with factual things like Soviet conscripts defecting to the Mujahedeen , of the red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and of the Soviets use of chemical weapons which almost certainly proves that the sloppy script of FIRST BLOOD PART 2 was mainly down to James Cameron than Stallone , but as you`d expect in this type of action adventure movie the script rapidly degenerates into a series of set pieces of an all American superman blowing up a bunch of nasty commies who can`t shoot straight . Ah well at least the main commie isn`t played by a British actor unlike in the last film . Oh and congratulations to Peter McDonald for at least trying to make a Puma helicopter look like a Soviet helicopter gunship . The previous director was under the impression that the Soviets and Viet Cong use American Hueys Setting the record straight : A lot of people prove how ignorant they are of the Soviet - Afghan war by confusing the Mujahedeen with the Taliban . The Mujahedeen ( Translated \" The soldiers of God \" ) and the Taliban ( Translated \" The students of God \" ) are entirely seperate things . The Taliban were created in Pakistan in the early 1990s , took over Afghanistan in 1995 and were led by Mullah Omar . The Mujahedeen were split into several different groups and were led by different leaders ( None of them called Bin Laden ) most of them forming a coalition against the Taliban called the Northern Alliance in 1995/96 . Their overall leader was the legendary guerilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud who was murdered in a suicide bombing by Al Qai`da terrorists in September 2001 . It was the Northern Alliance who fought side by side with the Western coalition during their campaign to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 to the present day",
         "I don't really understand what the disappointment is all about? This movie falls under the genre of action and thats what it delivers from top to bottom. Were people perhaps expecting a drama? And people can also tell me how often do you get to see the Russians and spetsnaz special forces in realistic action? Sure they were vilified, mowed down easily by Rambo, mostly missed him but as the evil villains, they were highly effective in that role. Don't get me wrong, I've nothing but admiration for the Russian military. The main villain (Russian commander) was also a freaking brilliant actor. The movie did'nt use real Russian helicopter gunships, (they used French ones modified instead) but they were still effective. All in all, this is an utterly brilliant and unique film and I give it 10 stars. Best in the Rambo series.",
         "Above average Holywood type action movie that is very under rated because it is very mis-understood.This movie is not to be taken too seriously.If one understands comic book action,that person will dig this movie.The hardware and action sequences here are very top notch.The subject matter is also a good illustration of the Afghan situation at that time.The approach of the movie was on the unrealistic side due to a marketing mainstream \"quick cash\" decition by the producers of this movie.But compared to other movies of the same genre and category (Holywood Formula Military Action Drama),this one is on a higher level in quality.This one is the worst of all the Rambo movies but still,if you ,like the above mentioned genre,you will enjoy this one........",
         "After 'First Blood', I assumed Stallone would have won an Oscar for his portrayal of troubled Vietnam veteran John 'Break Out The Knives' Rambo, and I supposed the fact he didn't was probably down to an oversight on behalf of the Academy or something. When he again failed to pick up the 'Best Actor' statuette after 'Rambo -First Blood, Part II', my suspicions began to rise ... but still I dismissed it as an unfortunate mistake. So imagine my fury when, after Rambo had not only saved imprisoned Vietnam veterans from years of incarceration at the bloodthirsty hands of the Vietcong, but also liberated the proud Afghans from the yoke of Communist oppression, he STILL did not receive the award that was rightfully his? Is this how America treats its war heroes? Because if it is, it's a bloody outrage. Not only did John Stallone liberate an entire country from the iron grip of the Great Bear, but he also found time to win the title of Heavyweight Champion of the World - not once, but THREE bloody times. If I was Sylvester Balboa, I would blow up planet Earth as punishment for being so damned ungrateful.",
         "With the highest budget of the three movies, the movie certainly looks expensive, with an epic scope at times. But you never quite get the feeling that the movie settles into a comfortable groove. Though the action sequences have plenty of gunshots and explosions, the way they are filmed - and edited - doesn't have the right impact or flow, like the action sequences in the second installment. In another comparison to the second installment, the story - while as sparse as this one - certainly kept moving. Here there are a number of segments that move very slowly and/or don't seem to have much purpose. The movie should have gotten down to business. The uneven flow of the movie also suffers near the end, as if the movie all of a sudden decides it needs to wrap things up in a few minutes, making the final battle almost come out of nowhere. (In fairness to the director, it should be pointed out that he was a sudden replacement after original director Russell Mulcahy was fired, and had only ONE DAY to prepare to helm the rest of the movie.) Like the previous installment, there is some dumb dialogue, but this time around it's not delivered in a slight tongue-in-cheek manner. If they had been willing to show this time around that they weren't taking things so seriously, it would have helped. You might say that the actor playing the Russian commander is not playing things seriously, but he goes SO over the top that he's embarrassing. It's watchable, but disappointing - they had the chance to make a kick-ass action movie here. By the way, the Afghans that Rambo helps in this movie are *NOT* the Taliban. People seem to forget that Afghanistan is made up of a number of different tribes. You can tell these particular Afghans are not the Taliban, because (among other things), the women are not completely covered, and the men play the traditional Afghan game with horses and a goat's skin (forbidden by the Taliban.)",
         "This is the Best Action movie of all times; nothing can go beyond that; nothing can come after that! Rambo 3 (Spoilers******) Directed by Peter MacDonald marks the biggest chapter of John J Rambo, the character created by novelist David Morrell. From the acclaimed 1982 original movie 'First Blood' followed with the 1985 sequel 'Rambo II', this current final part really cuts the true face of Rambo. In the path of Salvation it has been a long time Vietnam vet Rambo living a peaceful life in Thailand. But his mentor-best friend Col. Samuel Trautman needs his help for a mission in Afghanistan. John rejects the request making Col. to leave Afghanistan for the military operation. Things went wrong when Russian soldiers capture Colonel. Now Rambo must go to Afghanistan, but the problem is will the One Man Army can win the WAR? Scripted by Sheldon Lettich and Sylvester Stallone himself, tells the most dominant part of Rambo franchise. The story, the screenplay, was really well written and the way it was treated into the cinematic means was just Extreme. All the credit goes to the principal photographic team under John Stanier and the well talented second unit directors Douglas Dean, Jeff Jensen and Nikolas Korda. Together they created such a wide canvas that was over the Top in every means. Plus the soul of Rambo formed by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith makes this movie the most memorable one. His theme and action cues really immerse us in the movie. This is one of his best works, I like the opening club fighting sequence, huh really the score raises my adrenaline; and STALLONE HAS MORE DEFINITION THAN THE FAT PIG ARNOLD. A great action movie with the exotic backdrop of Afghanistan with a cutting edge storyline. Stallone really lived in that character, especially in those smashing action scenes and in emotional parts. I wish to have such body like him one Day. This is extreme! This is the last type of movie with high-quality action spectrums that disappeared with the 1990's. A must see movie for ALL ACTION FILM FANS. \"I gave this movie 10 thumbs up out of 10 stars !\"",
         "For myself, Rambo - First blood part 3 is one of the best action movies ever. In fact the story is a little bit poor, once again the typical one vs an army-story we know already from Rambo 2. Everyone, who does not think about a stupid story and the \"Evil-Russians-topic\" gets an explosive and very bloody action movie without long periods of boredom. In his original uncut version the movie is banned in Germany and this has good reasons. The film is absolutely nothing for kids. In my opinion the Littleton-massacre a few weeks ago was a direct consequence of films like Rambo. If you're old enough, watch it ! The final fight starts with the following dialog: \"John,what're you thinking ?\" Rambo:\" F**k'em!\"",
         "I think this film was judged too much on subject matter and not as an excellently shot action film. Each action sequence is done with immense skill and quality. Sure the script is dodgy, USA v USSR so what! Its time to turn your brain off and enjoy!",
         "Rambo is searching for inner peace and some sort of resolution of how and why he had to fight battles he was made to believe in. Where is the support for veterans by the Government and public alike? Thailand seems the most appropriate place, having rescued the POW's in the previous outing. Had Co Bao lived, things may have been different and Rambo may have finally settled down and been cured of his inner demons. Rambo keeps busy by helping and working for the Monks in the Monastery where he is living. The opening sequence where Rambo is fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok subverts the genre by playing on movie-goers misconceptions of the flawed character. Having defeated his opponent and showed mercy, despite the crowd baying for blood, Rambo pockets the prize money and limps off... he then gives it to the monks. All is not what it seems. Rambo does not go looking for trouble, but it seems to follow him. Unwittingly, he is drawn into the war in Afghanistan. In what is hardly a fair fight, the might of the Russian army is fighting peasants defending their land and homes. Intellectual snobbery and bad press prevented this film from being the classic action drama it rightly deserved, highlighting the plight of the Afghanistan people. Ironically, two days before the film's release, Russia pulled out of Afghanistan. Rambo III was the most expensive film ever made - $60,000,000. Mr. Stallone's combined salary for Rambo III & Rocky V = ¬£25,000,000. The closest competitor was Arnold Schwarzeneger with $10,000,000. With so many stars now in the $20,000,000 price bracket it is easy to forget the Stallone phenomenon.",
         "Rambo III is a action film as simple as that. a hero that does nearly impossible things and thats the attraction of a action hero he's not a real person it's a movie. movies like this just want to entertain you for 90mins. to 2hrs. and no matter how impossible or unrealistic things are you take it for what it is. that's the idea of wild action films they take you to another place, as a film lover i try not to have such high hopes for things, i want to see it with just a open mind . some things you will like and some you don't. rambo III is one i like. people talk about plot and what this film does and does not do . this film gives you just what you think it will."
