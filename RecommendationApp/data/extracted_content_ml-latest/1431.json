         "It's hard for me to review this movie without prejudice because to me, Chris Farley is the funniest person I have ever seen. Even though my adoration of the late comedian precludes me from giving a impartial rating of this movie, I can at least admit that this isn't one of his best efforts (I still loved this movie, it's just not my favourite Farley flick). Nevertheless, I'm going to take the easy way out and say: Come on, take it for what it is, a Chris Farley movie. Farley plays Haru, an orphan adopted at birth by a clan of ninjas. He is raised under the pretenses that he is the Great White Ninja. Needless to say, his development is much anticipated by his teachers . Unfortunately, to the dismay of everyone, he grows up to be overweight and klutzy. While the ninja graduates are out celebrating, Haru finds himself alone at the retreat when a mysterious woman (Nicollette Sheridan) enters looking for help. Believing Haru to be a ninja, she hires him to spy on her boyfriend, an assignment he accepts with great enthusiasm. Hot on the boyfriend's trail, Haru witnesses a murder and eventually ends up in Beverly Hills. Surviving on dumb luck and a designated guardian ninja, Haru never gives up on his task. Like I said before, this isn't Farley's greatest contribution to his comedic resume. But make no mistake, this is a funny movie. Farley's bread and butter is his propensity to bumble and stumble in any given situation - walking into poles, falling down stairs, crushing coffee tables, etc. Since his character is expected to be agile and sleek, the comedy in \"Beverly Hills Ninja\" is that much funnier. The exact same formula worked for Farley's SNL character Barney, the Chippendale's hopeful. Many critics felt that, by this time, Farley was a one-trick-pony whose act had nothing more to offer than jokes involving head and groin injuries. Perhaps his choice in films were poor but to don't deny him the recognition of his talent is unfair. Watch the movie and you'll see Farley display all the qualities of a great comedian: intelligence, timing, pathos. He was a tremendous talent and I will miss him very much.",
         "Relax! Laugh your butt off!!! It's Chris Farley!!!!! Reading through other comments posted here, I notice that people are using five or six big paragraphs to review this. There's really not enough about this movie to be spending so much time reviewing it. Don't see this movie hoping for a great story or accurate ninja fighting action, or compelling drama like some of the commentors here seem dissapointed with. Take the stick out yer bum and relax. Just enjoy Chris Farley at his best. Few movies have ever made me laugh harder. I'm not an aged 8-14 male.",
         "I myself happen to be a fifth degree black belt (godan) and on many occasions have felt as goofy and clumsy as Farley's character in this funny gem. I truly love this movie, except it really saddens me to think Farley is not with us anymore. This guy was great. Rest in Peace big fellow. Thanks for this great, silly, funny movie.",
         "This is my son's favorite movie. Of course he is 10. My husband and I watch it and find it entertaining as well. It is silly and the physical comedy can be over the top, but that is classic Farley. We also like Tommy Boy, another Farley classic, and Dirty Works also with Farley, all though that flick is definitely not appropriate for children. Beverly Hills Ninja, however is appropriate for most children 10 and over. Pretty mild by today's standards. One of my favorite performances in this movie is the work of supporting actor Robin Shou. He is a great straight man and shows great martial arts skills as well as comedic timing. Chris Rock also has a small roll in this film.",
         "Please forgive the length of this first paragraph, but it is needed to explain my opinion of this film. I never saw this film in the theater; it looked a little silly to me. One day a few months later it came on pay-per-view. Due to a technical glitch the cable company unscrambled the pay-per-view channels all day long. It also happened to be raining and generally miserable out, so my buddies and I decided to watch this movie. We had three pay-per-view channels, and one of the channels showed a single movie all day long. Guess which movie it was. The first time we watched it, we thought it was goofy, even stupid, and didn't really care for it. However like many teens, we mindlessly watched it again . . . and again . . . and again. We watched this film all day. \"Why?\" you ask; because it truly gets better every time you watch it. I think the reason is because this is a stupid film, and when you first watch it, you're too smart for it. Eventually though the IQ points seep out of your head, and you're able to fully enjoy this great movie. The bottom line: Watch this film at least 5 times, not necessarily back-to-back but it helps. It will grow on you. Even if you don't like Farley, watch this film for Chris Rock. Rock's performance is perfect, despite being too small of a role. Farley's performance is perfect as the bumbling but good-hearted \"Great White Ninja.\" Even the chicken's performance is perfect. If you find the concept of a fat, white ninja involved in an Asian gang war mildly provocative, check your brain at the door and enjoy.",
         "Beverly Hills Ninja may not reach the same level as Tommy Boy, but what Chris Farley movie could possibly top that comic masterpiece. Beverly Hills Ninja is nevertheless a valiant attempt. It is filled with classic moments which will not be soon forgotten. Examples include Haru protecting Sensai's ninja \"house\" when he first meets Alison and nearly destroys singlehandedly the entire place and the superb dialogue (such as, \"You do not have Ninja intuition. In fact, you do not even have normal intuition.\") Who can forget such classic movie moments? But, probably the most enjoyable aspect of Chris Farley's movies is watching the response of others watching Chris Farley in action. Chris is one person you really love or you really hate. One of these extremes always prevails. And, for those of us who truly enjoy his work, nothing brings more joy than seeing the look of disgust and outrage on another person's face as they watch Chris Farley. Watching people toss and turn in their seats just hoping to get out of the theater as soon as possible really brings happiness to Chris Farley fans everywhere. It only highlights the high quality of his work (and the lack of a sense of humor on others' part). Although we can always enjoy his movies in video, nothing will compare to the full theater experience. Beverly Hills Ninja takes this aspect of his work to a new level. A great movie and one definitely to watch (multiple times).",
         "The kind of film which throws jokes at you by the second in the hope that some will stick, this film is funny make no mistake. Chris Farley had his 'bumbling fat bloke' routine down to a tee after excursions in Tommy Boy, Black Sheep and Airheads and this is same type of daft humour. Not brilliant by any means but is worth watching for a giggle if you can find the time.",
         "Farley could be funny when he tried to be. His stupid fat guy act sometimes was hard to swallow, but usually was great! This has to be Farleys best film to date, where he plays a 'ninja' out to save a pretty girl from her bad husband! Farley is hilarious in this movie, it never lets up, and it is sad farley passed away - all that great talent gone for good. This film should have had sequals, a real shame....",
         "It is undeniable in saying that Chris Farley has a presence on the big screen. He offers another gem of a performance in this one. He was found on a stormy night be Sensei and was named \"Haru\", the prophisized \"Great White Ninja\". The beginning of the film shows him training to be a ninja, with such funny stunts as him trying to lift a burning cauldron with his open forearms, spilling it all over the others. On the day of truth, he is not selected to graduate and become a ninja. The plot of the story is simply this - He is proposed by Allison Page to help her in a steal mission against a \"counterfeiter\". Not all goes to plan when he witnesses a killing. He uses the matchbook that Allison gave him to determine that he must go to Beverly Hills in her aid. Little things like Farley leaving his shoes at the door of the hotel everytime he enters (and the janitor sweeping them up everytime) shows his native roots. The director was great at adding such small but noticeable tendencies to make it more realistic. Farley walks around looking for Allison dressed as a pimp - he is supposed to blend in with the locals - but that is not a good way to do it. All the while Gobbei, the best ninja declared by Sensei can be seen on the otherhand with his face painted to look like he is part of a statue. Throughout the movie he helps Haru and is his \"shadow\" to make sure he succeeds in his mission without Haru knowing he is being helped. Now forget the plot, it isn't going to win any awards. The meat of the film - what you really are there to see is Chris Farley pull off his hijinx. Funny scenes such as when he is in a Beverly Hills strip joint and he is up on stage and sees a hot stripper, he shakes his fists and says repeatedly \"I am one with the universe, I am one with the universe\" as a ninja SHOULD be, but he cannot resist her and starts dancing along side her, comically rubbing his nipples and then revealing his tight white undershirt which he attempts to rip. The crowd of men, all the while are cheering for him and he falls off the stage flat on his back breaking a table and is thrown out by the bouncers. Then when two men are shot out the buildings window by Tanley's goons and land by the garbage where \"Haru\" has been pushed, an Asian ladies repeatedly screams out the window which is classic and made me laugh. Another great scene is when Farley staying on his quest to help foil Tanley's plan, goes in disguise into a Japanese restaurant as a sushi cook person. This is the funniest point in the film and involves Farley flipping a shrimp down a woman's dress and he pulls it from her breasts, sniffing it and making some sort of funny comment. The final funny scenes is his pretending to be the money printing guy - I won't go into much but this was the best part of the movie and near the end too. I like the soundtrack, from \"I'm too sexy\" to \"Kung Fu Fighting\", it was great. We see little of Chris Rock in this movie, a hotel employee who wants to learn how to become a ninja like Haru, and chases chickens to learn. It was Farley's spotlight and so deserved. Farley R.I.P.",
         "This film is great for fans of Chris Farley. Since I am a fan I liked it more than most people would. But if I really look at this movie as a normal moviegoer and not biased I'd say it's a silly, messy, clumsy piece of work. The story is just there to show off Chris Farley's goofiness which it does quite well. None of it believable for a second but I don't think it is supposed to be. The music used throughout fits it good enough. The acting is average at best. Of all Farley movies this is one of the best. Overall I would definitely recommend this film to fan's of Farley's antics. See it for that reason only."
