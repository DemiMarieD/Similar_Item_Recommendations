         "When I was growing up in the 80's, there were basically three camps of movies that were so incredibly funny that they were legendary among my peers and my generation. Those movies were the Monty Python films (Holy Grail, Life of Brian, Meaning of Life), the Mel Brooks classics (Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein), and the Airplane! movies. Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy is an awesome example of how funny a movie can be, and I hope that some day more people will see it that way and that it will achieve a cult status as a legend of great comedy. It did terribly at the box office, but that was just some unfortunate oversight. Brain Candy features uncanny wit, rollicking absurdity, hilarious zaniness, immaculately understated social commentary, and some of the best comic performances ever filmed (my personal favorite performances are Mark as Don Roritor and Scott Thompson as the clueless closeted gay guy). I believe that the particular kind of comedy in Brain Candy is not easy to enjoy during the first viewing, which is why you should watch it a few times. When the Kids' masterpiece starts sinking in to your head, you'll start getting a whole lot of laugh-returns on your investment.",
         "This film meant more to me than just 'a feature film featuring the comedy troop, The Kids in the Hall'. I am a Kids In The Hall fan. Their first feature length film theme was a good one. They took on one of the biggest things of 1996 and poked fun and holes at it: \"Depression\". You have to remember, by 1996, depression drugs were being dispensed at an all time high. People were \"sad\" and wanted to be happy all the time so prescriptions were running wild for these depression drugs-- Prozac being the top one. So the Kids went after this theme. Remember, this is The Kids in the Hall taking on this, not the book \"Prozac Nation\". This film may seem silly to some, or even awful for those who expected the same kind of Kids work as they had done in their series, but I did like it and I like the way they went about taking on a popular subject at the time most people didn't wish to admit how popular it really was. Look back at \"Brain Candy\", well, may seem a tad bit dated now that in 2003 we should \"know better\". Do we? But again, I gotta hand it to the Kids in the Hall for being \"sharp\" enough to tackle this..and the WAY they tackled this. Think about it...is your health less important than corporate profits? (\"We beat -- penicillin!!!!\")And how about the summary at the end of the film by the taxi driver...\"it's Okay to be sad...sometimes.\" The Kids in the Hall were a very talented Comedy troupe of gentlemen and to some degree many expected something more comedic from them with their familiar characters and material for their first film fare, but again, I thought this was a more creative way to go, a more daring and brilliant way to go. Sometimes it strayed, but it all came back to the central theme. This is NOT for everyone's taste, but for those who want to venture into something different from a comedy troupe..maybe along the lines of the Monty Python's troupe fare of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" -- who's theme too was way out there for a comedy troupe. It's enjoyable, pick this one up, see it for what it is.",
         "If you're coming to this site trying to decide whether to rent BRAIN CANDY or not, let me put your mind at rest and tell you to run to the video store right now and get the DVD. At least all these mediocre reviews here don't set you up for disappointment, as can be demonstrated by my shock at its hilarity when I first saw it. That was actually a wonderful surprise. It's of course overlooked, but isn't that always a little bit nice with a gem? Kevin McDonald garnered an awesome soundtrack (Pixies, Odds, Cibo Matto, Pavement, etc), they all turn in great SUBTLE (!) performances, the writing is never low brow or cliched (THANK YOU!!), and last but not least its the Kids for God's sake, and everything they touch always turns gold. There are so many quotable lines in this movie that it's insane, and PLUS it stays with you for a long time. When I first saw it, I wasn't even that familiar with the Kids and still enjoyed it a lot. It actually got me more interested in them. It has pitch black humor, is intelligent, and has a message (It even left me feeling guilty on my opinion on antidepressants)! And not only are fans treated with new, well thought out characters but with recurring favorites. Basically, it has everything you could ask for in a movie.",
         "Okay. Where to begin? It's phenomenal. If you've ever watched a single Kids in the Hall episode and caught yourself stifling a guffaw for you feared laughing at an orgasming, androgynous chicken-lady(?) might classify you as a lunatic, go see Brain Candy. If you haven't experienced that, go see it anyways. I personally think it's the some of the best modern comedic writing there is out there. The troupe collated their ability to create off-the-wall scenes with a Monty-Python-esque flair of weaving the same actors into decidedly varying roles, and thus spawned a seriously non-serious satire of man's eternal search for happiness. I saw this movie first in the theater, and the odd things is, I didn't laugh once during the entire showing. The true hilarity of the flic hit me several hours later as a friend and I mused its elusive intricacies in a coffee shop. We were nearly falling out of our chairs with just the simple mentioning of many of the scenes. I made a point of seeing it again, and have never regretted adding it to my 'all time favourite' list. Go see it. Booyah.",
         "The TV show was funny as hell, although it was sometimes hit-and-miss ; but what sketch show isn't. This movie contains a well planned plot executed by a diverse but motley crew of characters. It makes you think that the BBC show League of Gentlemen isn't as original as you thought it was! Also, the impersonation of Lorne Michaels is spot-on, and makes you think the Dr Evil character from Austin Powers isn't as original as you thought either (as they are both spoofing Mr Michaels - who produced both SNL for Myers and Kids in the Hall). Great fun... and try not to laugh out loud at the 'cancer boy' character.",
         "A group of researchers for a pharmaceutical company release Gleemonex, a drug that brings people's happiest memory to the surface and cures depression. All is right in the world, at least until the drug is discovered to have some side effects down the road. The Kids in the Hall had a great show, and it's no surprise they were able to make a great movie. With a very limited cast, they play dozens of parts and keep the humor rolling from the very beginning. If there's a group that is the spiritual successor to Monty Python, it is probably KITH. Some of the best jokes are just throw-aways: a cop that dreams about sex with toast, a therapist who doesn't speak German, and a scientist who develops a drug that gives ex-girlfriends worms. One of the running jokes throughout the film is a man who is obviously gay but is unable to admit it. He is consistently funny, even after he comes out in the middle of a musical scene. Some people allegedly thought that including Cancer Boy was insensitive and not funny in the slightest. I disagree. If it's okay to make fun of depression and homosexuals, I think cancer should be perfectly acceptable. I may not be easily offended, but I think this was fine. A couple other things made this film great: a great soundtrack with bands like They Might Be Giants and The Odds. One of the earliest film appearances of Selma Blair. Seriously, the only way you would not find this funny is if you had a stick up your butt or you were a flipper baby.",
         "KITH's full feature film!! It's our five favorite clearly insane guys from up north. What else can you ask for? First, the story does NOT have your typical happy bears skipping, nutty bunnies frolicking kind of ending. The concept of pharmaceutical drugs being able to make life a better place is very thought provoking. Think about how we rely on drugs to treat colds, headaches...of course, we can discuss society's views on 'other' drugs, but that's a different monologue onto itself!! Anyhoo, the origin of the drug's name is hilarious!! I have to admit, the Kids really spoof the corporate world well. Bruce and Mark really play their eccentric characters to a \"T\". RED SOCKS, repeat, RED SOCKS!! Although limited, Dave does a great job playing the straight man (\"I don't understand German\"). Kev is his manic awesome self and Scott's best role is probably that of closet case Wally. I haven't even touched upon Grivo, the cabbie or any of the other characters in the film. Don't forget about Bellini! PLUS cameos too! KUDOS to the guys for not caving in and taking out C.B. (for those who haven't seen it, I don't want to spoil it) from the film due to pressure from the P.C. laden bigwig movie execs. I also enjoyed the moral (twisted though it is true) of the movie and there is a lot of subtle humor...just a tad darker than their TV series. The last time i saw this was probably 1996. Watching it again on DVD makes me really appreciate (and miss) the guys' film. Sure, it may not have done great in the box office or achieved the big bucks. Usually, I tend to avoid mainstream blockbuster poo, so Brain Candy is definitely cult material. But then again, aren't Kids in the Hall? *Sadly, the DVD is bare bones with the movie in widescreen format, chapter search and audio/subtitle. It's really great to just have this gem in my collection. Hey, I recently heard that KITH were discussing doing another feature film. Hmmm....",
         "Having only ever seen one episode of 'Kids in the Hall' in my life and having only a vague idea about the group (Canadian Monty Python being the easy comparison), I think it's fair to say that I came the film as somewhat ignorant when it came to all things 'Kids'. I have to say that I was able to enjoy the film for what it was, rather than have any expectations of what it could be. What interested me most of all was it's darkness, something a lot closer to League of Gentlemen territory rather than Monty Python. On an alternate note does anyone else notice a similarity between Don Roritor and Doctor Evil?",
         "The audiences and critics seem split on the solitary feature effort from the Canadian comedy troupe \"Kids In The Hall\". Even Siskel and Ebert had a split love/hate feeling, respectively, about the film. But I was and shall remain a major fan of the television show and welcomed \"Brain Candy\" with open arms. When the show aired it's final episode in 1994, I felt a sense of sadness overcome me. But without a doubt in my mind, I knew these five talented guys would continue to entertain the masses in some other forum. Not too long after the conclusion to the five year run, I was dining in Toronto with my wife and I had the occasion to meet Bruce McCulloch and chat briefly with him, much to my wife's embarrassment. For the record, I feel that I chose an entirely appropriate time to approach him, not interrupting a conversation with his friend or his meal. After receiving an expression of my appreciation of the show, he answered an inquiry about future plans by telling me of a feature film project involving the whole cast. It wasn't until a couple of years later that the film was finally released, and I had been basically anticipating it the whole time. That said, I was not let down whatsoever. I had heard in interviews with various \"Kids\" that their intention wasn't to re-use some of the old characters from the show at all, but as the script evolved, their were a number of instances where they just fit perfectly in to the story line. Also in such interviews, it came out that the troupe wasn't exactly always getting along perfectly which was part of the reasons for the group's disbanding. It seemed from such comments that this was a final farewell, but some of the members stated that they were not adverse to the idea of another one in the future. Aside from the familiar masterful antics from the five comics, there are numerous shots of Toronto locations that show in more ways than one their prominent sense of Canadian pride about the whole production. For more elements of Canadiana, Craig Northey of \"Odds\", a favourite band of the \"Kids\", provided the score for the film, and the whole band collaborated on a couple of songs featured in the film as an important part of the story line. The only thing missing from the film, but not from the great soundtrack, is the familiar theme from the show, \"Having An Average Weekend\" by Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet. The opening bars of the theme always signified simultaneously something great and something sad about TV for me: It meant \"Kids In The Hall\" was either beginning or ending. Another aspect of integrity that the \"Kids In The Hall\" maintained was the refusal to cut certain scenes that would be considered by many to be just on the edge of completely tasteless humour, particularly one character named \"Cancer Boy\". On CBC, they had their restrictions with content and subject matter, but in many ways they enjoyed much more freedom than many other shows ever experienced. But on HBO broadcasts, I presume they had a bit more free reign, especially with the language used. And so all the \"Kids\" have all left home to do their own thing in various arenas of North America. As far as I'm concerned they're a national treasure as much as \"Monty Python\" is to Britain. We'll always have syndication.",
         "When I first saw this movie I had never seen the TV series, so I didn't have any preconceived ideas about what this movie was going to be like. I belong to a group of people who question the pharmaceutical industry and the premise of the movie appealed to me. Every time I see this film I find new funny details. At my house we have shown this movie to our friends and they all seemed to love it. Each actor portrays several characters and they are very distinctive. I also think the message throughout is important and this movie is worth watching! It's too bad some people didn't like this movie. I think since the movie wasn't heavily publicized it didn't reach the potential but it's a cult favorite in my circle of friends. I'm surprised Scientology hasn't promoted this movie because it portrays psych meds in an unfavorable light."
