      "synopsis": "The narrator (Stanley Jones) tells of an event that once threatened the existence of the entire human race. It occurred in \"the most seemingly innocent and unlikely of places\", Skid Row, in New York. Three teenage girls (Michelle Weeks, Tisha Campbell-Martin, and Tichina Arnold) appear throughout the film as a Motown-singing Greek chorus. They set the scene at the unassuming Mushnick's Flower Shop (\"Little Shop of Horrors\"). Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis), the meek, clumsy employee of Mr. Mushnick (Vincent Gardenia), lives a dreary life among the other unfortunate residents of Skid Row (\"Skid Row/Downtown\"). Taken in by Mushnick as a young orphan, Seymour lives in a tiny room below the flower shop and is treated fairly poorly by his employer. The light of his life is his co-worker, Audrey (Ellen Greene), a fragile, battered woman stuck in an abusive relationship. The flower shop is making virtually no money, and Mr. Mushnick is on the verge of closing it for good when Audrey mentions the strange and interesting new plant Seymour has been developing, and suggests that if it is properly advertised, it might attract more business. Seymour presents the plant, a large bud surrounded by layers of leaves. Mushnick is pleasantly surprised when customers begin flocking in after seeing the little plant in the window. Seymour has no idea what kind of plant it is, but explains how he got it (\"Da Doo\"): While he was shopping for odd new plants, his hobby, a solar eclipse occurred. After daylight returned, the strange plant seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Seymour bought it for cheap and brought it home to examine. He shyly admits that he named it \"Audrey II.\" The shop is doing record business until the plant begins to wither. Seymour frantically tries to nurse it back to health, though water, sunlight, fertilizer, and minerals have done no good (\"Grow For Me\"). When he pricks his finger on a rose thorn and draws blood, Audrey II responds vigorously. Seymour realizes what it lives on, and reluctantly gives it a few drops. Audrey II has a dramatic growth spurt and business picks up, with Seymour becoming a local celebrity (\"Some Fun Now\"). He does not reveal the secret behind the plant's health. Audrey's boyfriend, Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin), is a sadistic dentist with a leather jacket, motorcycle, and ducktail haircut. He adores his profession because of the constant opportunities to inflict pain on others (\"Dentist!\"). He enhances his pleasure through his habit of huffing nitrous oxide, or \"giggle gas\", for a euphoric high. Seymour and Mushnick are concerned, as Audrey often comes to work with injuries or a black eye. Orin arrives at the shop one night to pick up Audrey, and Seymour sees first hand how roughly he treats her. Audrey, meanwhile, secretly dreams of an idyllic suburban life with Seymour (\"Somewhere That's Green\"), but is too frightened to leave Orin. Seymour angrily paces around the empty shop at night, venting his frustrations to Audrey II, who is now roughly the size of an armchair. To Seymour's great surprise, Audrey II responds with a human voice (Levi Stubbs) and demands more food. Knowing that the plant can no longer live on mere droplets of blood (partially because it is too big, and partially because Seymour is now weak and anemic from feeding the plant from his bleeding fingers), Seymour is reluctant to provide it with bigger portions. The smooth-talking Audrey II promises Seymour money, fame, and the girl of his dreams if he continues to nourish it with human blood (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). Seymour initially refuses to murder for the benefit of Audrey II, reasoning that he doesn't know anyone \"who deserves to get chopped up and fed to a hungry plant.\" Audrey II directs him to the window, where he sees Orin assaulting Audrey across the street. Filled with rage, Seymour agrees to bring back a specific meal for the plant. The next day, Seymour goes to Orin's office with a gun in his coat pocket. The patient before him, Arthur Denton (Bill Murray) is a gleeful masochist who frustrates Orin by actually enjoying the oral torture he receives. After Denton's departure, Orin drags Seymour into his office to get the sadistic fix he had been craving. Though he wants to spare Audrey further pain and has promised Audrey II fresh blood, Seymour is terrified of shooting Orin. Conveniently, Orin dons his special gas mask, which provides him with constant nitrous oxide and increases his sadistic pleasure. The mask malfunctions and Seymour watches his nemesis asphyxiate before his eyes. Seymour drags the body back to the flower shop, where he reluctantly chops it up with an axe and feeds it piece by piece to Audrey II. Seymour is understandably shaken by the incident, and sees the police speaking with Audrey the next morning about Orin's disappearance. He tries to comfort Audrey, telling her that she had deserved a better man all along. While Audrey admits that her low self-esteem kept her tied to Orin, she feels partially responsible for his fate because she had been silently wishing him out of her life. Though he does not reveal the truth about what became of Orin, Seymour promises to stand by Audrey no matter what (\"Suddenly Seymour\"). Invigorated from finally winning Audrey's love, Seymour returns to the flower shop. He is confronted by Mushnick, who had seen Seymour dismembering Orin's body the night before. Mushnick assumes that Seymour's devotion to Audrey caused him to murder the cruel dentist, but does not suspect that Audrey II is involved, and knows nothing of its grisly diet. Mushnick leads Seymour upstairs at gunpoint, planning to turn him in to the police. He then offers Seymour a proposition: Seymour leaves town forever, and Mushnick keeps the money-making plant. As Audrey II coaxes Seymour to sacrifice Mushnick to clear his own name (\"Suppertime\"), Seymour nervously backs Mushnick into the gaping maw of the hungry plant, killing two birds with one stone. With Audrey II grown to enormous proportions, Seymour's celebrity increases (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\"). However, he is miserable and terrified of the plant's eating habits getting out of hand. He begins to fend off the media and turn down large sums of money, feeling guilty for his part in the secret deaths of Audrey II's meals. He finally puts his foot down, denying the plant any further feedings. He and Audrey plan to run away that night and get married, escaping Skid Row forever. However, he buckles when Audrey II seemingly agrees to accept some meat from the butcher instead of a human corpse. Seymour falls for the ruse and leaves the shop. The plant, with its fully mobile tendrils, uses the phone to call Audrey's apartment across the street, begging for water. Audrey, in her wedding dress, comes to oblige, and is amazed that the huge plant can talk. As she fetches the watering can, the plant wraps its vines around her legs and drags her into its mouth (\"Suppertime II\"). Seymour returns just in time to save Audrey from being devoured. Outside the shop, he explains how dangerous the plant is, and how he only kept it because he thought Audrey would cease to like him if he were no longer rich and famous. Audrey assures Seymour that she loved him from the moment she met him, and still does. They are interrupted by a salesman (James Belushi) who shares with Seymour his idea of collecting trimmings from the plant and marketing miniature Audrey IIs all over the country. Seymour deducts that this was the plant's plan all along: It was an alien that came to earth during the solar eclipse and was bent on world domination. He rushes back into the shop for a final showdown with Audrey II. The plant thwarts Seymour's efforts at killing it, and begins to taunt him as its branches destroy the building and new buds begin to bloom (\"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\"). Emerging from the rubble, Seymour grabs a live electric wire and touches it to Audrey II's vine, electrocuting it and causing it to explode into nothing. Seymour and Audrey are married and arrive at their suburban dream home, just as Audrey had imagined. As they enter the front door, a baby Audrey II plant is seen in their garden, a tiny smile on its pod.",

         "The 1986 film version of the Broadway musical LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is an entertaining movie based on the black comedy from the 1960's about a nerdy milquetoast who raises a man-eating plant that gets totally out of control. Rick Moranis is perfection as Seymour, the nebbish who is at a loss at what to do when his own Frankenstein grows too big for him to control and Ellen Greene (reprising her role in the original musical) is delightful as Audrey, the object of Seymour's affections. Moranis and Greene make one of the most engaging screen teams I've seen in a while. Vincent Gardenia plays the greedy flower shop owner, Mr. Mushnik and Bill Murray is hysterically funny in one scene as Arthur Denton, a man who seems to enjoy going to the dentist a little too much. Tischina Arnold, Tisha Campbell, and Michelle Weeks are awesome as the Greek Chorus known as \"The Urchins\" and Steve Martin practically steals the movie as \"Orin Scrivello, DDS\". His song \"Be a Dentist\" is hysterically funny. The voice of the plant, Audrey II, is provided by Levar Stubbs of The Four Tops and he is superb. A fun musical comedy that the whole family can enjoy.",
         "No, not the black & white Roger Corman jewel featuring Jack Nicholson, though I suppose I'd watch that one again too. I'm talking about the 1986 color musical with Rick Moranis and Audrey II by way of Frank Oz. Like I tell my friends about \"Babe,\" I love a film with a Greek chorus. In this one, the chorus consists of three Motownish women singers, Crystal, Chiffon and Ronette. I'll watch this film again, just to hear them sing one line: \"TO \u0096 TAL \u0096 E \u0096 CLIPSE \u0096 OF \u0096 THE \u0096 SUN!\" This is an all-singing, all-dancing science fiction black comedy that features human misery, a sadistic dentist, a masochistic patient, casual murder, girlfriend abuse, and a blood-sucking alien house plant monster. It's hilarious from beginning to end. And the music is outstanding.",
         "One of the most unappreciated films of the eighties, the songs, performances, and especially the affectionate screenplay all harken back to the cheap old days of Roger Corman and his B movie compatriots. From Steve Martin's sadistic Elvis-inspired dentist to the early girl-group rock score, \"Little Shop\" moves with an appropriately cheesy style that lets you in on the joke, yet never insults you for loving those poverty row movies.",
         "It IS a musical! This film has great music and dance tunes throughout! Rick Moranis is spot-on as the nerd who falls for the beautiful woman (who, of course, basically dismisses him). Along the way, he acquires a flesh-eating plant that loves people - the wrong way. The plant (Audrey 2 after Audrey, the love interest) also sings wonderfully and it makes for a great time! This one's a classic for sure!",
         "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (1986) ***1/2 Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, Vincent Gardenia, Steve Martin, Jim Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Guest. Entertaining musical comedy based on the off-Broadway smash inspired by Roger Corman's cult low-budget horror flick \"The Little Shop of Horrors\" never lets up on energy in this decidedly camp tale about nerd Seymour Krelborn (Moranis in geek mode) the apprentice florist at a skid row floral shop whose hybrid creation of a Venus flytrap grows in more ways than one when it develops a nasty craving for human blood. Very funny and brightly directed by Muppeteer Frank Oz with lots of eye candy and expert detail of 1960 with a creme de la creme cast of comic geniuses. Outstanding especially is Martin as the sadomasochistic dentist a la Elvis and his scene with pain on the brain patient Murray (pricelessly hysterical in the role made famous by a young Jack Nicholson). Great creature visuals of \"Audrey II\" with voice provided by Four Tops leadman Levi Stubbs. Greene does a memorable turn as the abused heroine Audrey whose best described as Marilyn Monroe and Carol Channing purreed into one; sad sexpot with a lot of spunk and heart. Memorable songs particularly the show stopper \"Suddenly Seymour\".",
         "Delightful film version of the Off Broadway triumph based on the Roger Corman black comedy, carried off beautifully here by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's memorable tunes.",
         "I have known this film since I could crawl. And it was very cool when I was in it at my high school. Ah, memories. *sniff*, oh sorry! The musical is a lot of fun to watch. It is a little cheesy on some levels. But you'll enjoy it somewhat. Rick Moranis is a wonderful actor. I really enjoyed him as Seymor. The rest of the cast delivers a great musical. Steve Martin is one of the best characters in \"Litle Shop\". And as well as the extremely talented John Candy.*hint* :D I would recommend this for a fun time. But I am still curious about the original ending. 7/10",
         "I am usually not a big fan of musicals turned into film (except in the case of films like \"Fame\" or Busby Berkeley films), but \"Little Shop of Horrors\" surprised me. I rushed right out and bought the soundtrack! The music is excellent, very tongue-in-cheek, great lyrics, music reminiscent of the 50s (the female chorus members are named after girl groups: Crystal, Ronette, Chiffon), and just fun to listen to. The ensemble cast is one of the best in recent history. Everybody in the film acts in a role tailor-made for them! Rick Moranis as a geek, Ellen Greene as a bubbly blonde, Steve Martin as a cool biker dentist, Bill Murray as a giggling masochist, Vincent Gardenia as a slob flower shop owner, etc. Fans of the original Corman film will be deeply disappointed. Gone is all and any dark humor from that film. I deeply miss the scene where Seymour considers getting a hooker to feed to Audrey II (Seymour: \"You're too bony?\" Hooker: \"Bony? [exposes torso] What do you think this is? Chopped liver?\")! But all that is missing is replaced by fun musical numbers, sleazy sets, and a much better Audrey II plant. The musical version ended with Audrey being eaten and Seymour sacrificing himself to the plant, but the movie's ending is made to be happier...sort of... Recommended for everyone, even those who aren't fans of musicals!",
         "Noting the several comments from people who hated or just didn't \"get\" this film, I am more convinced than ever that democracy is a rather lame idea since many people are simply too stupid or vapid to deserve a vote. But I digress.... I laughed my ass off when I first heard that \"Little Shop\" was being remade as a musical, and gleefully predicted that it would be an even bigger turd than the musical remake of \"Lost Horizon\" -- truly one of the most ghastly things that ever soiled a piece of film. I rented the presumed-abominable \"Little Shop\" musical, invited a few friends over, and we flat fell in love with this movie. None of us are even big fans of musicals; I liked \"Carousel\" and \"Oklahoma,\" but that's pretty much my complete list of musicals that will bear re-watching. And now this one! Boy, did I ever call this one wrong, and I'm damned glad I did. I've seen it ten or fifteen times, and caught pieces of it another few dozen times while flipping channels. I never tire of it. It's that good. The music is fabulous (as many others have commented), and every piece of casting is perfect. Rick Moranis, who I never thought of as anything other than a competent character actor, does a grand job; he's actually VERY competent and perfect for this role. Surprisingly, he does an amazingly good job of singing (if it was lip-synched, the voice-match was simply perfect). His stock shot up a lot of points with me for this work. His duet work with Ellen Greene (particularly on the operatic \"Suddenly Seymour\") was superb, though I'll bet he was sorely intimidated to be belting out a duet with someone with the power and range of the incredible Ellen Greene. But he rips right in, carries it off beautifully, and magic happens. There are a lot of tremendous voices in \"Little Shop,\" but \"Suddenly Seymour\" never fails to bring out the goose bumps for me. How that tiny little woman can shake the walls like that is a great mystery -- my God, what a pair of lungs! Everyone else has sung the praises of Levi Stubbs and Steve Martin, and a raft of other cameo roles, so I'll just say, \"Ditto.\" As I said, I was a big fan of the very dark \"original\" version, and I never saw the stage play. I've read enough about the \"original\" ending of this musical (which I won't spoil) to believe that I'd have liked the \"original\" ending at least as much as the basically \"happy\" ending we were left with. I'd love to see a DVD with both versions, just to compare. I was perfectly prepared to hate this film, and particularly since I have nothing but disgust for Geffen, personally. However, this has become one of my favorite films of all time -- certainly on my \"Top 30\" or thereabouts, maybe even \"Top 20.\"",
         "\"Little Shop of Horrors\" really is a movie that is fun to watch over and over again. I'm not a big musical fan but I can appreciate a classic like \"Grease\", \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and a good Disney movie. \"Little Shop of Horrors\" is also on my list of classic musicals. It was a good move by director Frank Oz to make the sets campy and musical like. It gives the movie an excellent feeling and atmosphere. Also the way of acting is very campy and over the top which works excellent for the movie. The movie is filled with some nice cameo's by famous actors. My favorite cameos are by John Candy and Bill Murray both as excellent and fun characters that are good for some serious laughs. The other most fun character is played by Steve Martin in one of his best and most fun roles I've ever seen him in. I can't say that I'm a big fan of all of the songs but still there are some good songs in the movie which makes it a successful and pleasant musical to watch and listen to. 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
