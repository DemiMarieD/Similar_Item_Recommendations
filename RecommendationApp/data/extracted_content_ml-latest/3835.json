         "In her film debut,the attractive Alicia Silverstone plays Darian Forrester,a mentally disturbed 14 year old girl who develops an unhealthy obsession with her neighbour,Nick Eliot (Cary Elwes)a baby faced blonde hair,blue eyed journalist who has no sexual interest in her.Silverstone shines in her role as the villain,making life hell for Nick,who wants nothing more than a friendship with the girl next door.Darian's desperate attempts to seduce the older man are unsuccessful,driving her deeper into her obsession and making her more psychotic.Silverstone's acting is superb,but her facial expressions are what is so convincing about her performance.Alicia superbly transforms herself from sweet and innocent into scary and psychotic giving new meaning to the phrase,'When she was good she was very very good,and when she was bad she was horrid'. The film has you on the edge of your seat as the plot unravels,and truths are discovered about sweet little Darian Forrester who is crazier than anyone thought.Her anger at Nick for leading her on goes to the extreme until she comes up with a plan she hopes will destroy his reputation.Nick is oblivious to Darian's feelings for him and believes its nothing more than a silly school girl crush that will pass until he discovers just how dangerous Darian really is.",
         "It's very hard to understand why this movie is rated so low. I really enjoyed watching this film, which was Silverstone's first major role. She plays a crazy teenager who has a crush on a guy who lives in a guesthouse. In her selfish pursuit of the object of her affection, she makes the guy's life a living hell. She also makes the life miserable for anyone who tries to \"steal\" the guy from her. I think Silverstone fit her role perfectly. The plot was very good as well, and I was always wondering what Silversone's character (Alicia) would do next. This movie gets a solid 8 from me.",
         "This movie has its faults but you can sit back and have fun watching it. It's slow at first. It's not suspenseful but it efficiently uses the short time of action to punch you with thrills. My adrenaline was rushing when Amy got stung by wasps. The direction is so precise that a certain number of seconds can leave you hanging off the sofa. Be careful if you're eating popcorn(or potato chips). You might end up drooling your food on the floor. Nick isn't that smart but I like him because he's nobody's fool. Aside from Cary Elwes and Alicia Silverstone, Kurtwood Smith(That 70's Show) also plays his part very well. The reversal of traditional sexual harassment and discrimination was also interesting.",
         "\"The Crush\" is about a fourteen-year-old girl (Alicia Silverstone) who falls in love with a journalist neighbor, played by Cary Elwes (of \"Saw\" infamy). Elwes rejects her come-ons and after she tries to kiss him gives her a slight warning. However her advances are so strong that after a while he is left dazed, as she accuses him of sexual abuse and has the police arrest him. Destined to clear his name for good, he embarks on a mission to expose her \"crush\" - and prove to everyone once and for all that she's a psychopath. A lot of movies like this were made back in the '80s and '90s starting with \"Fatal Attraction,\" although this is one of the more entertaining ones. As far as the acting goes, Silverstone is very sexy (she was older than 14 during filming so I can say this without coming across as a perv) - she's good at playing a devious flirt. Elwes experiments with his off-again-on-again American accent and the good news is that it's more convincing here than in \"Saw\" (2004). Except for a few scenes, he pretty much sounds convincing. His acting is up to par as well. It's not a great movie but it's entertaining, which is exactly what it should be.",
         "This was Alicia Silverstone's debut film after which she went on to star in some Aerosmith videos (what red-blooded American male can ever forget seeing her and Liv Tyler in \"Crazy\"?) after which she got the lead in Clueless (1995) and the rest is cinematic history. In Clueless of course she was a sweet, adorable and slightly empty-headed Valley Girl. Here she is what might be called a Lolita from hell. Director Alan Shapiro even has her do a Sue Lyon (from Kubrick's 1964 Lolita) looking-over-her-sunglasses imitation to start the film. We soon learn that she is 14 \"almost 15.\" (Silverstone was actually 15-years-old during the filming.) She is also rich and very talented, plays a classical piano, knows the scientific names of beetles and wasps, has skipped two grades, etc. The film itself might be dubbed a kind of \"Fatal Attraction\" for teeny-boppers. Cary Elwes plays Nick Eliot who is looking for some digs as the film begins. He is a writer who just got a gig with an important, trendy magazine. After nearly bumping into Adrian (Silverstone) with his car, he looks askance and sees a sign advertising a cottage for rent in back of a large house with estate. Turns out this is where Adrian lives with her parents. Somehow this reminds me of William Holden as the writer Joe Gillis pulling into that driveway on Sunset Boulevard (1950). He should have looked in the other direction! He should have run the other way! When Little Miss Crazy gets a crush, it is a hum-dinger. Maybe Nick should have just surrendered at the start and she would have been bored with him in a couple of months at most. But unfortunately, Nick Eliot is the epitome of the clueless male. He doesn't see the danger until it is too late. He is slightly compromised because he has kissed her, he has wandered about her house when her parents haven't been at home, and worse yet he doesn't have an inkling of the strength of her passion. To be honest I felt a little sorry for her having to deal with all that rejection! I think this would have played more realistically had Adrian's part been given to an ugly little shrew in the making. But then of course the film would not have found any kind of audience. Well, this is a familiar premise and the kind I like to see worked out and resolved--well, I like to look at Alicia, anyway. Unfortunately Alan Shapiro, who also wrote the script, has the originality of a photocopy machine and just milks the premise while mindlessly escalating the bizarro. Suffice it to say that Little Miss Crazy doesn't take no for an answer and that Nick stupidly behaves in a way that just makes his situation worse. The ending does have the virtue of being nicely ironic while suggesting the hoped-for sequel. (Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",
         "The Crush was one of those movies that I absolutely admired as a kid, I thought this movie was so awesome and intense\u0085 well, I was a kid, give me a little credit. Re-watching this movie, I didn't realize that maybe it wasn't that great of a movie like I had remembered. It was a pretty unoriginal plot, didn't add much of it's own taste or style and was pretty silly over the top. But still I'm not going to diss the film entirely, this was the beginning of Alicia Silverstone's career and she pulls in a strong performance and was very chilling on screen with Cary Elwes. The story may not be original but Alicia and Cary made the story work. Arriving in a new city, writer Nick Eliot secures a job at Pique magazine and lodgings in a guest house belonging to Cliff and Liv Forrester. Nick soon makes the acquaintance of the Forrester's 14-year-old daughter Adrian, a precocious gifted girl who develops an intense attraction to him. She secretly helps Nick by sneaking into his room and rewriting one of his Pique stories, which subsequently wins a rave from his editor/boss Michael. At a party thrown by the Forresters, Nick agrees to accompany the lonely girl on a nightly drive to a romantic spot, where she kisses him. This intensifies Adrian's crush on Nick, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off, having begun a budding romance with co-worker Amy. Adrian continues to boldly pursue him, even going so far as to undress in his view. Nick, however, continues to rebuff her advances, and Adrian's actions become destructive, she smashes a car he's restored and erases his computer discs with his work on it. Then, after Adrian spies on Amy in bed with Nick, you thought Adrian was crazy before, just wait to see what happens next. Over all The Crush is a decent enough movie to watch, I wouldn't dismiss it completely, just if you catch it on TV, check it out. I thought that the scene where Cary is hiding in Alicia's closet to find out what she's really been up too and she knows that he is there, so instead of freaking out, she just undresses in front of him with a seductive look. Also where you see that she has beaten herself up just to get back at Cary's character was very chilling. The Crush has good moments, but it is flawed and in my opinion there are some scenes that could have had a little more, like the hornets that Alicia uses to attack Cary's girlfriend with, afterwards in the hospital, she really doesn't look that injured. But it's mindless entertainment, the new twist on Fatal Attraction, so if you dig these thrillers then The Crush is right up your alley. 5/10",
         "Alternating between gothic horror and hilarious camp, \"The Crush\" is one of the great cult films. Writer/Director Alan Shapiro's young discovery, Alicia Silverstone, delivers her greatest role to date -- no kidding. This is pure fun entertainment, I highly recommend renting it. I will see anything writer/director Alan Shapiro makes.",
         "Alicia's first big film is by far her best. She's gripping, believable and absolutely devilish in the role of little rich witch. Cary Elwes is completely at home in the role of victim as this vortex of terror swirls around him. It's impossible to watch this film without a chill running down your spine. Oh, if only the rest of us could inspire that kind of devotion from our admirers!",
         "The Crush is about a 28 year old journalist named Nick Elliot. He rents a guesthouse and befriends the landlady's beautiful 14 year old daughter Adrian (Alicia Silverstone). Adrian seems lonely, so Nick starts spending a little time with her and he gets to know her better. Nick just sees Adrian as a friend, but Adrian starts obsessing over him and she wants to be more then just friends, much more. And if Adrian can't have Nick, then no one can.. I enjoyed this movie, all the actors did a fine job. I would give The Crush 8/10",
         "So this guy named Nick moves into a guest house of some really rich people and they have a teenage daughter. The daughter seems harmless at first but after a while she becomes a psycho. It isn't totally her fault either because Nick was in her bedroom peeping on her. The movie made it seem like it was all entirely the girls fault but Nick should have looked else where for his picture. Nick also left his front door wide open at all times as well. Other than that, this is a pretty good suspense movie. What happens in the past between the daughter and her old boyfriend was never discussed. It could have made the movie somewhat better but it was pretty good without it."
