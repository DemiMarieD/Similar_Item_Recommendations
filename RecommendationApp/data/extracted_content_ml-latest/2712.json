      "synopsis": "Bill and Alice Harford ( Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) are a wealthy professional couple living in Manhattan whom have been married for nine years. He is a doctor with his own private practice and she is unemployed though she has managed an art gallery in the past. They have a seven-year-old daughter, named Helena ( Madison Eginton), whom they leave with a babysitter for the evening. They attend a Christmas party thrown by wealthy attorney Victor Ziegler ( Sydney Pollack). While Bill flirts with two skinny models, Alice dances and flirts with an unctuous middle-aged Hungarian businessman (Sky Dumont). He attempts to seduce her but she declines because she is married. While at the party, Bill runs into an old friend, Nick Nightingale ( Todd Field), a pianist who tells him to come see him at another gig. Suddenly, Bill is called into Ziegler's private upstairs bathroom for an apparent emergency. Ziegler had been partying with an escort, Mandy ( Julienne Davis). When she shot up a mixture of heroin and cocaine, she passed out, scaring Ziegler. Bill rouses her back to consciousness then chides her about getting into rehab. Ziegler makes Bill promise not to mention the incident to anyone. Alice is troubled by their individual flirtations with other people at the party. The next night, she rolls a joint and they both get stoned. She asks Bill if he had sex with the models the previous night. He denies it but asks about the man she had been dancing with. She says he wanted to have sex with her, which Bill says is understandable. Alice interprets this to mean that she would only be interesting to men if they wanted to have sex with her and begins a discussion about fidelity and sex drives. When Bill claims that women require love before they can have sex and that he has never been concerned she would cheat on him, Alice laughs. She tells him about a fantasy she has had about throwing away her married life in exchange for cheap sex with a naval officer she once saw in a restaurant while with Bill. Their discussion comes to a sudden end when Bill is called away on a house call, but he is troubled by visions of Alice being ravished by the faceless naval officer. The house call is to attend to a patient who just died. The patient's daughter, Marion ( Marie Richardson), confesses to Bill that she is deeply in love with him and needs to be near him, even if she will never get to see him. Bill politely declines her advance, telling her that she is distraught and confused by her father's death. Marion's boyfriend Carl ( Thomas Gibson) arrives which makes Bill leave. Walking home, Bill sees a hooker making out with a john and continues to be plagued by images of his wife being unfaithful. Minutes later, a group of drunken young college men attack Bill and shove him down on the street and accuse him of being gay for no reason. Another few minutes later, a prostitute named Domino ( Vinessa Shaw), propositions him, he reluctantly agrees. Bill and Domino go to her apartment but before they can have sex, Alice calls on his cell phone. He lies that he is still at the patient's house but is unable to go through with the session after hanging up. Continuing his walk, he passes the Sonata Club, where his former medical school chum, Nick Nightingale, is playing piano with a group. Bill decides to stop in to listen. After the music number is up, Nick meets with Bill for drinks at a table. He reveals that he is scheduled to play piano at a sex party later that night and he is waiting for the code word. When Nick takes the phone call on his cell phone telling him where the party will take place and the code word, Bill hectors him for more details -- he wants to attend. Nick reveals the code word and that the orgyists wear costumes. Nick says he's not sure because he's always blindfolded when he plays at the parties. Even though it is after 1:00 a.m. in the morning, Bill walks to a costume shop called \"Rainbow Fashions\" having been the doctor of the previous owner. He offers the new owner, a middle aged European man named Mr. Milich ( Rade Serbedzija) a generous amount of money to rent to him now. In the search for a costume, the owner catches his teenage daughter ( Leelee Sobieski), clad in only her underwear, cavorting with two older Japanese men in a back room. Mr. Milich chases them out and expresses outrage at their lack of sense of decency. He threatens to call the police after he has served Bill. On the way to the party in taxi, Bill continues to fantasize about his wife with the naval officer. Using the password supplied by Nick, he gains access to the party, held at a remote mansion on Long Island. The party features cloaked and mask-clad men and women performing quasi-religious pagan like rituals of pornographic nature, before retiring to watch or participate in a variety of sexual acts in other rooms through the mansion. Nick is seen, blindfolded, playing an electric organ. One masked woman comes to Bill, takes him aside and warns him that he does not belong there. A few minutes later, Bill meets another masked girl in whose company he walks through a few rooms where an orgy is taking place. The first masked woman catches up with Bill and insists he is in terrible danger for the others suspect that he is an outsider. Bill asks the woman her name and why she is telling him this, but she refuses to answer and tells him to leave. Bill refuses and tells the masked woman to leave with him, but she again refuses saying that it could cost her life and maybe his. Bill is then interrupted by a masked porter who tells him that the taxi driver who is waiting outside wants to speak with him. However, the porter takes him to the main room where the masked, red-cloaked Master of Ceremonies confronts Bill with a question about a second password which Bill is unable to answer. The Master of Ceremonies insists that he \"kindly remove his mask\", then asks that he remove his clothes. The just then, the young nudable woman who had tried to warn Bill now intervenes and insists that she be punished instead of him. As she is taken away, Bill asks what is going to happen to her. The Master cryptically replies her fate is sealed. Bill is allowed to leave, but he is also warned not to tell anyone about what happened there or he and his family will suffer dire consequences.. Bill returns home at dawn, guilty and confused. He hides the costume in a locked bureau in his office. Alice is now awake and tells him of a troubling dream in which he and she were in a deserted city without their clothes. She felt frightened and ashamed while he went off to try to find their clothes. After he left, she felt better, finding herself, still naked, in a beautiful garden. The naval officer emerged, stared at her, and the two of them began making love surrounded by many other couples doing the same. She then started having sex with many of those men and laughing at the idea of him seeing her with them. The next morning, Bill goes to a restaurant next door to the Sonata cafe in search of Nick Nightingale where he learns from the waitress and countergirl where Nick is staying. Bill goes to the hotel to see if Nick is all right, and he learns from the front desk clerk ( Alan Cumming) that Nick checked out a few hours ago at around 5:00 a.m. When Bill asks the desk clerk if there was \"anything odd\" about the way Nick checked out, the desk clerk tells Bill that Nick returned to the hotel just before dawn at about 4:30 a.m. and he was accompanied by two well-suited, burly, well-spoken but rough-looking men, one of whom went up to his room with Nick while the other paid for his hotel bill. When Nick came back downstairs with the other man to check out and hand in his room key, the desk clerk tells Bill that Nick tried to pass an envelope to him, but one of the men noticed this and he intercepted and took it away before Nick could tell him what to do with it. The two men then appeared to forcibly take Nick and his luggage into a waiting limousine parked outside the hotel and was driven away by with the two men, with no mention as to where they were going. The desk clerk also tells Bill that Nick also appeared to be frightened, and he also had one or more bruises on his face which may have been the cause of being beaten up. A little later that day, Bill goes to return the costume to Rainbow Fashions, but the mask is missing. So the proprietor, Milich, adds the missing mask to Bill's charge. Milich's daughter and the two Japanese men appear again for a few seconds before leaving. Milich's daughter is still in her underwear, but her flirty demeanor towards Bill is replaced by a glassy stare. With his daughter by his side, Mr. Milich states he can do other favors for Bill \"and it needn't be a costume\". Milich now makes clear to Bill that he pimps his daughter and implies that he may have sold her to the Japanese businessmen. More disturbed then ever, Bill returns to the site of the party, where he is given a note at the front gate... addressed to him. Although the people there saw his face, he had never told anyone at the party his name. The note tells Bill to stop trying to learn more about the previous night's events and to not only stay away, but stay quiet about what happened and to consider the note his \"second warning\". Though the rest of the day, Bill cannot get Alice's dream of orgiastic infidelity out of his head. After Bill returns home from work, he thinks about Alice's recounting of the scene while he watches her instruct her daughter in math. After dinner, Bill lies to Alice about having appointments at his office that very night night. He goes to see Domino but when she is not home, he tries to seduce Sally, Domino's roommate ( Fay Masterson). Instead she tells him that Domino has disappeared after learning she is HIV-positive. Bill then attempts to call Marion, but hangs up when her boyfriend, Carl, answers the phone. Walking down a street, brooding, Bill sees that a well-dressed stranger is following him from across the street. Bill ducks into a nearby coffee shop and apparently loses his pursuer. There, Bill reads an article from a discarded newspaper, the New York Post, that Mandy, a former beauty queen, was found dead of a drug overdose in a hotel room that morning. Using his doctor's credentials, Bill goes to the morgue to confirm the body is hers. He realizes that Mandy was the woman he attended to at the Christmas party two nights earlier because of her drug overdose, and she was also the same masked woman who tried to warn him during the orgy and Bill now fears that she died to protect him. As he is leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call on his cell phone from Ziegler who wants to meet with him. In Ziegler's apartment, he pleads with Bill to stop trying to find out more about the orgy and investigating the secret society that held it. Ziegler was one of the attendees himself and saw everything that happened at the party. Ever since then, Ziegler was the one who had Bill followed because his own position with the group has been jeopardized by Bill's intrusion thanks to Nick telling Bill about the event. Ziegler tells Bill that beyond voyeurism and sex, nothing untoward happened at the party. All of the warnings and the trial, Ziegler suggests, were staged to frighten Bill into keeping quiet. The people who held the party are important, powerful people who want to protect their privacy, Ziegler tells Bill. They found Bill and his identity out because of his own sloppiness (Bill showing up in a taxi whereas everyone else showed up in limousines, plus the receipt for the costume rental was found in his coat pocket), and not through any evil or supernatural designs. On top of that, Ziegler tells Bill that the second password he was asked never existed for it was only a ruse to trick Bill into revealing his status as a trespasser. Bill is now concerned with the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the woman at the party as well as the same woman from the orgy who \"sacrificed\" herself to prevent Bill's punishment, as well as the disappearance of Nick. Ziegler claims that Nick is safely back in Seattle (but doesn't know where to get ahold of him), and Mandy wasn't killed to save Bill. She was simply a prostitute who had a bad drug problem and she indeed died from an accidental drug overdose and there was no foul play at all by stating \"life goes on\". Bill clearly does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth, but he accepts it anyway. Bill returns home. He finds his mask from the orgy lying on his pillow next to a sleeping Alice. He breaks down and tells her everything. Alice cries over what she hears. The next morning, Bill and Alice take their daughter Christmas shopping at a local store. In a private moment, Bill asks Alice what they should do about their problems. She is grateful that they have both survived their recent real-life and dream-life flirtations with infidelity, but stops short of promising eternal love and faithfulness on her part. In the meantime, she suggests, they should get home and \"fuck\" as soon as possible.",

         "I'm sitting here trying to come up with a clever comment about this movie to make you want to see it. When in reality it doesn't matter what I say. As Stallone would say \"I'm at least half a bum.\" The truth to it is, it kind of makes me sad that I'll probably never see another movie that affects so much. Never experience a film that 6 years after it's release, I still can not forget. To say the most, it's a powerful film. The directing is world class. The camera work is haunting and the soundtrack gives me chills. It's Cruise at his finest. He is so convincing that one might actually believe that this guy is Doctor Bill Harford and this really did happen to him. And that my friends is the definition of acting. The seriousness of the situation fades away with a stern smile as the plot thickens. To say the least it is one of those movies you could watch over and over again. To be honest with you, I didn't buy it the first time I saw it. I thought it was good, but not great. Then one day I was bored, so I decided to see it again. And that's when it happened. Kubrick came alive. I became infected by his genius and captivated by Cruise's portrayal. His realization and his detail. It's hard to pick my favorite scene in the movie. I couldn't pretend if I tried. I particularly love the opening party scene. That leads to a \"Baby did a bad bad thing\". Cruise being assaulted on the street being so eloquently called a fag. The prostitute. From the piano bar to the costume shop. And finally, the unionized orgy party, that I find hard to believe doesn't really exist. Maybe only guys like Kubrick or Cruise will ever really know if they do or not. Many people might disagree with me when I say Eyes Wide Shut is one of the greatest films. But how come I think it is every time I watch it? To me, it's more than a beautiful work of art. More than a visceral painted picture or a haunting melody. It's a masterpiece that should be treasured.",
         "Eyes Wide Shut is ill-suited for the summer movie corridor. It has no explosions, no running, shouting, or a single gunshot. What it has are long scenes in which characters talk to one another. Slowly and carefully. The problem is that the film is marketed as having white-hot sex scenes and plenty of gratuitous nudity, while it has neither. There is plenty of naked flesh, don't get me wrong, but in exactly the opposite way that the ads make it appear. This is not a movie about being sexy and naked -- it's a movie about how flesh is just another part of being human, so what is all the fuss about? The marketing campaign is misleading, and led to disappointment in the audience that I saw the movie with, who were just looking for some skin. The tension in the plot and the issues that the film discusses aren't telegraphed to the audience, they're hinted at in the dialog. There is no neat resolution at the end, life simply goes on. You may watch the whole film and think \"that wasn't about anything!\" Then think about what you've seen and realize it has a great deal to say. The film is a meditation on sexuality and how it relates to marriage, death, and money. It's a fascinating commentary on modern life, and a rare movie that dares to examine sex as impassionately as any other issue. The directing and cinematography alone would be worth the price of admission without the social commentary. The sets are an integral part of the movie; they breathe and glow and live. Kubrick was a master director, and he uses long shots and dissolves to great effect. Cruise and Kidman are at their best, and the supporting cast is also strong. It's Kubrick's magic work with the camera that holds the film together. All in all, definitely worth seeing for the un-uptight. It's possible to watch this film and actually think about it for hours afterward. That's something you won't get with the Wild, Wild West.",
         "There is no denying that Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live. He may not have made many films, but every single one of them is a masterpiece. That is not something that can be said about many other directors. He is a true artist. And it is because of that word, \"art\", that his work is often misunderstood. Rather than create films which reveal everything that the audience needs to know through the dialogue or the action, Kubrick layers his films with meaning. He does this through all aspects of the film.. the music, the images, the dialogue, and expressions. And by the end of the film, nothing is left clear, because he wants you to think about what you have seen, and come up with your own meaning for the film. The problem with this is that most people don't go to see films to think, they just want to see the next \"Armageddon\" or \"Waterboy\". So, if \"Eyes Wide Shut\" fails at the box-office, or is badly criticized by movie-goers, it has nothing to do with the film itself, but is more reflective of the movie-goers, and their inability to see further than what is presented to them on the screen. Life experience and a philosophical mind is also required to fully understand and enjoy this film. If you have ever thought of what role sex plays in your relationship, and what love and commitment really mean, you will understand this film. If you have ever considered what the difference between love and sex is, you will understand this film. If you have ever truly felt lust, you will understand this film. Be prepared to think.",
         "I managed to swallow my expectations before the film, setting myself to judge it on its own without judging it as a Kubrick film. No need, no need! This film IS a Kubrick film, without any doubt, and as all Kubrick films are it was absolutely stunning. Absolutely. Visually it is brilliant, though I should warn that this isn't quite as visual a film as most other Kubrick works. A lot of the film focuses on the characters, on human interaction, something rather new to this director. Of course, all the Kubrick trademarks are there, cold analytical gazes, sharp introspection. Tom Cruise seems like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and even Malcolm MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' at times, a rather striking fact considering that this is Tom Cruise. The performances were excellent all around, even from places not expected. Again, this is typical for Kubrick. He wasn't much of a people director, but he still knew how to direct people. Almost every moment of this film was flawless, perfect and pristine. The dialog is predictable, but in some solemn and holy fateful sort of way, as though the words and the moments are matched so essentially that nothing else could possibly fit. Beyond that the sounds and images all fit together beautifully, creating an almost unblemished whole. The only part that didn't seem right was the sequence that had been digitally altered. While the alterations were not nearly so obtrusive as I had feared (not knowing about them one probably wouldn't notice them) they do grow a bit noticeable for redundancy (you see a lot more backs than you'd expect, and always in the same places). Unfortunately these came right in the middle of one of the most visually amazing pieces of the film (one of the most amazing pieces of cinema as a whole, in my opinion), a very unwelcome distraction. Is this movie about sex? Yes, it is, but more importantly it is about people. The sex part is simply a product thereof. This is one of the most disturbingly honest portraits of human behavior and motivations ever made. The most honest I've ever seen, at least. To be put simply: It is about sex because people are about sex. I'm still trying to sort through this movie. It's been a good twelve hours since I saw it, and I can still feel it, hard and definite, rotating in my stomach. The film itself seems mostly void of opinion (not entirely, but mostly), serving more as a general statement and commentary than any specific moral warning, but the questions it inspires are very strong indeed. The film, being objective, provides no answers, no justification for humanity. There is no redemption, either, none whatsoever. The film's final word sums it (it being the film and humanity) up pretty well, for better or for worse. I guess that depends on you. A common thread in Kubrick's films since 2001 has been the contemplation and examination of human intentions, the essence of human behavior. Motivations. He's shown us violence and madness and everything else, all tracking the path back to the dawn of man. I think he finally figured it out with this film, however anticlimactic the discovery might have been. At least he did finally figure it out. That's something. I am one of many. I never had the privilege to know Stanley Kubrick. I don't even know that privilege is the right word. I do know his films, though, and while I am in no position to say that I will miss him as a person, I can say, without doubt or hesitation, that I will miss him as a filmmaker.",
         "***SPOILER ALERT - I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS MOVIE! *** It's a shame that this film was promoted as a \"hot\" erotic thriller. Kubrick would not have allowed that marketing campaign to go forward had he been alive. Sure there's a lot of eroticism in this movie, but those who go to it looking for sexual thrills are going to be (and were) sorely disappointed. The events in this movie are triggered by the protagonist's wife's revelation that she almost slept with another man. This kicks off a range of emotions and prompts him to re-evaluate his sexual relationship with her, subsequently leading to a trip through his sexual SUBconscious. This is the critical point that all too many viewers miss, though it's so overtly surreal I don't see how one could miss it. None of this is real! It's called Eyes Wide SHUT for a reason! All of our protagonists' \"encounters\" represent manifestations of his sexual fantasies and fears. His fantasies include group sex, sex with a teenager, sex with a prostitute, sex without strings. His fears include disease, homosexuality (notice the brutal and brief encounter with the gay-bashing gang), and most of all: discovery. Discovery of his hidden fantasies, which might reveal his true nature to the world. Discovery that he is really a pretender, doesn't really belong, and is not worthy after all. This latter is probably universal, and in his case while it has sexual dimensions it is not purely sexual. In the end he realizes that his fantasies are just fantasies, at least some of his fears are legitimate, and that instead of just fantasizing about sex he should actually have sex with his wife. Not rocket science here, but plenty of people need reminding of this from time to time, and it's a well-told story. I was fortunate enough to first see this movie in theaters overseas, and was spared the atrocity of digital editing to make things less explicit. David Lynch did the same thing more recently in Mulholland Drive, and I hope that this is not the beginning of a trend. Given all of the explicit gore and brutality in movies, the level of sexual explicitness that triggers the censors is simply laughable. Frankly, having seen the un-edited version, I didn't think it was a big deal. One can't dismiss criticisms that the nudity was all female and many of the women were depicted as sexual objects, but this movie is quite pointedly a trip through a fairly conventional man's sexual unconscious and necessarily told from a male point of view. So none of these things should be a surprise. It would be very interesting to see a comparable exploration of the female sexual subconscious by an accomplished woman director, though I'm not holding my breath that the Hollywood establishment will allow that to happen soon.",
         "The thing a lot of folks haven't liked about Stanley Kubrick's films is the fact that he always seemed to think the audience needed some points driven home a little harder than others. Very little is left for debate; most everything is spelled out, pressed hard, and dwelled upon. His critics have compared the long waits between his films to the long periods of waiting that occur while watching his films. Personally, I like the long, slow scenes in his films. When they're filled with something: music, movement, thought, memory of a previous scene, dread, or any other emotion, they can never really be said to be empty. I like them because, with Kubrick, I can be sure that they're absolutely essential to his ultimate vision. He could have put out a six-hour documentary on tissue manufacturing; at least I'll know that not one minute of screen time is wasted. \"Eyes Wide Shut\" isn't as vacuous as, say, \"Barry Lyndon\" or \"The Shining.\" Compared to those two, this one scoots along like a person trying to get to his car in the rain. It'll try a lot of folks' patience, I'm sure -- even his most loyal fans will be bothered by the incessant piano \"bell tolls\" in the soundtrack of some scenes, or the constant reminders (in imaginary flashbacks) that Cruise's character is bothered by his wife's near-infidelity. I know I was. Despite that, it's an apt final film for the long, glorious career of a man who has done more for the cinema, with less movies, than can ever be catalogued. To try and cite influences for this particular work is futile. Though one might draw parallels to Lindsay Anderson's \"O Lucky Man!\" or Martin Scorsese's \"After Hours,\" \"Eyes Wide Shut\" is no less than a complete work from the cold heart and brilliant mind of Stanley Kubrick alone. It's also a furiously ingenious piece of filmmaking, one that works less on the emotions than on the senses and on the mind. Unlike most of Kubrick's earlier work, however, it does have an emotional subtext, which is used to devastating effect. Cruise, by the way, does an outstanding job, not as a trained, camera-conscious film actor, but as a mature, seasoned performer. Here he uses his \"Top Gun\"/\"Jerry Maguire\" suavity to malicious effect; like Ryan O'Neal's Barry Lyndon before him, he's an egotistical cad. Unlike Lyndon, he gains our sympathy -- that's key to keeping us from disowning his character and thus negating the entire film. Kidman is given less screen time, but it matters little. She's mostly seen in the beginning, and she has brief (but crucial) scenes throughout, and a masterful one at the end. It is safe to say that this is her best performance to date, and those of us who have been ignoring her treasured abilities up until now (the Academy, critics, myself) will be astounded to see how far she's come since \"Dead Calm.\" Her high points: the argument with her husband that ends by setting the film's plot in motion perfectly captures the way women lure men into arguments when the cause for one is nonexistent (and on Cruise's part, how men can't think fast enough to do anything about it), and her dream confession scene, in which she wakes laughing but becomes tearful during recollection. On a technical level, \"Eyes Wide Shut\" displays Kubrick's trademark perfectionism. Recreating Vietnam in rural England for \"Full Metal Jacket\" must have been nearly impossible, but the unrelenting accuracy in recreating uptown and downtown New York City is absolutely stunning. Right down to the diners and the newspaper stands; I shake my head in awe when I remind myself that Kubrick (a native Brooklynite) hasn't been to NYC in decades. The lighting and photography is impeccable, also, as it is in every one of his films. This is the sort of film one sees more than once. Once is good to cleanse the palate, to clear out all the residual toxins left from other recent films. See it again, perhaps a third time, and get to appreciate the graceful, nearly unblemished finale of a man who took the art of cinema seriously. It's a sobering experience.",
         "I admit that I'm part of the Kubrick cult(people that follow his movies like a religion), and I was first in line to see this movie. Being a huge movie fan I've seen a wide variety of movies, and have walked away from them with a wide variety of emotions. This was the first movie to put me in a trance, or dream, like state. The way the movie was shot, lighted, and so on gave the feel of a dream (to me at least). I believe that this feel is just what was needed and what Kubrick wanted. Everyone has to admit to thinking about the dark side of sex, and I believe that in this movie we see that a person can explore the buried desires of their sexual id and still come away a good person. I'm guessing that this was a very personal movie for Kubrick. He seemed to take Cruise's character to places that he, personally, wished he could explore. Places, like a prostitute or an orgy, that he'd like to visit, but not want to stay at very long. Praise has to go to Cruise and Kidman for their performances. Cruise was able to strip away his movie star veneer that seems to protect him in all of his other movies, and bring through the clouded, tormented, and unsure heart of a jealous man. Kidman must have known that part of her role was to be eye candy, but she fought through that and gave the movie's best performance. To anyone out there thinking about seeing the movie.....I say go. Some will hate it and others will love it, but half the fun of the movie lies in the discussions that will blossom from this great movie experience.",
         "Stanley Kubrick was tempted to do \"Eyes Wide Shut\" in 1970, but Christianne, his wife, felt that her marriage could be in jeopardy, so she implored him not to do it... But \"Eyes Wide Shut\" came to be after all, the last temptation of Kubrick... The film begins revealing the nice figure in high heels of Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), moving in sliding motion her nice black gown... Alice is invited with her husband Dr. William (Tom Cruise) to a holiday party given by a New York wealthy broker called Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). While Alice is dancing half-drunk with an effusive Hungarian (Ski Dumont), she was, at the same time, spying on her husband who was flirting with two models... A ménage à trois is insinuated by the attractive girls, but a sudden interruption comes from Ziegler's private apartment which made the doctor climb upstairs to assist an attractive woman lying unconscious, repressed, overdosed! The famous mirror love scene, between Alice and her husband, reflected a missing sexual desire between them both... William was kissing his lovely wife on the neck while her glance seemed weary and tired... It seems that the eroticism has vanished from her boring life... Only a little intimate contact is left... Is she truly recognizing a necessity for a change, maybe for a new husband much more nearby... Looking for a certain sexual vengeance, Alice begins irritating her husband about adultery by testing his immunity, and relating some fantasy she had with a handsome naval officer last summer, she assures William that 'if the handsome office had wanted her,' she would have sacrificed everything, even her marriage and her child for one night stand! Feeling his word destroyed into fragments, and walking the dangerous streets of New York, William remembered an old friend he met in the party, the piano player Todd Field (Nick Nightingale). He decides to pass by... There, Nick divulges a secret... A secret place on Long Island... A château where he will be playing piano 'eyes shuttered'... But he continued, to get into the castle, one must have a mask, a disguise and he must 'know' the password... With shades of Hitchcock's \"Vertigo,\" Kubrick starts to play, at this point, with his characters... He seems escorting them and leading the audience for some purpose, for one definite performance he prepared his whole picture for it... Kubrick did not create a film about sex... He made a film about the conception of sex... He wanted us to explore something inside our mind that we usually prefer not to discover... Through his eyes a visual work appeared, a cinematic technique breathtakingly beautiful, a perfectionism, precise and mystical... Reducing the dialog to a minimum, and with a distinguished confused music, we were in presence of a strange ceremonial rite, a picturesque ritual... Based on a psychological drama, written by the Viennese novelist Arthur Schnizler, \"Eyes Wide Shut\" is a mirror, audaciously obsessive in its dazzling revelations, profound, provocative and passionate, transmitted in a frame of sex, fear and death, that we have to see with wide eyes fully opened...",
         "After three years of waiting, EYES WIDE SHUT has finally come out. So now after all this time, the delays, the rumors, the teases, the sad death of its director, Stanley Kubrick, we finally get to answer the question, Does it live up to the hype? For the first time this year, the answer to that question is a resounding yes. This is, so far, the best film I've seen this year, and it deserves its place among other Kubrick masterpieces like DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Although I had been looking forward to this film, I must admit I was unsure about it at first. After all, since CLOCKWORK, Kubrick's films(BARRY LYNDON, THE SHINING, and FULL METAL JACKET), while having some good parts, have all been somewhat flawed, particularly THE SHINING. But my misgivings were quickly put to rest within the opening scenes, where we get a glimpse of both what's right on the surface(nine happy years of marriage, wealth, a healthy 7 year old daughter, both husband and wife with jobs) and the possibility of storms that lurk underneath(the practiced way they get ready for the party, hardly looking at each other), and I stayed enthralled throughout. Now I'd like to use this forum to deflect some of the criticisms I've read of the movie so far. One, of course, is that this is not really New York City, but a soundstage in England. I've lived in New York City and visited several times, and the surface details seem right, but more importantly, this is set in the \"rich\" area of Manhattan, which has always been idealized in movies(particularly the Woody Allen ones), and thus it's appropriate in a dream-like movie to play to the fantasy of the city, rather than the reality. Secondly, we are given no hint that this is a dream Cruise's character may be walking in, since it looks so real(yes, that's inconsistent with the criticism up above, but to be fair, I've only seen a couple of reviews which make that mistake). First of all, dreams rarely look like they were designed by Salvador Dali(at least, my dreams). Secondly, if the whole nighttime sequence looked like a dream and nothing else, we would laugh when Cruise goes back to the various places he visited at night; how would he know to go back to them if they weren't real? Finally, in the way the narrative unspools, it's played like a dream, complete with scene where he might be awakening(the scene with Domino(Vinessa Shaw), the prostitute, where his cell phone rings and Kidman is on the phone right before he can do any damage). Thirdly, that Kidman is only in the film for 40 minutes of its 2 hour, 40 minute running length. Now granted, that is all of her screen time, but when Cruise enters his \"dream state\", she is always in back of his mind, not just in the flashback scenes(when he imagines her having sex with the sailor she had fantasies about), but in the fact that all the other women he comes across are meant to make him think of Kidman. And her performance is certainly strong enough(especially in her monologues) to linger in the mind. Fourth, that Cruise is completely flat here. Again, at least in the dreams I've had and read about, often in dreams we react to events, not provoke them, and that's what his character does. Secondly, Kubrick and Cruise play off of his image, to make him the object of desire of everyone he meets, and not just women(I like to think the scenes where he's harassed by a group of teenage thugs who think he's gay, and where hotel concierge Alan Cumming seems to be coming on to him, are Kubrick's way of joking about the rumors of Cruise being gay which have dogged him). For all of that, I think he plays it exactly right. Finally, that the film is flat and not really sexy. Once again, unless it's a nightmare, dreams aren't played at MTV speed. Secondly, contrary to what we heard at first about the film, this isn't about sex. Rather, this is about sexual obsession, so it's not supposed to be about sex the act. It may seem like the film cheats a little by asking us to play off our expectations of Cruise and Kidman as a couple, so we just picture in our heads them having sex, rather than us seeing it, but isn't it good that some things are left to our imagination? Besides, it's only on the surface that things look good, as I said before. Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to read DREAM STORY, the novella this is based on, and so have no answer to those who claim this is a poor adaptation(though what some have called stilted dialogue I think adds to the dreamlike quality, and I'm normally on the lookout for flat dialogue), and that may be true. But this is an excellent film, a fitting epitaph for Kubrick, and proof once again that Cruise can act when he's teamed with a real director.",
         "One of the most under-rated films of the decade, Eyes Wide Shut is a brilliant masterpiece, from the very opening of the film to its very end. Kubrick succeeds in what many good filmmakers failed before him- and conveys a beautiful imagery of our state of dreams, full of sexual symbolism and other dream-like symbols (notice the stop signs in the streets in front of Tom Cruise), and creates a feeling of total wandering; although consistent, due to the fact that every scene and dialogue is vital and neccecary for the film's development. Moreover, Kubrick's use of music is even more genius than always, and Ligeti's motif from Musica Ricercarta shows us the repetitive nature of dreams, together with a feeling that we don't know where to go next. And of course there is a note of marriage life, men's sexuality (and the attempt to deny women's sexuality) and the very fine acting of Cruise and Kidman, which was a postlude of there own relationship. For me, this is the finest, most perfect film of Kubrick, and therefore one of the best films of all. A must see! 10/10"
