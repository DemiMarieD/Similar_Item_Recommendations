         "Actually, after seeing the rating on Halloween 6, I have to admit that I was a bit scared to see this movie, not because it's a horror story, but because it just had a low rating. But still I wanted to complete the Halloween series and when I rented this movie, I was really surprised that I liked it as much as I did. I think the rating is a bit harsh, this story brought us back into the story with Jamie, even though a warning in advance, she does get killed off with this sequel, I liked how they continued the story with one of the original characters, Tommy Doyle. It was cool to see him grown up and how the events of 1978 effected him. Honestly I don't know why this movie has a lower rating than Halloween 5, but I guess to each his own, but I really do think this story carries itself a lot better. Michael Myers, his niece Jamie Lloyd, and the mysterious Man in Black have all been in hiding for six years. It is revealed that the Man in Black is the leader of a Druid-like cult, and the Man in Black kidnapped Jamie and had her impregnated. The baby is born on Halloween Eve and is carried away by the Man in Black. Later that night, a nurse helps Jamie and her baby escape. Michael Myers, in pursuit of Jamie and her newborn, kills the nurse. Jamie, meanwhile, steals the truck and flees to a dark and empty bus station where she calls in to a radio show that happens to be doing a broadcast about the Haddonfield murders. Jamie gets on the air, begging for help and warning of Michael's imminent return. Beaten and exhausted, she makes her way inside of an old barn where Michael is waiting for her. He kills Jamie, only to find that Jamie does not have the baby. Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle has his eye on a family who's moved into the old Myers house across the street from the boarding house where he lives. The boarding house is run by a mysterious old woman named Minnie. Tommy has been obsessed with finding the truth behind the murderous motives of Michael Myers. After hearing Jamie begging for help on a local radio show, Tommy finds her baby at the bus station and takes him into hiding. The people living in the Myers house are relatives of the Strode family, and among the current residents are Kara Strode and her son Danny. The plot takes a turn when the Man in Black finally reveals himself as Dr. Wynn from the original Halloween. Wynn has been experimenting with pure evil, does he think this is a good idea? Happy Halloween. Granted, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is very different than the other Halloween stories, but I think this was a good pick up. Plus you have to admit that Jamie's death is very effective and scary. The whole cult thing was a bit much, but still I think it was a good scare factor to add into the story. The acting is better I think and the writing was a little more accurate. Plus unlike Halloween 5, Michael actually scared me again, thank God, I was getting a little frightened that he was loosing his touch and his butcher knife. So I do recommend this movie if you're looking to complete the series or if you're just looking for a good scare. 6/10",
         "Halloween 666 (1995) The producer's cut review! Halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to Part five. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really blow your mind. A mysterious \"Man in Black\" has raided the Haddonfield Police Department freeing Micheal Myers. In the process poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. What they want with her? Who knows, but let's just say her long suffering will end soon. Doctor Loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing any more innocents (good luck). A friend of Loomis, Doctor Wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor. Another old face from part one guest stars as well. This dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing. For some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn't worth the average horror film watcher's time. So they decide to dumb it down. Then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office. No matter what they did to the film, they made it worse. They should have left well enough alone. Hey, the film company knows better than the filmmakers now....don't they? Producer's Cut :Highly recommended Released version: Not recommended",
         "This was a really interesting Halloween film. I wasnt to thrilled with the whole Thorn theory but it still makes for a good film. I liked getting to see Tommy Doyle back but sadly Donald Pleasance died right after shooting. The film had a really REALLY bad director who didnt give a flip about the series, from what I heard treated Donald bad, and wouldnt let Danielle Harris come back as Jamie. Its like he was just trying to bring down the film, but I still liked it. There were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the Producers Cut which features over 40 min. of never before scenes. With those scenes it turns into a whole new movie. Check it out if you have the chance.",
         "This movie is pretty good as it is, but the unreleased Producer's Cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. Jamie's story is handled differently, the death scenes are done 10 times better, there's more footage of ritual type stuff giving more story about Micheal, Jamie and her baby. There is also an alternate ending which is also better. Why they didn't release this version instead I have no damned clue. If you can find this version, see it.",
         "'Halloween VI: The Curse of Michael Myers' is easily one of the best entries in the series that has a lot of good things going for it. **SPOILERS** A young woman, Jamie Lloyd (J.C. Brandy) gives birth to a baby and is stalked though a sanitarium by Michael Myers. Jamie escapes the sanitarium into a driving rainstorm, stealing a truck. Michael follows her as Jamie's sister, Kara (Marianne Hagan) tries to calm her son Danny (Devin Gardner) about the rain. One of the original children Laurie Strode babysitted in the first 'Halloween,' Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd) warns that Michael is still alive as Michael tracks Jamie down to a bus station outside Haddonfield. She escapes, but Michael kills her later on. Tommy finds the baby Jamie hid from Michael in the bus station, as Kara and her friend Beth (Mariah O'Brien) plan to throw a Halloween party in Haddonfield. While Tommy seeks advice from Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) about Michael and the baby, Michael stalks Kara's family. With the help of Tommy, Kara pieces together what is actually going on. She learns that a Celtic ritual is encouraging Michael to kill. While the town is at a Halloween party in Haddonfield, Beth runs off with her boyfriend and gets killed. Kara watches, then goes over to get Danny back as he ventures over. Kara knocks Michael out and escapes with Danny and Loomis. They are all taken hostage by Loomis' friend, Dr. Wynn (Mitch Ryan) who wants the baby to be the ultimate sacrifice made to Michael to finally get him under control. Kara is then taken to an old medical facility where Loomis and Tommy break in and fight off Michael's repeated attempts to kill them. The Good News: This is a really suspenseful movie. The beginning of this is really creepy. There is a giant sense of unnervingness about what's going to happen next. The scenes are very well put together that do lead logically from one event to the next that keep you riveted to the seat, or by now a chair, wondering when someone or something's going to pop out next. I can't rate the first twenty minutes of this film with enough praise, as it is surely entertaining, unique, and very watchable. The rest of the film does have more of an honest attempt to be more suspenseful that previous entries. When Kara returns home after Michael has killed a family member or the first defense against Michael are really quite inventive and frightening. There are tons of scenes where the character slows down their actions to go slowly, giving the impression that it will spook the audience. Michael does have a ton of truly great kills, almost as great of kills than the first one. I can't reveal what he does to people in this one, but they are really inventive. Almost every single death is different, and they are some deaths where Myers never even uses his knife. The plot is really fast paced, where something happens every few minutes. I also have to say that I love Michael's new mask in this one. It is still distinctly Michael, but it has this Leatherface-ish quality to it. The mask looks very much like a mask of human skin simply covered white that looks very creepy that adds to his new persona. He has a return to his roots with his behavior. He has a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly at his victim with no remorse offered to his victims, which are easily the goriest kills in the whole series. The Bad News: I don't know why I'm picking on this, but I hate the total unrealisticness of how Myers moved in this movie. In one second, he moves very slowly, taking his time to stalk someone and then he stops to admire his work before continuing on to the next victim. I prefer that image of Michael, being the slow stalker and unmerciful killer that he has always been. However, he sometimes moved a little differently. There are a couple of scenes where he moves very fast, as if they moved the camera speeds to catch him at a different rate of movement. It sounds and looks weird, but those who have seen it know. Despite the fast plot, it is very confusing. It took a few turns to fully understand the whole effect of what goes on in the movie. The Final Verdict: If you can get around the confusing reason why this film was made, you will find a great film here. It is high-action, high gore and high body count throwback horror film from the 80's with a 90's approach to it. It is an underrated masterpiece in the Halloween saga. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a very brief sex scene.",
         "For some reason, I always enjoy movies that people hate, when I really don't think they're that bad - and this is one of those films. In the case of this movie, I think it is way too over-criticized, I really isn't that bad of a film at all. In fact, I think this is one of the better sequels. \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" begins on the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally murders Jamie Lloyd (who was taken captive by the \"Man In Black\" in part 5) after she gives birth to his baby. We are then introduced to the Strode family, who is now coincidentally living in the old Myers house (which seems to change in each film). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, the now adult boy who survived the original killings. They must fight together to save Jamie's baby from an evil cult that takes care of Michael, while Michael himself is driven to kill by an old Celtic ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in Haddonfield. This is surely one of the best sequels in the series, in my opinion anyway, and I can't understand all of the hate it has gotten. It had some nice suspense, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I'll admit), some scary moments here and there, and plenty of gore and knife slashings to appease all of you gorehounds. Not all of the acting wasn't particularly great, but it was convincing enough for me. Marianne Hagan is the leading lady and she is very likable. Paul Rudd plays a grown-up Tommy Doyle, and is also very talented and plays his part nicely. The rest of the supporting cast (besides the brilliant Donald Pleasance) isn't much to praise, but it wasn't too bad either, all things considered. I'm still not sure if giving an explanation for why Michael kills was completely necessary, but it turned out to be okay in the end and I wasn't upset with the way they tied everything together. The open-ended conclusion was also kind of eerie, but could have been something more. I have also seen the infamous \"Producer's Cut\" of this film, the original cut of it, and I think that in some respects, it is better. It further explains the Thorn curse that drives Michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film, plus the ending was a lot better in my opinion. It felt more natural than the conclusion that we're given in the studio cut of the film. I wish that Dimension would release this alternate version of the film, because I personally think it is better. The chances of that are very slim though. Overall, \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" is a very good sequel and will please all of the fans of the series. This movie isn't the best of all horror movies, but it's definitely worth renting if you want to see Michael do his thing. Just don't expect brilliance, and you'll enjoy it. 7/10.",
         "Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie with one of them loving it and the other one hating it. As it concerns 'Halloween:the Curse of Michael Myers' I fall into the latter category. I'm of the opinion that John Carpenter, in 1978, made one of that decade's finest fright films, which despite its flaws, still holds up well into the 21st century. It reused many of the old horror film devices but utilized them in original and effective ways. It had no pretensions that it was anything other than a movie about an escaped mental patient stalking babysitters on Halloween night. And yet there were 'ideas' in the film but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into your skull. It juxtaposed the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was taking place in the story and it did this with a wonderful ambiguity. The 'filmmakers' of this 'film' probably wouldn't even understand that previous paragraph. That's why we're saddled us with this miserable and inept piece of disposable celluloid. Direction, script, acting are of the lowest strata imaginable. This is the type of film that is so mind numbingly dull and nausea inducing as to make you want to crawl back into the womb and die. It is also truly, truly sad to see veteran British actor Donald Pleasence wasting his acting abilities with this saliva puddle of a movie. He seems drained of all his energy and resigned to the fact that this may be his last film. Maybe that's what killed him.",
         "Wow, \"The Curse of Michael Myers\" what a great film. Suspenseful, entertaining, creative and a clever plot which I love. Many hate the 'Thorn' concept, I love it. I think that it gives the Halloween series some plot. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance, especially for her first film and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are great also. My only complaint is that why wasn't Danielle Harris in this film as Jamie? She wanted to return, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Still, I love Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape's mask looks the best in this film and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly creepy and suspenseful, Halloween 6 rules! I adore this very violent, but immensely enjoyable film. The Halloween horror series - by far the best in the Genre. 10 out of 10.",
         "What made Myers so scary was the fact that you didn't know what drove him to such insanity or made him indestructable. Trying to explain his origins would have been a tough thing to do right, and this doesn't come close. Does this film bore? no, but had they kept the producer's cut instead of this version it might have been worthy.",
         "This movie has its share of flaws: heavy doses of graphic gore, that almost degrade a series which began with a gore-less film, and moments that simply don't make sense - why does Myers kill his \"collaborators\" at the end? Still, I found the attempts to explain his origin mostly fascinating. It's the easiest, the laziest and the greediest thing to present a killer without a motive and to keep bringing him back for more sequels even though he should be dead. Why do people say that this series never contained supernatural elements? When Myers is shot six times in \"Halloween\" and nevertheless lives, was that \"natural\"? Script and direction were a bit muddled, but not TOO muddled: I've never seen \"Halloween 5\", yet the plot made sense to me, even if some details didn't. The classic music score has been unfortunately altered, but as a whole this sixth entry seems to be somewhat underrated - \"Halloween II\" is much more boring. Fair acting, too."
