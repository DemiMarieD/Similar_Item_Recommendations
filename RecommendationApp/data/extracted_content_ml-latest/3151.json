      "synopsis": "The Bat has struck again, making off with a priceless necklace even after warning the police that he would rob the safe at precisely 1 a.m., after which he intends to go to country in order to give the police a rest. On his way through the village of Oakdale, the Bat notices someone robbing the Oakdale bank. Intrigued, the Bat follows the robber, who leads him to the old Fleming mansion. Inside the Fleming mansion, Cornelia van Gorder [Grayce Hamptom] and her ditzy maid Lizzie Allen [Maude Eburne] are discussing Cornelia's decision to rent the house for the summer. The big old house is a scary place, and Lizzie doesn't like the strange sounds, the strange caretaker [Spencer Charters], and the strange stories he tells about seeing ghosts in the house. Add to the fact that the Bat has taken to the country, and Lizzie is terrified of everything and anything. She's even gone so far as to set a bear trap outside her bedroom window, just in case the Bat decides to pay a vist. When Cornelia's niece Dale [Una Merkel], who works at the Oakdale Bank, returns home with her boyfriend Brook Bailey[William Bakewell] and tries to pass him off as a gardener, Cornelia is immediately suspicious (Cornelia: Any experience with alopecias? Brook: They dry up if you don't water them.), but Cornelia hires him anyway, at least until she can find out why Dale has brought him home. A rock suddenly comes crashing through the window. A note on it reads: Get out of the house now while there is still time. Immediately thereafter, Dr Venrees [Gustav von Seyffertitz] drops by to inform Cornelia that the Oakdale bank has been robbed of a half million dollars and that Fleming, Sr, the owner of the mansion, is returning from Europe so Cornelia will have to vacate the house. Then, a heavy painting moves, and a voice from behind warns them to get out of the house. Becoming concerned, Cornelia phones the police. When Detective Anderson [Chester Morris] shows up, Cornelia explains her suspicion that Fleming, Jr [Hugh Huntley] is trying to frighten her out of the house, possibly because he rented it to her while his father was out of the country. Nowthat his father is returning, she thinks he may be trying to frighten her into leaving. Soon everyone begins acting suspiciously. The doctor unlocks the broken window and \"forgets\" to relock it until Cornelia relocks it herself. Alone in the parlor for a few moments, Venrees unlocks the window again. Brook starts going around the house pounding on the walls. Dale phones Fleming Jr and asks him to come over. When he does, he brings a blueprint of the house so that they can locate a hidden room. Before they can find it, he is murdered, and Dale hides a piece torn from the blueprint under a tray. A storm is approaching, and the lightning knocks out the electricity. Someone phones from the garage, but when Det Anderson goes out to check, there is no one there. Detective Jones [Charles Dow Clark] arrives to help with the investigation. Dr Venrees finds the torn piece from the blueprint showing that the hidden room is behind a fireplace, but Det Anderson forces him to hand it over. When Anderson is poring over the blueprint, Venrees clobbers him with a heavy statue and locks his body in a closet. In the lightning flashes, the silhouette of the Bat can be seen peering into the window. It gets even more intriguing. Brook turns out to be a cashier from the bank and the primary suspect in the theft. Fleming Sr is seen walking on the roof when he's supposed to be out of the country. Dale finds the secret room behind a fireplace and gets locked in, along with the Bat, Mr Fleming Sr, and the money. The Bat shoots Fleming Sr. Dale escapes and leads Inspector Jones, Cornelia, and Dr Venrees to the secret room. Just as the fireplace swings open, Venrees blows out the candle, allowing whomever was in the room to escape. Finally, Inspector Anderson figures it out. Dr Venrees and Fleming Sr robbed the bank together and hid the money in the house. Anderson arrests Venrees and locks him in a closet. A strange man suddenly stumbles into the room. He's been hit in the head and is suffering from amnesia. He remembers only that he tried to phone from the garage. As they search the secret room for the money and find nothing, Cornelia thinks that she sees someone out on the roof and Anderson goes outside to catch him. Shortly thereafter, the garage is set afire. The amnesic man grabs a gun and orders everyone to be silent. The fire was set to get everyone out of the room, he explains, and the person who set that fire will be back shortly to get the money. They blow out the candles and wait. The Bat enters the house. The amnesic man points the gun at the Bat and orders Inspector Jones to disarm him. Just as they prepare to remove the black hood from the Bat's face, the Bat creates a distraction by knocking over a chair and escaping...right into the bear trap that Lizzie set so many hours ago. The Bat has been captured. They remove his hood to see that it's Detective Anderson. The amnesic explains that he is the real Detective Anderson, but he was clobbered in the garage by the Bat, who took his IDs. But the Bat isn't ready to be captured. While he extols his great intellect, he pulls out a gun he found on the ground and forces everyone to put up their hands. Only Cornelia refuses. I took the bullets out of that gun only ten minutes ago, she says. Everyone jumps on the Bat, and the gun goes off. Cornelia was lying! As the movie closes and the curtain falls on the stage, the Bat drops down from the ceiling. Chester Morris, who played Detective Anderson and the Bat, then addresses the audience. He asks them not to reveal the identity of the Bat to anyone and promises that, if they keep the secret, the Bat will not haunt their homes, steal their money, or frighten their children.

         "I avoided seeing The Bat Whispers for many years because I had seen a documentary called \"The Horror of it All\". In it they used clips and gave away the killer by showing us the ending!!! Not that it cannot be figured out by many. The great news is I thoroughly enjoyed the film (with many repeated viewings) anyway. It has become a Halloween tradition for me as I watch it once every year. The killer's identity is only part of the fun. My writing this post is due to a wonderful thunder storm we had that exactly matched the intensity and character of the storm in this film - Lightning with long pauses before thunder and NO RAIN. I have seen tons of old dark house mystery/horror/comedies from the 20s, 30s and 40s and I dare anyone to name better ones than this, Paul Leni's two mysteries, and Whale's The Old Dark House. Many of the ODH films of that time were poverty row. Some were downright boring, others interesting, but none with such a distinctive style as those mentioned. I cannot understand the harshness people can feel about this film. One has to put themselves in a mood to watch such a film. It was never intended to be incredibly meaningful like Ben- Hur, or All Quiet on the Western Front. This is pure pulp from start to end. The Bat Whispers, is in many ways, a forerunner to today's gigantic comic book movies. Some have much style (Batman, The Matrix, X-Men) and some are totally ridiculous with the same absurd plot holes (Batman, The Matrix, X-Men, etc.). So, what can one expect? A totally fun, old-fashioned mystery romp that satisfies one's need for shadows, lighting, special effects, atmosphere, mystery, horror and downright silliness. This is a masterpiece in the genre and also Roland West's greatest film. It is consistent with the films that West shot. It's a shame he didn't continue with his dark style of film-making. Chester Morris has been called a ham in these posts and that's true. And what terrific ham! He gives one of the best performances in an ODH movie. His intensity was perfectly enhanced by the powerful arc lamps that under lit him, so much so that he suffered scorched retinas and unfortunately suffered visually for the rest of his life. That is a man dedicated to the art of his film! Morris makes the proceeds far more interesting than any other 'detective' I have seen in this type of film. The supporting cast makes this effectively spooky (Gustav von Seyferritz as Ven Rees leads the way). Overall, this is stylish escapism at its' best in the old-fashioned sense. Special credit goes to the camera operators and art director. Both standard and widescreen versions are completely different takes and different films. I prefer the standard version, as Morris' close-ups are far more effective. The one when he returns and stands at the top of the stairs is avant-garde in how he is so perfectly centered and unnaturally under lit. I could go on.... a great fun film!",
         "Great fun! The special effects are amazing for a 1930 movie. Miniaturized sets are used & although they're primitive by today's standards, keep in mind that this movie is over 70 years old. It's an excellent Old Dark House movie, complete with thunderstorms, secret passageways, a mysterious creature named \"The Bat,\" comedic elements, a large old house, several murders, etc. It's been noted that the comic strip character, \"Batman,\" owes some of his origins to \"The Bat,\" & it's apparent in the outfit, the shadows cast from buildings, & in the name of the character itself. \"The Bat\" is indeed a pretty scary entity. The sound effects are good, camera work is excellent, & the ending is bizarre. It kept my interest throughout its 83 minutes. Well worth seeing for Old Dark House fans (this is one of the best). I rate it 9/10.",
         "Yes, this film is dated. The acting is beyond hammy; only in the early talkies did movies contain this kind of unabashedly theatrical performing. Just when you think Chester Morris couldn't possibly twist his mouth--or curl his eyebrow--or twirl his finger--in a new way, he surprises you and offers a wholly different mugging expression he hadn't pulled out before. Along with the acting, the genre (the creepy old house with hidden panels etc.) became old hat by 1950. So, all right, this movie is stilted and creaks. However, for a film antiquarian, this motion picture is a joy. Its sets and lighting are breathtaking, and one gathers from it why the play was one of the longest running on Broadway at the time. I'll take it over the Vincent Price remake, THE BAT, anyday and I love Vincent Price.",
         "Roland West first filmed the story of the Bat, a killer that steals money and jewels for their value as well as for adventure, in 1926. He then made The Bat Whispers in 1930, which is a sound version of his silent film. The transition is not entirely smooth yet rewarding. Let me first state that the silent film is easily the superior of the two. The silent film had a much more creepier feeling to it. The acting was far superior, and the sets were incredible. West does duplicate much of the sets and shots that were in his first version. The acting, however, is not very good as it is obvious that sound pictures have not been around too long. West tries to accommodate that new innovation which sometimes results in stagey scenes and long dialogue sessions. Chester Morris is...well, to say the least...a ham. His performance is a bit over-the-top for me. He does show glimmers of talent though. The story is pretty much the same and that is the film's strength. It's a fun mystery that by today's standards will seem crude and silly, but taken in context of its time should provide some entertainment. Oddly enough, the mystery seemed less mysterious in this version. I knew who the killer was with ease(trying to distance myself from the memory of the first film as I did this). West again has some impressive camera shots. The opening scene of the bat stealing a jewel from an apartment high in the sky was incredible as was the journey of the bat over a bank and following a man with a lot of money. The camera work of West is innovative, and it is a pity that his life was cut short and we did not get a chance to see him employ his talents in other projects.",
         "Roland West's THE BAT WHISPERS was based on a hugely successful Broadway play, The Bat, widely credited for having created the vogue for thriller plays in the 1920's. (The 1927 production \"Dracula\" which starred Bela Lugosi on stage was part of the mystery vogue, and led directly to the 1930 Universal film which kicked off the 30's cycle of horror movies). West filmed The Bat in 1926 as a silent, with great success. The 1930 remake was a large production, shot simultaneously in standard 35mm and a new widescreen 65mm process. Theater owners largely rejected the expense of installing 65mm equipment, and most people who saw this film on its release saw the 35mm version. Among them was Bob Kane, who credited it as a major influence in his creation of Batman in the late 30's. It's easy to see why. This is a stunning looking film (I'm referring to the 35mm version, which I saw at the 2004 UCLA Festival of Preservation) gorgeously photographed by Ray June. In an old dark house where the lights are constantly going off, and lighting is frequently provided by candles, or lightning, bizarre lighting effects start to become the norm, and the dramatic possibilities take off. The director used every conceivable angle to keep things visually lively, mirroring the ridiculous complexity of the plot with a visual complexity that always keeps the viewer slightly off balance. Much has been made of the sweeping camera moves and the use of miniatures. The miniatures are a bit obvious, but their intent remains effective if you're willing to go with it. (Being willing to \"go with it\" is pretty much a necessity in general for this film, which was a wild and unrealistic ride in its time, and deliberately so.) The photography benefits from a number of technical innovations, including a lightweight camera dolly invented for this production that allowed the camera to be moved 18 feet vertically in a matter of moments. The performances - both comic and dramatic characters - are deliberately hokey, very stagey turns that were the standard for this genre. Much of Chester Morris' mugging and squinting, however, are attributable to the violently bright underlighting that was used in his closeups, which eventually scorched his retinas (a condition which became known as Klieg Eye). Within that context, they are wonderful performances. Morris is particularly engaging, as is Grayce Hampton as the patrician Cornelia Van Gorder, the middle-aged spinster who refuses to be scared out of the house. (Hampton appears to be a very capable stage actress, and offers perhaps the most natural performance in the film. She had made one previous film \u0096 in 1916 \u0096 and made numerous subsequent ones, usually in bit parts, until she was nearly 80.) Her no-nonsense dowager centers the film perfectly, keeping the other characters (and performances) from plunging completely off the deep end. The plot? A master criminal, The Bat, is on the loose, a half-million dollars have been stolen from a bank by somebody else, and The Bat is trying to get it. The money has apparently been brought to a lonely mansion in a rural town (apparently somewhere on then-rural Long Island) where a middle-aged woman and her made are renting for the summer. Someone is trying to scare her out of the house, so she has sent for detectives. From there, anything goes.",
         "This is a great old black and white mystery/suspenser. If you have the capacity to enjoy films of the 30's and 40's and you like mysteries and fine film craftsmanship, see his movie. Chester Morris is very good as the lead. The plot is relatively true to the Hopwood/Rinehart original screenplay. The setting is an old mansion with a spinster and family members terrified by a super criminal known as the Bat. They get outside help, but the Bat strikes anyway. Who is the Bat? What does he want in the old mansion? The story answers those questions in a most old-fashioned, entertaining manner. Of the three movie versions of the Bat, the 1926 silent, the 1950's Vincent Price/Agnes Moorhead version, and this one, this is the best.",
         "A tour-de-force of chases, shootouts, and robbery, as \"The Bat\" terrorizes a city, and particularly the renters of a mansion where he makes his hideout. Nearly everybody is a suspect, but the key lighting pretty much gives it away. Nonetheless, West keeps the pace moving so fast that we don't really have time to stop and think about much of anything. Features West's trademark effects with miniatures and wires. Some remarkable photography (in 65mm, no less) in the disappearing silent gothic tradition makes this movie a link from the newly emerging horror scene to the old \"haunted house with criminals\" genre into which it more properly falls. \"Goofy gothic\" excellence.",
         "No doubt about it, the silent screen acting technique is still present in this early talkie. Everyone behaves as though they had a case of first night stage jitters--and the supposedly comic moments are painfully obvious and tainted with smokehouse ham. But aside from the theatrics of some of the cast, this is an entertaining and truly spooky old dark house kind of comedy-mystery that was so popular during the '30s and '40s. What is most amazing is the fluidity of the camerawork through the innovative use of miniatures and the camera's ability to zoom forward and slink along the exteriors of an old mansion like a prowling cat. It is worth seeing alone for the atmospheric sets and photography, especially considering that this was filmed in 1930 when sound itself was only two years old. Only Chester Morris among the performers delivers a really credible performance acceptable by today's standards of acting. The others are way over the top--including Una Merkel and just about all of the supporting players with the exception of William Bakewell. If you're a fan of Mary Roberts Rinehart stories, you'll enjoy this version of her successful play. It's far superior to the later remake with Vincent Price. Be sure to see this in the newly released Wide Screen Version. It's a pristine transfer from the restoration by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.",
         "Based on a play that was filmed four years earlier by the same director this is a wonderful film that is hampered only by the limitations of sound. That said this is probably the best version of the story. A fiend known as The Bat is lurking around the mansion of a rich family and its up to an intrepid detective to prevent him from getting the goods. This movie is a lot of fun, with several wonderful performances especially by Chester Morris as the detective. Interestingly the film was filmed both in the standard aspect ratio and in an early wide screen process (Both are on the DVD). The films are more or less identical, but since they were taken from different takes they both play like two different nights of the same play. I like this film a great deal and recommend it to anyone who likes the Old Dark House genre.",
         "The film does feel creaky, the humor is laid a little too thick for my tastes at times (much like Paul Leni's THE CAT AND THE CANARY [1927], in fact) and Maude Eburne as the cowardly maid IS unbearable\u0085but this is more than made up for, in my opinion, by the film's dazzling cinematography, atmospheric sets and deliberate theatricality (complete with asides to the audience in the finale). In any case, it's easily miles ahead of the inept and boring Vincent Price remake of 1959! You will have noticed that I have preceded (as is my fashion) the film's name with that of its director. I'll be the first to admit that nearly nobody today remembers Roland West, let alone be prepared to accord him \"auteur\" status, but you'll agree that the VERY distinctive visual style of the film indicates an assured guiding hand behind the whole project. Although hardly as well-known today or as easy to find, THE BAT WHISPERS is by no means West's only notable feature; as a matter of fact, based on the minute information I've managed to find on them in my reference books, I'd be very interested in watching THE UNKNOWN PURPLE (1923; an intriguing-sounding precursor to James Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN [1933]), THE BAT (1926; the original Silent-film version of THE BAT WHISPERS), the gangster drama ALIBI (1929; which even earned Chester Morris a Best Actor Academy Award nomination) and CORSAIR (1931), his last film. As for myself, the only other Roland West film I've seen is the atypical and rather unsatisfactory Lon Chaney vehicle THE MONSTER (1925), which also happens to be a bizarre 'old dark house' melodrama. Elliott Stein, in Richard Roud's indispensable tome, \"Cinema: A Critical Dictionary \u0096 The Major Film-Makers\" described Roland West as \"one of America's supremely original visual stylists, the director of a series of stunning thrillers.\" He also names ALIBI \"one of the most oppressive films ever made\u0085the distorted sets, odd angles and restless camera make it West's most Germanic work\u0085this claustrophobic little nightmare would be fully at home in a retrospective of the American avant-garde film.\" Furthermore, he acclaims THE BAT WHISPERS as \"a pictorial knock-out\" and CORSAIR \"a visual treat\"! Unfortunately, his promising career was suddenly curtailed by a real-life tragedy. West was involved and living with renowned comedienne Thelma Todd (a frequent foil for Laurel & Hardy and The Marx Brothers) in Malibu at the time of her mysterious death in 1935. Neighbors heard them quarreling the night before the morning she was found in her garage overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning; though a suspect, he was never arrested but, of course, he could never work in Hollywood (or elsewhere) again. I've only watched THE BAT WHISPERS (twice), in Widescreen, on VHS and I've been meaning to pick up Image's DVD edition (comprising also the 'alternate' full-frame version, shot simultaneously by a different cameraman!) for the longest time. As it happens, from the online reviews I've read of the disc, the verdict as to which version is actually 'better' seems to be pretty mixed."
