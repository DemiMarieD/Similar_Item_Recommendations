         "Unless you are an extremely devoted fan of character actors Michael Lerner, Bud Cort, or Ed Lauter, I recommend skipping \"Girl in the Cadillac\". Erika Eleniak and William McNamara are on the run with $75,000 loot from a bank robbery. Their partners in crime, Lerner and Cort are in hot pursuit. Unfortunately that razor thin, well worn plot, cannot sustain momentum. The dialog is sappy, the acting mediocre, and the ending totally unbelievable. I mean three police officers are shot, Eleniak gives the money back, and lives happily ever after? Ed Lauter played the only sympathetic character, in this too cute for it's own good failed film. - MERK",
         "I bought a video tape of this movie because of Erika Eleniak. She bears a striking resemblance with French acting legend Simone Signoret, but unfortunately does not share her talents. However, in this movie I have seen Eleniak's best performance by far, and she shows unexpected potential. Based on a story by James B. Cain, the movie has a distant feel of Film Noir. But it is a light, rather harmless affair. The actors are overall clean and kind and shiny, any kind of depravity or sorrow is sort of glossed over. It is actually quite pleasant to watch. The director apparently mainly makes documentaries, this influences the style of this movie favorably. The locations are well chosen and well filmed. Experienced actors like Valerie Perrine, Michael Lehrer and Bud Cort give good support to the young couple, played by Eleniak and William McNamara. The chemistry between the characters is quite good, especially between the young lovers who are quite believable in their parts. So, it's good entertainment and not a waste of time.",
         "My favorite Erika Eleniak movie. Better than Chasers and Under Siege. McNamara is much better in this than he was in Chasers, where he played a Tom Cruise wannabe. In this these to are a couple, who've just met, on the lam. End up getting in big trouble but in the end everything is okay. Simple story but I just love Erika to death. 6/10"
