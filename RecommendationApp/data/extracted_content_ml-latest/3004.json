         "Why, oh, why do they try and remake Buster Keaton's movies, he was such a master of his craft that it is near impossible to make anything near as good as his original movies. Saying that, even if I hadn't seen 'Seven Chances' before seeing this I'd still have the same opinion, Chris O'Donnell had the potential to be a star, but, he has the inability to know a good script and this is a classic example. None of the characters are particularly endearing, Arte Lange is plain annoying and seeing Ed Asner and Hal Holbrooke was saddening. Rene Zellwegger is as usual very good, which is about the only positive thing in this sorry excuse of a movie. Major plothole, how come all the brides turn up at the church in full, perfectly fitting bridal regalia on only a few hours notice? Are we supposed to believe that all women have a perfect wedding outfit in their wardrobe 'just in case'? And amazingly, the wedding dress found for Anne fits like a dream, an amazing coincidence or what!! At least in Keaton's version the 'brides' are in their normal clothing with just cobbled together veils to distinguish them as brides, far more convincing. My advice, hunt down a copy of the original 'Seven Chances', there is no comparison. Note to reviewer Matt Doolittle, BusterKeaton was an amazing man, but, even he couldn't direct a film 33 years after his death.",
         "SPOILERS THROUGH: The Bachelor is a sweet, rather dull romantic comedy starring Rennee Zelweger and Chris O'Donnell. It's a movie that almost seems to promise hilarity yet strangely the movie isn't that funny. In fact it's not that interesting either though certainly not unwatchable. Yet for some reason, even though this movie contains two warm likable charismatic leads, the movie never picks up steam. I think there were a few things that I did not like here, one being the playing out of a very funny premise. But the movie, even though it's not that long, gets rather irritating. The whole thing centers on O'Donnell proposing to various women and while it was fun at first, none of the women are in their scenes long enough to make a strong comedic impression and Zelwegger herself, while coming across as charming and sweet as always, is somewhat underused. Her main point seems to be moaning about her problems with Jimmy. In the meantime, the viewer can't make up their mind whether Jimmy is a nice guy or a jerk, mainly because he keeps switching back and forth and we never get to see him one aspect of his personality for to long. The movie becomes a bit tedious as well as Jimmy races around in search of new ex girlfriends to propose to so he can get his inheritance. It should be laugh out loud funny but isn't. I was moderately interested in how it turned out but also wanted it to end. It was a given that these two would wind up together anyway. The movie didn't seem to contain enough truly hilarious material and with a premise such as this, it should have, because this is a great situation on which to build a romantic comedy. I thought there would be unforgettable one liners and I'd be falling out of my seat....did not happen at all. However with this cast, particularly Zelwegger I'd never call it bad, just strongly lacking in some areas, particularly the comedic. And then we come to the famous scene with the hundreds(or thousands?) of Brides chasing Jimmy. Now if any scene had the potential to be UTTERLY HILARIOUS it was that one. But it doesn't happen. The brides aren't funny, their annoying, and by that time one just wants them to stop chasing the groom so he can marry Renee Zelwegger and the movie can end. It's another scene that should be hysterical but just fell flat. In closing, this is watchable but a bit disappointing and not very funny though the end is very romantic and big fans of Zelwegger may want to check it out, that was my main reason for doing so. My rating is 5 of 10.",
         "If you are looking for a non intellectually stimulating romantic comedy, and this is on TV and you aren√ït really going to pay attention, and your main alternative to watching is staring at the wall, then you are in luck. The Bachelor is the sort of movie that seems about eight years old as soon as it comes out on TV. The special effects involving various men running with horses look about this old. Basically the film revolves around the idea of bachelors as stallions powerful wild and free, the idea of true love, and functions as a frame work for √ícute√ì romantic cliches about true love and what not. Basically the best part that lasts more than thirty seconds is the proposal with Buckley. This is not worth watching the movie for. The only non paid for reference (read non advertisement) to this movie that I have seen is something about Mariah Carey: from singing to acting, but this is the sort of √íacting√ì that a fan would not want spread around. Oh well so much for long term artistic merit or historical value of any kind. What interests me most about this movie is what bystanders thought when they saw the scenes with hundreds of wedding dress clad bride hopefuls storming the streets, running up and down the same hill over and over again until they got the perfect take, and generally walking around the city. The wedding dress scenes are very impressive and alone are almost worth watching the movie previews for. It is kind of sad that some sort of candid camera clip of bystanders staring at a bunch of actresses in wedding gowns would probably be more exciting than the movie, but that√ïs the way it is with The Bachelor. I didn√ït think that this movie was worth my time, but some people just love happy little romantic comedies. I realize that I am not in this group, and consider this to be the worst movie that I have paid to see this year. Try as I might I will never get back my 5 dollars and the 90 minutes of my life spent on this movie. If you do watch this do something else, preferably something distracting, at the same time. Given any alternative don√ït watch this.",
         "SOME MINOR SPOILERS (REGARDING THE PLOT - NOT WHAT HAPPENS)! \"The Bachelor\" Chris O'Donnell stars with Renee Zellweger in the 1999 remake `The Bachelor,' a film about `the true meaning of love.' Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) is your average 29-year-old bachelor: he doesn't want to let the good times come to a stop. But after he is pushed by friends to propose to his girlfriend Anne (Zellweger), he does so, and accidentally says some regrettable things in the proposal line (`You win!'). After a fuming Anne refuses to respond to any of Jimmie's calls in the days to come, Jimmie comes to a realization that the relationship is over. And then it happens. His grandfather passes away, leaving 100 million dollars to Jimmie. What's the catch, you ask? He must find a wife in twenty-seven hours to get the money. And so, the game is on, as Jimmie proposes to all his old girlfriends, including Ilana (Mariah Carey), Daphne (Jennifer Esposito), Buckley (Brooke Shields), but before all them, a re-proposal to an ever-softened Anne, who realizes before saying `Yes' that Jimmie is not ready to get married. `The Bachelor' is a remake of `Personal,' `How a French Nobleman Got a Wife Through the 'New York Herald' Personal Columns,' `Meet Me at the Fountain,' and `Seven Chances,' all of which I have not seen. Therefore, I have nothing to base my review on. Also, therefore, I enjoyed this film. It may be a bit odd at times, especially the end, but overall it is just fun. It is a good escapism film where one can sit back, relax, and forget their worries. Chris O'Donnell may not be a great actor, but he pulled off Jimmie Shannon enough to not raise any eyebrows. I found Renee Zellweger to be quite good as Anne, providing a typical `woman moment,' when she, after Jimmie makes an awful proposal to her, grabs some food and hogs down. James Cromwell is best as `The Priest,' who Jimmie carries around all day to perform a marriage on the spot. I love the deadpan expressions Cromwell carries throughout the whole film, until the end, where he finally speaks to Jimmie about love. `The Bachelor' may not have the greatest character development, and the end was a bit more than odd (too much so to call it `original'); but I still enjoyed the film. At its heart lies a refreshingly fun comedy with a disclaimer: `Please detach brains before viewing.') Dumb fun. Nothing less, nothing more. 3/5 stars \u0096 John Ulmer",
         "The sight of an army of brides in white chasing a man down the streets is a very unusual and funny one. It was especially funny the first time around, with Buster Keaton. In \"Seven Chances\" (1925) old stone face played a man who had been left an inheritance of a large sum of money ($7 million)under the condition that he get married before his next birthday...which happens to be the following day. His efforts to find a willing bride results in ridicule, a car wreck, etc. He finally puts an ad in the paper, telling the circumstances, and asking for the applying bride to meet him at the church. At least a thousand women ranging from fat, small, young, old, beautiful, downright misshapen arrive at the church. Well, the same exact thing happens in this movie \"The Bachelor\" (though inflation has turned $7 Million into $100 million), only I gotta say the Keaton version is still the original and unsurpassed (and unsurpassable) masterpiece. I actually couldn't believe they named it \"The Bachelor\", it's a very boring title.",
         "In order to protect a $100 million inheritance, commitment-shy bachelor Chris O'Donnell (as Jimmie Shannon) learns he must marry before he reaches his impending 30th birthday. Naturally, Mr. O'Donnell proposes to the woman he loves, beautiful blonde Ren√©e Zellweger (as Anne Arden). But, Ms. Zellweger senses O'Donnell's heart really isn't in his \"(empty your intestine) or get off the pot!\" proposal. Zellweger bails, with sister Marley Shelton (as Natalie). So, O'Donnell, with pal Artie Lange (as Marco) assisting, tries to locate a marriage-minded woman, who is willing to share $100 million, and produce a baby. Any takers? Ms. Shelton is a sweet sidekick, and Brooke Shields (as Buckley) stands out among the unfortunately wasted supporting cast. Gary Sinyor's \"The Bachelor\" is a lesser re-make of a well-remembered Buster Keaton comedy (\"Seven Chances\"). No cigar and not even close. **** The Bachelor (1999) Gary Sinyor ~ Chris O'Donnell, Renee Zellweger, Marley Shelton",
         "\"The Bachelor\" is a pretty good light romantic comedy. Brook Shields does indeed have the best scene in the whole flick. It's well described below, and is wonderfully funny. Rene Zellweger is both very good and very charming, as is Chris O'Donnell. It's not the sort of movie that will stay with you for much, but its pretty good fun while it's going on. There's one thing I have to say though, and the main reason I'm bothering with a comment to this flick. Those that claim this movie is unrealistic and misogynist because of it's depiction of O'Donnell's former girlfriends and the huge number of women desperate for 100 million dollars, are infected with a serious case of delusional feminist PC propaganda. I can guarantee you that if an ad (turned into a front page article) with a picture guaranteeing sharing in a $100 million fortune for marrying a guy who looks like Chris O'Donnell the next day in a big American city (and clarifying that he was deadline desperate due to the date of his grandfather's death and the will provisions, so that many would feel they had a chance and he wasn't necessarily an impossible loser), there would indeed be hordes of women lining up to do it. Many wouldn't of course. But there'd be legions willing to take their chances. One of the main things limiting the numbers in fact would be self selection. The clich√© that women (especially after their early 20's) tend to be attracted to money (or its prospect), fame and or success, while men tend to be attracted to beauty, has more than a little truth to it. Of course there also has to be personal chemistry in the ordinary course, but with $100 million on the table, a great many women would take their chances. So the crowd scenes are indeed plausible (if so many managing the wedding dresses on a few hours notice isn't). What's most unrealistic is the PC \"balancing\" rejection this centi-millionaire gets from all but one of his former girl friends. That of course is what takes up the bulk of the movie. That is what is impossible to believe in the real world. In other words, \"The Bachelor\" actually leans over backwards to pretend that a far higher proportion of women wouldn't be swayed by the $100 million than is realistic. But just imagine how a more accurate balance would be criticized by the American media (not to mention academic) pundits of the moment. There are endless dismissive allusions to men being unduly or primarily interested in women's looks in today's American films -- and that that is terrible. (Why -- well, because women tend to have different priorities, and women must be right not only for themselves, but for men as well, of course.). That sort of commentary (with some basis in truth, if not in how it is characterized), often clearly intended as a put down of males, is perfectly fine under the reigning Hollywood ideology. Whereas highlighting women's special attraction (often enough) to men with power of various sorts -- money, fame, politics or sometimes physical power -- is dangerous ground indeed. Gee, I wonder why that is.",
         "Chris O'Donnell has a certain appeal. For me, it's his facial expressions. He is the master at portraying reactions by a mild mannered \"everyman\" overwhelmed by immediate circumstances. Rene Zellwegger was a mildly cute Texas girl-next-door several years before this one. In this one, set in San Francisco, her Texas accent and tomboyish outrage is not appealing.But she is supposed to be a fed-up girlfriend, so I guess she does it well. I envied the main character. How great would it be to look like him, have a guaranteed easy job for life at a pool table manufacturer in San Francisco, owned by his own family, and then inherit a bunch of money? I've met guys like that, who cruise along in \"auto-pilot\" with their looks, casual demeanor, and money. The sidekick character played by Artie Lang was so over-the-top obnoxious! I couldn't take it. That's his real life personality, so he wasn't acting. It was also excruciating to see classic actors like Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook play old fools in a romantic comedy for young people. It seemed degrading. I loved the imagery of single men being lassoed by a cowboy rope as symbolic of being trapped by the need to marry. I also thought the famous thousand brides scene was well done. I particularly liked the initial part of it at the church, when Chris is answering their questions about his preferences. Brooke Shields looks old and hard. Don't expect much, although she played her role well. I thought there was just the right amount of character development. You don't want too much in a RomCom. If you can stand Artie Lang,give this picture a viewing on a rainy day.",
         "Jimmy Shannon has a big problem. What is he to do with an inheritance of a hundred millions left to him by his grandfather if he doesn't marry by a set date? Having said the wrong things to the one woman he truly loves, has resulted in sending Anne Arden away; she wants nothing to do with him. Unknown to Anne, Jimmy is now a rich man. Will she come back to him, or will Jimmy marry someone else that will assure him of the millions he inherited? When it comes to dumb situations made by Hollywood, nothing is too much. This formula film, directed by Gary Sinyor, doesn't go anywhere. It tries to be too cute for its own good. It also has a gimmick going for itself when hundreds of women dressed in wedding gowns come to claim Jimmy for themselves. The problem is with the pairing of a bland Chris O'Donnell, with another bland actress, Renee Zellwegger, who is the epitome of \"cuteness\" in the movies. If the viewer accepts these two can even attract one another, then there is nothing wrong in the world. Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook, two good actors are seen in the film, but they have nothing to play with. Steve Cohen's screenplay doesn't do justice to the original material created originally for Buster Keaton, a genius in his own right, who should probably he horrified by this take on \"Seven Chances\".",
         "Maybe it was just the theater, or maybe the projector person didn't know what he was doing, but in 75 percent of the scenes the boom mike was just hanging there above people's heads! In the scene on the pond, it looked like the priest was being attacked by a furry bird, and you could see where the actors were going to walk next because the mike was leading the way. It was so bad it was hilarious. Which is good because there wasn't that much else that was funny in this movie. Renee Zellweger shone far above the rest of the cast, Chris O'Donnell still needs to work on his comic timing, and the entire plot was an insult to women. Oh sure, everyone has a wedding dress just sitting around, just in case some stranger wants to marry you with little notice. Overall, a horrible experience. My girlfriend and I fought for the rest of the day."
