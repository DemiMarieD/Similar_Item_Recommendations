         "Who ever said Roger Corman is a no-good director, only capable of shooting sleazy quickies??? All the amateur-critics who live by this statement should urgently watch `The Masque of the Red Death' and reconsider. True, Corman depended on a magnificent and professional crew here.but it remains his achieving mostly. First and foremost, the most thrilling Edgar Allen Poe short story sets the right tone. Out of his entirely brilliant oeuvre, this fable is probably the most horrifying one. The over-talented Charles Beaumont adapted this into a compelling and intense script and the wholesome is wonderfully cinematographed by Nicolas Roeg. The same Roeg who went on making cool movies himself like `Don't Look Now' or `Track 29' to only name a few.Last but certainly not least, the legendary Vincent Price gives away one of the most stunning performances in his rich career. The Masque of the Red Death is the greatest and most ambitious film in Corman's Poe cycle and therefore it should get all the credit and praising it can possibly get. The atmosphere this film breathes is the most horrifying one I ever witnessed and the fable's theme is pure terror! Vincent Price is the absolute top as the wealthy servant of Satan who thinks his safely locked away in his castle while the plague of the Red Death crosses through the countryside.killing all the poor villagers. Inside the walls of his ghoulish castle (with the scariest cellars you'll ever see), Price entertains a group of rich and spoiled bastards by thinking up diabolical games and throwing eccentric parties. He's convinced that Satan protects him and that the plague of the Red Death can't do any harm. `The Masque of Red Death' does something here that is practically unique! There where all other horror movies can't fulfill in telling a satanic tale without showing a huge amount of bloodshed, Corman's film achieves this effect easily thanks to its atmosphere, its intelligent structure and side plots, the costumes and scenery and the beautiful use of colors. There's a genius scene in which a possessed Hazel Court walks from chamber to chamber.each of them shown in a different color. In short.The Masque of Red Death belongs to the absolute top of horror cinema ever! One of the most fascinating films of the sixties and the ideal proof that horror will never see highlights like this anymore.",
         "Roger Corman has done an outstanding job with this film, possibly the best of his Poe adaptations. Although the film really is an incorporation of two Poe stories....The Masque of the Red Death and Hop-Frog...it is an excellent, atmospheric, quality piece of entertainment. At the core of the film's strength are the performance of Price as the evil, malignant, malicious Prince Prospero, follower of the devil and cruel sovereign of an area plagued with a all-consuming Red Death, and the fabulous period sets and costumes, many borrowed from the film Beckett. Price is at his best, and his turn as Prospero easily ranks as his most sinister and wicked performance(closely running against his portrayal of a witch hunter in The Conquerer Worm). Vincent Price blends outrageous showmanship with intricate subtleties of a man reasoning why he is what he is. The dialogue certainly is more important than the action in the story...a reason why some viewers(younger ones more than likely) will find film a bit tiresome. The sets and costumes are just gorgeous and the film looks like the most lavish ever made by Corman and company. A true modern masterpiece of the horror cinema!",
         "Roger Corman frequently gets a hard time from misguided movie snobs who look down on b-grade and exploitation movies. While Corman undoubtedly was involved in more than his fair share of silly schlock (usually as a producer rather than a director), he also made some wonderful movies that are criminally underrated. Some of his best movies as a director were the series of Edgar Allen Poe adaptations he made in the Sixties starring horror legend Vincent Price. 'The Masque Of The Red Death' is quite possibly the very best in the series. It is certainly the most unusual and imaginative. Now I'm not sure whether it was filmed in Britain or not, but Price is supported by a largely British cast which includes Jane Asher ('The Stone Tape'), Hazel Court (Hammer's 'Curse Of Frankenstein'), and the legendary character actor Patrick Magee ('Dementia 13', 'A Clockwork Orange'). That and the fact that the cinematographer is none other than Nic Roeg(!), later to become famous for such classics as 'Performance', 'Don't Look Now' and 'The Man Who Fell To Earth', leads me to believe that it was made in England. The involvement of the aforementioned, and a strong script co-written by the talented Charles Beaumont (try and track down some of his short stories, you'll be impressed), make this a memorable experience. But Corman's direction should be given credit, and the single best thing about it is Vincent Price himself, who gives one of his very best performances. This movie has it all, striking visuals, an intriguing plot (with a stronger Satanic theme than generally seen in most mainstream horror movies), good acting, suspense, plenty of atmosphere, and some striking dream-like imagery many have compared to Bergman's 'Seventh Seal'. 'The Masque Of The Red Death' is one of Roger Corman's greatest achievements and one of the very best horror movies made in the 1960s. It has lost very little of its impact over the years and is still essential viewing for any horror fan, or anybody who appreciates imaginative cinema.",
         "Possibly the best of the Roger Corman-Vincent Price series of film adaptations of the stories of Edgar Allen Poe, 'The Masque of the Red Death' is a chilling and malevolent tale of decadent devil-worshippers holed up in a castle while the Red Death claims its victims in the village outside. Vincent Price was a gloriously hammy actor who played horror roles with the utmost seriousness. His characterization of Prince Prospero in this movie is brilliant - a man without a soul or heart who is only conquered when a girl of equal faith enters his castle (the wooden Jane Asher as Francesca). In support Hazel Court as the would-be Bride of Satan Juliana, and Patrick Magee as the corrupt Alfredo are particularly worthy of note. The dwarf's revenge on Alfredo during the masque is as chilling as anything which came before in films such as 1932's 'Freaks'; while the film shimmers with beautiful cinematography (especially the coloured rooms) and simmers with corruption. The combined effect is superb and makes the film a memorable experience.",
         "Baseball writers like to say that while fans pay to see home runs, it's actually pitching that wins ball games. The great teams are always strong up the middle, whether a power hitter is in the line-up or not. Vincent Price was the Babe Ruth of horror. Always at his chilling best, he gave hundreds of brilliant performances, but made only a handful of good movies. Why? He always hit home runs, yet most of the time he had to be the whole show. Evil was alive in his movies but good was either shadowy or non-existent. THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH is a masterpiece because for once Vincent is up against goodness that is rich, alluring, attractive and unique. Jane Asher gives an indelible performance as Francesca, the village girl who refuses to be cowed or corrupted by the suave, satanic lord. Though so waif-like and fragile that she could almost be a child, the beautiful redhead has the courage of her convictions and the real dignity of innocence. Watch the early scene where she is roughly undressed by handmaidens and forced into a hot bath in order to become more ladylike. Evil Count Prospero comes in to leer at her, of course, and she confronts him. While the steamy sensuality is certainly there, the astonishing thing is the dignity with which Francesca conducts herself. Once the evil lord is gone, she rises from her bath (discreetly wrapped in a towel) and announces to Prospero's jaded mistress Juliana, \"I will do what I must to save my men. But if they die, I will die -- and so will Prince Prospero.\" For once Vincent Price has something to work against, and the result is the richest, most colorful and rewarding film of his career. In the story line Jane strikes out Vincent, as Prospero is ultimately defeated -- but for once the slugger is playing on a World Series team.",
         "For this entry in his Poe series, Roger Corman decided to move the production to England. Not for artistic reasons, just because films made in England at that time got a government subsidy, and thus keeping his costs down. That's what I love about Corman - he brings a whole new meaning to the term 'penny pinching', and on the whole he has proved to cinema audiences the world over that great films don't need massive budgets and can excel on a shoestring. The Masque of the Red Death is another triumph over low budget, and sees horror's premier team of Vincent Price, Roger Corman and, of course, Edgar Allen Poe team up to great effect once again. This Poe story follows the evil Prince Prospero, a man who believes that his master, the Lord of Flies (Satan to you and me), will grant him and his friends that are taking refuge in his castle safety from the disease known as the 'red death' that is laying waste to the surrounding towns and villages. This is a very different production to the earlier films in Corman's Poe cycle. The sets are much more lavish and on the whole, it's on a much larger scale. This also marks something of a departure for the Poe protagonist. As usual, he's portrayed by Vincent Price (the finest horror actor to ever live) but unlike the parts he'd played for Corman so far, this character is a strong and malicious presence, and therefore a far cry from the more pathetic characters he played films like 'The Fall of the House of Usher' and 'The Pit and the Pendulum'. As usual, however, Price approaches this role with relish and completely makes it his own. His malicious tone fits the Prince Prospero character like a glove, and you cannot imagine anyone but Price in the role. The character is a typical Poe labyrinth and helps to maintain the interest and malicious intent that the film presents for it's running time. The story is one of absolute terror, and through Corman's surreal use of colours and atmosphere, he makes the best of it and the result is a truly terrifying tale of faith, disease and death. There are many macabre events in the film, but none of them go over the top with gore, nor are they especially sleazy. The film is consistent throughout, and it's obvious that everyone involved knew exactly what they wanted to achieve with it. The story revolves around having faith, whether it be faith in God or indeed in the Devil. The Masque of the Red Death professes that every man creates his own hell, and the way that is presented on screen is magnificent, just like the rest of this great film.",
         "For those of you who are fans of director Roger Corman's classic 50s sci-fi films like ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS, IT CONQUERED THE WORLD, or THE WASP WOMAN, you are going to be surprised that this is the same man who directed MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH. Superbly directed and beautifully composed, MASQUE is the first and best of Corman's Poe films of the 1960's. Prince Prospero (played with just enough venom by Vincent Price) is an evil tyrant who hates his citizens and thinks nothing of burning their village to the ground. Holding a weekend get-together for his noble acquaintances, he discovers that the Red Death has manifested itself in the village around his castle. He kidnaps the beautiful Francesca (the wonderful Jane Asher), her lover Gino, and her father and keeps them in the castle with him. Prospero is a Satan worshipper as well and forces the princess, Juliana, to brand herself with an upside-down cross and sics his falcon on her when he feels like it. All the while, the Red Death decimates the land outside the castle and eventually makes its grand entrance during a masque. Corman has certainly matured over the years. His filmmaking techniques are no longer shoestring or cheap. Here, it is obvious that he has developed a taste for color, atmosphere, tone, and lighting. MASQUE features his best work as a director and is only rivalled, in my opinion, by TALES OF TERROR, a later Poe anthology. Vincent Price proves once again why he has won the hearts of genre fans everywhere. I can only compare his performance here to that in HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, only better. Jane Asher does a splendid job here, but Hazel Court, Hammer's resident scream queen, has little to do here as Juliana. The final images of the film set during the masque are breathtaking and will stun those expecting cheap gothic thrills a la THE UNDEAD, an earlier Corman work. MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH is very deserving of a new VHS/DVD release. Fans of Price or Corman should definitely seek this out, as it is probably both mens' greatest work. Highly recommended.",
         "A reviewer linked to this site described \"The Masque of the Red Death\" as Bergmanesque. A Roger Corman film Bergmanesque? Since I've only seen one Ingmar Bergman film, and it bored me silly, this was not much of an endorsement. When I was a kid and Corman's Edgar Alan Poe adaptations were new, they scared the be-jeebers out of me. So would have \"The Masque of the Red Death\". After watching the movie recently, I didn't gain any insight into Mr. Bergman's film style, but I was entertained. And happily, the movie is free of the campy acting that seeps into so many of the Corman opus. Especially good is Vincent Price as the Satan-worshipping Prince Prospero, in whose castle his debauched guests wait out the plague that is ravishing the countryside. Dark and grotesque, this is an excellent example of Corman's work. Actually, one of the best I've seen.",
         "This is one of those movies whose reputation and stature has grown over the years, and deservedly so. From the wonderful sets and costumes that are awash in color, to the eerie and bombastic score, all the way through to the Bergman-inspired ending, this film is a classic. But towering over the direction by Corman, the set design by Haller, and the cinematography by Roeg is the performance of Vincent Price as Prospero. Here is a man who has seen the pain and evil in the world, who is a humanist in the sense that he believes that we must all be true to our natures and because of this he cannot accept that the world is ruled by a benevolent God. His friend and companion Alfredo, played by Patrick Magee, agrees with him but there are still subtle differences between them. Prospero has turned, not to what he considers evil, but to what he considers truth and understanding because he just can't believe that God would allow so much pain and misery in a world that He made - therefore, God is dead and the world is ruled by Satan. Alfredo, on the other hand, is a cruel and sadistic sycophant who is constantly on the lookout for more 'entertainment', whether thru torture or sex...or both. The inclusion of the story of Hop-Toad and the dancer is a masterstroke in that it lengthens and deepens the movie while also providing a highly deserving comeuppance to Alfredo. Jane Asher as the peasant girl, Francesca, starts by despising Prospero as a tyrant but in the ending ballroom sequence she feels pity for him, and you know that Prospero has achieved his aim with her: she is no longer innocent. See how much meaning you can wring out of a low-budget horror movie? As for the transfer, excellent with vivid colors and a strong Dolby Digital mono soundtrack. The only drawback, and it's a minor one, is that there's no commentary track from Corman - that would have been a delight. Still, this is probably one of the top ten best American horror movies ever made.",
         "One of my favorite horror movies of all time -- and one of Roger Corman's best films, if not his best. The plot adaption from the original Poe story is fantastic, expanding on the plot to make it into a full length film without taking it out of the bounds of Poe's vision. The cast is great too. Price adds a sadistic, morbid class to the film, perfectly believable as the devil-worshipping Prospero. It reminded me of the days when he used to appear in history/literature films, like Elizabeth and Essex or the Three Musketeers. Jane Asher is great as the distressed peasant with a good heart, slowly being corroded by Prospero. The wardrobe is another plus -- the ballroom outfits and masquerade attire does have one glaring mistake, but is fitting overall. The final scene is absolutely great film-making. The low budget of the film doesn't impede a true romantically creepy climax. Unique and done very well."
