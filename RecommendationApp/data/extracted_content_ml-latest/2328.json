Without the heavy weight of expectation for a return to form for John Carpenter, it proves to be a schlocky and bloody good time.\r\n\r\nJames Woods stars as a Vatican backed vampire slayer, something he does with considerable relish. But now he is up against an uber vampire in Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), a leader with powers unbound. Daniel Baldwin and Sheryl Lee are along for the gore laden ride.\r\n\r\nWoods is cool, with a quip on the tongue and a deadly weapon to hand, his by-play with Tim Guinee's priest provides much of the film's humour. The photography, choreography, editing and tension building are all high in quality, and while the story is weak and there's a whiff of misogyny in the mix, for a horror popcorner there's a good time to be had here. 7/10",

      "synopsis": "Jack Crow (James Woods) is a professional and Vatican-funded vampire slayer. He and his team of slayers have just rooted out a nest of nine vampires in the New Mexico desert but, disappointingly, the master vampire--Jan Valek--was not there. Still, the team is partying at the Sun God Motel, rejoicing in their victory. Unbeknown to the slayers, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) is in the adjoining room, seducing and biting Katrina (Sheryl Lee), a hooker hired for the party. Before Jack is even aware of Valek's presence, Valek has viciously slain his entire team as well as all the hookers. During the battle, Valek says Jack's name, which takes the slayer by surprise. Only Jack, Katrina, and Jack's partner Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) manage to escape. After beheading and burning the bodies of his team (to make sure they don't turn into vampires), Jack goes directly to Cardinal Alba (Maximilian Schell) for further instructions. Alba has more bad news. Their European team was also wiped out three days ago near Cologne, Germany, and a portrait of Jan Valek was found there. According to archivist, Father Adam Guiteau (Tim Guinee), Valek was a 14th century priest who turned against the church and was burned at the stake for heresy. After his death, however, Valek became a vampire, the first of his kind. The Vatican wants Jack to rebuild his team, and they give him Guiteau as his first replacement. Jack wants nothing to do with the milquetoast bookworm, especially because he suspects the team's slaying was a setup, and it could just as easily have been Guiteau as anyone else in the church. After physically abusing Guiteau a few times, Jack levels with him. He shows him a map of where nests of vampires have been killed in the Southwest since the 1800s. It shows a pattern of an ever-widening circle, and Jack thinks that they're searching for something. Furthermore, he thinks they might be searching for a black cross that he heard of when he was young. Meanwhile, Montoya and Katrina are holed up in a hotel. Katrina hasn't turned yet and, when she finds out that she's been bitten by a vampire. Montoya wants to keep her around because of her telepathic link to Valek. She tries to commit suicide by jumping off a ledge but Montoya manages to pull her back through the window, but he cuts his arm while doing so, and Katrina grabs it and starts sucking. Montoya knocks her out and then burns the bite with a lighter, hoping to sterilize it from the sickness that will convert him. When Katrina awakens, she starts having visions. The first one is of Valek in a church in San Miguel County. The next vision shows Valek looking at a map and then killing a priest. Guiteau offers to get a list of all the churches in the county, a clue that leads them to Father Molina, whose body was found decapitated and laying alongside a dirt road. After further brutal interrogation by Jack, Guiteau finally confesses that Molina was the only one in the world who knew the whereabouts of the black Bersier cross, an ancient relic that was used in the exorcism meant to drive the demons from Valek's body. Unfortunately, the exorcism resulted in turning him into a vampire was never completed, leaving Valek vulnerable to the sun. He needs the cross now to finish the ritual. If he succeeds, he will be able to live in the daytime. A master vampire able to walk in the sun would be unstoppable. It's sundown and Valek with a new group of vampires are rising from the ground where they sleep. Through her telepathic connection to Valek, Katrina can tell that he is accompanied by seven other master vampires. She can see them headed into a small Spanish mission. She can see the vampires brutally slaying the mission clerics. And she can see Valek taking down the black cross. \"He's got it!\" she smiles. The next day Katrina leads Jack and Montoya to the small, deserted town of Santiago where she says Valek is hiding in the best-contructed building in town -- the jailhouse. With only three slayers and as many as 30 vampires, Jack, Montoya, and Guiteau have their work cut out for them. As the day wears on, Guiteau lures out the vampires, Jack shoots stakes into their chests from his crossbow, and Montoya drives the winch that pulls the vampires out into the sun where they burn up. With the sun setting rapidly, it is time to end the day's work before the other vampires wake up. Montoya and Katrina escape in the jeep, Guiteau hides behind a counter in a restaurant, finding a shotgun, but Valek catches Jack and ties him up. Jack wonders why Valek just doesn't kill him. Suddenly, Cardinal Alba steps out of the shadows. Admitting he was the one who betrayed the slayers, he says he's struck a deal with Valek, to give him immortality for finishing the ritual that will complete Valek's transformation. Meanwhile, Katrina has completed her change. She bites Montoya's neck, drinks some of his blood, and then leaves him for dead in the jeep and rejoins Valek and his vampires. Montoya shoots off a few rounds with his gun and then places the hot barrel to his neck, hoping to sterilize the bite. The ceremony is beginning, and Jack discovers that he is to part of it, because the ceremony requires a ritual sacrifice by crucifixion of a slayer at the moment of dawn. The vampires tie Jack to a cross, and Alba begins by slicing Jack's leg, collecting the blood, and passing it to Valek to drink. As the sun begins to rise, Guiteau (who has been listening to everything from his hiding place in the restaurant) shoots Alba. With no priest to finish the ritual, Valek tries to force Guiteau to do it, but Guiteau turns the gun on himself. Just when it looks like Guiteau might have to shoot himself, Montoya appears in the jeep. He fires a stake into the cross and, using the winch, pulls it down. Guiteau leaps forward and cuts Jack free. As the sun continues to rise, the vampires run for cover, with Jack and Guiteau following. They trap Valek, who leaps at Jack. Jack holds up the Bersier cross and Valek lands on it, impaling himself. As Valek attempts to pull out the cross, Jack pulls down the dilapidated ceiling. The sunlight streams in, and Valek bursts into flames. In the final scene, knowing that they have more vampires to kill, Montoya finally admits to Jack that he's been bitten twice by Katrina, who is lying in the back of the truck in order to stay out of the sun. He also says that he can no longer function as a slayer and that he intends to take Katrina south where he can take care of her. Guiteau tries to kill Montoya, but Jack steps between them. Knowing that Montoya was first bitten two days ago but still saved his life in the fight with the vampires, Jack figures he owes Montoya two days. However, he promises that, when those two days are up, he will hunt down Montoya and Katrina and kill both of them. The soon-to-be-turned vamp Montoya and the vampire Katrina drive away while Jack and Guiteau stay behind to clean up the town of the surviving vampires before pursing them.

         "Ever since I saw a documentary on the making of horror movie special effects, I've wanted to see 'Vampires'. I wasn't disappointed. In this era of cheap computer effects it's really refreshing to see a movie where the special effects are done the old fashioned way. For some bizarre reason I really like Vampires. The plot is somewhat clichéd, the acting is nothing special and yet... I find myself watching this movie over and over again. Somehow the idea of a secret military force funded by the church, dedicated to fighting vampires is thrilling even though I'm not a religious man. I suppose it harkens back to the day of witch hunters. James Woods is great as the grim, dedicated man sworn to destroy all vampires and as the true shocker, the generic Baldwin appearing in the movie does a really good job as well! If you like gory movies, check it out!",
         "I was puzzled by the low rating \"Vampires\" got, it's my favorite movie of 1998/99. Why do I give the date in that manner? I was (un)fortunate enough to see this movie in the uncut version (as shown in France), in the US version and just a few weeks ago in the German one. But first things first -- I am female and I have read so many reviews and comments telling me, that I, as a woman, should feel disgust at the alleged misogynous undertone of \"Vampires\". I am sorry, but in none of the three versions I saw did I feel, hear or see anything which might support this allegation! Crow hated practically everyone except for Montoya and the first priest, Montoya -- while quipping left and right -- behaved quite kindly towards Lee's hooker except where she directly caused him to react violently and none of the other oneliners warrant, IMO, even a raised eyebrow regarding that special topic. Let me add that I also am not religious, with my own perceptive view of enough past wrongs done by the Catholic church, so that any of the soi-disant \"hate\" directed at that church is in my opinion well-founded given the plot. Callan's explanation of how he views god, as well as several other references by Crow and Montoya underline the basic belief of the vampire hunters while maintaining their no-nonsense attitude. With that back to why I liked the movie so much: it is in its own way as stark and streamlined as the best samples of its genre; the cinematography is just perfect with the right mixture of visual and non-visual storytelling; the dialogue is engagingly humorous throughout, feels real and allows each character his or her own voice; there are several deeply moving scenes, either visually or characterwise moving, which will stay with the audience; there are enough novelties incorporated to make this rendition of the vampire theme fresh and quite frankly, I liked Carpenter's score a lot too. What wins me completely over is the very obvious fun all the actors had with their roles. James Woods was perfect as sardonic, illusion-free Crow and his brushing \"campiness\" with the tip of a finger, yet withdrawing just in time, is priceless. Daniel Baldwin makes the most of his character's arc, nicely underplaying his role, while he still manages to convey Montoya's journey by minimal changes of expression or voice. The final scene couldn't have been done any better. Sheryl Lee gives what I consider one of the strongest supports I've seen in quite a few years, whether by male or female actors, especially when you count in the scarcity of means she's handed over. Ian Griffith had several fine moments and the entire supporting cast was refreshing in their non-Hollywoody realistic, natural look and acting. The overall impression was of people enjoying what they're expertly doing. An advice to the German audience, I noted while watching the dubbed release that the translation killed practically every single punch line and nearly all of the humor. And it *could* have been translated properly. The voice actors dubbing for Woods and Baldwin did so without recreating even a tenth of what both actors put into their voices in the original version. I do think that some of the disappointment expressed there is due the extremely low quality of the translation and dubbing. See the movie in its original language. I also can't see any reason for the loss of those scenes which were cut out of the US release when compared to the French one. The movie loses quite some strength this way.",
         "The movie opens with a trained, fully-equipped team of vampire slayers, led by Jack Crow (James Woods), methodically purging a \"nest\" of its fanged occupants. This is one of the best scenes of the movie and sets the viewers up to think, \"Hey, these guys know what they're doing. They're some rough-and-ready characters.\" But, lo, where is the master vampire? Not to worry, he'll have his chance at revenge...later that very night, as the \"trained\" vampire hunters go to the nearest town, lay down their weapons, and begin drinking and whoring. And they knew full-well that a master vampire, whose \"subjects\" they'd just fried, was still lurking about! How stupid can you be???!!! The movie marches on, showing carnage and betrayal as the plot is advanced. (And, frankly, it's not a bad plot). But there are many holes, many questions that are not answered, like, Why was such an mysterious and important item (a cross that would permit a vampire to walk in the sunlight) guarded by such a inept group of robe-clad nincompoops, who, according to their own harried screams, knew \"The day has arrived!\"? If they knew that a particularly horrific \"day\" was inevitably going to \"arrive,\" why, then, did they lack even a modicum of defensive capability. Why were they caught frantically scampering around like a herd of panty-clad Dr. Smiths (from TV's Lost in Space...\"Oh the pain, the pain of it all...\"). Oh well, we'll never know, and they're too dead to tell us. Be that as it may, this movie does have some good dialogue, interesting characters, a unique idea or two, and an actual plot--which makes John Carpenter's \"Vampires\" stand head and shoulders above most of the horror movies that are out today. I enjoyed it despite its defects.",
         "\"Vampires\" is great popcorn entertainment. While fans will always compare Carpenter's later movies with his early genre classics, \"Vampires\" is excellent entertainment, even if it isn't an \"important\" or \"milestone\" horror event. James Woods is not the most likable of heroes here but he's very watchable. Daniel Baldwin delivers a believable performance as his dependable sidekick. \"Twin Peaks\"' Sheryl Lee plays the leggy small-town hooker who is unfortunately bit by a Master Vampire, Valek. There are also appearances from Maximilian Schell and \"Miami Vice\"'s Gregory Sierra. In Carpenter's \"Vampires\", the undead don't exit this world peacefully. Instead, they explode like giant Catherine wheels. This is exciting to watch - you can't have enough sparking vampires, can you? With lots of action and a few dark laughs, you could do a lot worse than see this movie. With an excellent score, great visuals and a fast pace, \"Vampires\" scores a strong 8 out of 10.",
         "Why is this movie so appealing? I don't know how to answer this other than what I love about it: James Woods! Vampires is a movie brought to us by horror mastermind John Carpenter who almost gave up film making because he became disgusted by how Hollywood got so greedy. I'm so glad he decided to make Vampires because if not for his touch, I think this movie could have been really bad or bland. I'm very sad to say that Vampires seems to get overlooked or shadowed when people bring up great vampire movies a lot. I think because Blade was also released the same year, so it just got lost in 1998. However, I still love this movie, it's a western horror fright film that I'm sure will have you on the edge of your seat. A lot of people complain about James Woods being too camp in his role\u0085since when did that become such a bad thing? He's so awesome in this movie and really makes it exciting. Mercenaries led by Jack Crow rids an abandoned house of vampires in the middle of New Mexico. The sun sets and, as the Slayers leave, the Master bursts out of the ground outside the house. The slayers stay at a motel in the middle of a desert, getting drunk, smoking and partying with women as they celebrate their victory. One of the prostitutes is a young woman named Katrina. When the master vampire, Valek, turns up at the motel, he bites Katrina and massacres the slayers and prostitutes. During this attack Valek sees Jack and calls him by name which astonishes Crow. Crow and his partner, Montoya, run outside and grab Katrina, take a pickup truck and drive off. Narrowly escaping from Valek, they keep on driving for a few more hours until dawn. While Crow goes back to the motel to deal with the remains of the team and prostitutes, Montoya takes Katrina to the nearest hotel. Meanwhile, Montoya has gotten another hotel room and he tells Katrina that she has been bitten by Valek and that she too will be one soon if they cannot find and destroy him. She now has a telepathic link to the Master. They are using her to find out his real plans and why and who set them up. I think between John's touch to the film it was the cast who really made this something special. James Woods brings a lot of fun to the film, being almost an extreme Rambo. Not since the Frog brothers in Rambo have I seen such passion to kill vampires. I love when he walks away from the explosion at the hotel that's a few feet behind him, I always have to say \"Yeah, I know there's an explosion behind me. What; you think I don't see explosions? I do; every day! They bore me now!\". Daniel Baldwin plays off James very well and did great being the sidekick who does stand his ground when pushed too hard. Sheryl Lee, very chilling performance at times, she doesn't do much in the film but when she does have powerful scenes, she pulls in very well with great screams. Tim Guinee, the replacement priest with no experience whatsoever, I adore him playing off James Wood's tough exterior. Him trying to stand up to James but he knows he can't win with him, however when put to the test, he really comes through for the guys and turns into Arnold Schwarzenslayer. And the final star of the film and a very haunting performance with Thomas Ian Griffith as the vampire Vallek. Great performance by him and he is a very savage vampire who reminds you that not all vampires are romantic with cheesy accents. I love the whole style of the film, it feels raw and like you're riding with the cowboys. A lot of beautiful colors of the sunset and the shadows to give you a chilling feel. This film may just require a certain taste, but I think most people do enjoy this film and I'm sure somewhere down the line, it will get the appreciation it deserves. Much thanks to John Carpenter giving the film industry one more try and bringing us a great vampire movie. 8/10",
         "I'm a big fan of John Carpenter. But in his latest films, I've noticed somewhat of a clumsy way he directs his films. It's almost as if the films were rushed and some scenes or even shots, just weren't filmed. He fades between all of his scenes... Sometimes, leaving us wanting more, but he just fades to the end of it. Sometimes, the scenes he uses could have been completly cut out and not used with the fade-technique whatsoever. Anyway, I just had to get that off my mind. Off to the plot: Jack Crow is a Master Slayer, meaning that he kills vampire for the catholic church, and has been doing that for his entire life. After he cleans out a nest of Vampires in New Mexico, his team gets ambushed my a powerful vampire named Valek. Valek kills the entire team of slayers, except for Jack and his friend Montoya. They also manage to bring a hooker along with them, who got bitten by the vampire. Using the hookers telepathic link with her master, the two try to hunt down Valek and find out what he's up to. This film is gory. Really gory. Most likely John Carpenters goriest film to date, counting The Thing. Some might think that gore is an unnecessary way of filming, but in this film: Gore is not used to \"impress\" or \"Show off\". It's used as a background thing. I didn't feel that it was a way of using the gore to create \"terror\". And if you happen to like gore, you'll find one redeeming factor in this film. The acting is good. James Woods is really funny as Jack Crow at times, altough Daniel Baldwin isn't really \"great\", nor is Tim Guinee. But the acting holds up. There's not much else to say other than that James Woods is funny... at times. The action in this film is quite abundant, yet it's not that great. It can be enjoyable but at the same time the action is very repetive. That doesn't bode very well. Another thing abut this film is that it's too damn long for an action/horror film. Its almost 2 hours long. They should have made it 90 minutes instead, as that would be more fitting of a movie of this \"type\". Well. The film is boring sometimes, yet it has some redeeming factors. All in all I give it a six. Nothing great, but if you're a John Carpenter fan you'll like it. And you might want to see how his style has changed. Dramaticly.",
         "Who but John Carpenter would have the savvy to make a \"vampire western,\" and do it so well? His WILD BUNCH is a blue-collar crowd doing a dirty job, led by the cocky James Woods (whose wisecracking but nonetheless no-nonsense approach to hunting vampires reminded me more than a little of the early SPIDER-MAN- the one written by Stan Lee and rendered by Steve Ditko). And, just for the record, the movie IS better than the book. MUCH better. Carpenter manages to evoke a sense of time and place that seems to capture the FEEL of the southwest. The music definitely helps in this regard, but it's the director's filmmaking TECHNIQUE that makes this the almost \"spiritual odyssey\" that it is. When was the last time a movie made you feel you were THERE...?",
         "Judging by the ratings this film has (34% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, 5.8/10 on IMDb), I guess it's safe to say that this could be a guilty pleasure of mine. I love most of John Carpenter's work and I really enjoyed his take on vampires. Jack Crow is certainly reason alone to sit through this and although the character originated in John Steakley's novel, I feel Crow is just as strong of a character in Carpenter's world as Snake Plissken from Escape From New York. Even though he's basically a mean spirited SOB, you can't help but sympathize with the character as the film moves on. Considering all that's happened to him in his lifetime, he seems to be a decent guy deep down underneath that extremely thick and rough exterior. His dialogue was also a lot of fun. Gems such as him asking Father Adam Guiteau if he had wood after the fight they just had or when he's explaining the true mythos behind vampires and to \"forget whatever you've seen in the movies\" was just classic. Other than Jack Crow, I actually really enjoyed the storyline which seemed to be a breaking point for a lot of people. A vampire seeking a black cross to finish a reverse exorcism, so he can walk in daylight without turning to dust. Only Carpenter could pull something like that off. Their methods of killing vampires were also a bit more original and unorthodox compared to other vampire films of the past. Jack Crow would shoot an arrow from a crossbow, which would be attached to a wire on the bottom of a jeep that would be reeled in by Daniel Baldwin's Anthony Montoya that would drag the vampire into the sunlight where their body would burst into flames. Maybe it's considered cheesy to some, but it was refreshing to see something different for a change. As big of a horror fan that I am, I don't really think of myself as a fan of vampires. I'm not sure if it's because I'm picky or because it seems like everything is being recycled when it comes to story lines in horror films these days, but I like to think when a vampire film does make an impact on me that it says more than the average horror film containing vampires. John Carpenter, the master of horror, delivers a refreshing and interesting take on vampires with the aptly named Vampires. It also dawns another strong lead character in a Carpenter film in the form of Jack Crow and contains some of the most witty and enjoyable dialogue of any horror film from the late '90s. The storyline is also magnificently peculiar, which is a definite plus in my book. This would definitely make my list of favorite vampire films, if I ever decided to make one. If you're a fan of John Carpenter and haven't seen this gem, I highly recommend doing so. Or if you have, maybe it's time to dust it off and give it another watch.",
         "* star out of **** I've never thought of John Carpenter as a great director, or even a good director for that fact. His most praised film, Halloween, I felt was his most overrated. He does crank out some decent cinema once in a while, but they usually tend to work in spite of him, very much unlike a director like, say, Brian De Palma, in which good films happen because of him. With that said, Vampires only goes to show that whatever talent Carpenter may have had is virtually gone for good. Jack Crow (James Woods) is a vampire hunter working for the Vatican. His team of slayers, who also includes Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), have just taken down a nest of the bloodsuckers in Mexico, but were unable to locate the master. As they're celebrating in a motel that night, the head vampire, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), appears and slaughters everybody present with the exception of Crow, Montoya, and a prostitute (Shery Lee) who was bitten. Crow believes the prostitute can be used to track down the vampire because of the psychic connection that is developing between the two. At the same time, with the help of a young priest (Tim Guinee), Crow discovers that Valek is looking for the Berziers Cross, which if done correctly in an incantation, can grant all vampires the ability to walk in broad daylight. A plot like that would you to believe that Vampires would be full of tension, suspense, and action. There's nary a hint of a moment where those elements come in. Instead, Carpenter opts for blood and gore, and if he was aiming for a make-up effects display, he's succeeded. The only thing that may be considered unpredictable in this film is the way Valek kills his next victim, whether it may be with decapitation, throat slashing, or just plain old sticking his hand through their bodies. The acting and script reek of the second rate variety. Now, to be fair, James Woods delivers a fun performance, which is easily better than anything else this movie has to offer. But his attempts are counteracted by his fellow thespians. Daniel Baldwin proves he's the least talented of his brothers, and I believe that says it all. Sheryl Lee resorts to ridiculous bouts of overacting, and Thomas Ian Griffith does nothing but look menacing and kill a bunch of people. The script is as equally atrocious. Whether it's the predictable story, the awful dialogue (\"He's unstoppable unless we stop him\"), or the unpleasant mysogyny, there's not a salvageable element in this entire screenplay. I'm not sure whether to blame the writer, Don Jakoby, or the original author, John Stakely. Maybe they're both at fault. A concoction of both writers' imaginations led to this script, which is probably twice as bad than what each one could have come up with individually.",
         "I know so many people went into this movie thinking \"John Carpenter\" + \"Vampires\" = horror filk. As many have commented it's not terrifying in the least because it's not supposed to be. This movie is a Western, plain and simple. Look at it this way and it's a helluva lot more fun and understandable."
