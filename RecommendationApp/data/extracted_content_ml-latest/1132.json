      "synopsis": "The film \"Manon des Sources\" (1986), together with \"Jean de Florette\" (1986), which PRECEDES IT, are the screen rendition of Marcel Pagnol's exquisite novel, \"L'eau des Collines\" (\"The Water from the Hills,\" 1963). It is the story of two competing projects, one carried out by the city-dweller Jean Cadoret, and the other by the peasant Ugolin, set in the rustic and picturesque environment of Provence in the 1920s. It is a story of opposites: the city versus the country, modernity versus traditional, good versus bad, and memory versus oblivion. \"Manon des Sources,\" takes place some ten years after \"Jean de Florette\", also in the village of \"les Bastides\" and the surrounding hills. Ugolin's carnation-growing business is prospering, as inferred when he sells his flowers to a retailer who complains about their high prices. Manon (Emmanuelle Béart) is now a beautiful, wild shepherdess, spending her time in the hills and valleys of the area, tending her flock of goats. She totally ignores \"les Bastides,\" and the villagers aware of her presence, reciprocate, calling her \"la sauvageonne\" - the wild child. She lives with her mother and Baptistine (Margarita Lozano), at \"le Plantier.\" A new character is introduced, the new village school teacher, Bernard Olivier (Hippolyte Girardot) who is also an amateur mineralogist. One day while hunting in the hills, Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), comes across Manon who is dancing nude, playing a tune on her father's harmonica. This is the proverbial love-at-first-sight. Too shy to approach Manon directly, he continues to spy on her, following her in the hills. He sets traps to capture birds and rabbits, which he then places in her traps as gifts. From then on, Ugolin is obsessed with Manon. César Soubeyran (Yves Montand), \"le Papet,\", who had been pushing a reluctant Ugolin to marry in order to continue the Soubeyran line, is thrilled when Ugolin finally confesses, although in a rather unusual manner, his matrimonial intentions. Ugolin decides to \"move in\" and propose to Manon in a most clumsy and outrageous manner. She is repulsed by \"the toad\" and runs away from him (Actually, in real life, Daniel Auteuil was briefly married to Emmanuelle Béart). Sometime later, Manon overhears two hunters from \"les Bastides,\" Pamphile (André Dupon) and Cabridan (Pierre-Jean Rippert) discussing how Ugolin had plugged the spring on her father's property, and the fact that everybody in the village knew of the existence of that spring and kept quiet about it. Manon runs away, crying and screaming: she is crushed, and she swears to take revenge on Ugolin, César , and the whole village. Her opportunity arrives when she discovers a cave containing the source of the spring which supplies the water to Ugolin's property and to the village's square's fountain. She blocks the course of the spring: this is an unmitigated catastrophe for the whole village. At first, Ugolin fetches the needed water for his flowers from the spring at \"le Plantier,\" the way poor Jean used to do, but this is only a makeshift solution. Without the spring's flow, his carnation business is doomed, as will be the whole village. The village council summons a Government expert who basically tells them that they are on their own. The following Sunday, the church is packed for the high Mass. The priest (Jean Bouchaud) tells the congregation that this disaster is God's response to a criminal act perpetrated by one among them. He calls for a procession to bring the spring back to life. Following the Mass, the entire village gathers in the school yard to celebrate Bernard's birthday. At this gathering, Manon publicly accuses Ugolin and César of having plugged the spring. Her accusation is backed up by Eliacin (Didier Pain), who had been a witness to the bad deed. Although admitting to no wrongdoing, Ugolin totally breaks down and falls to his knees, imploring Manon to marry him. Many of the assembled villagers confess their treachery, as César drags a crushed Ugolin out of the assembly and back to his house. Sometime later, César summons the mayor, Philoxène (Armand Meffre), and Belloiseau (Lucien Damiani), to \"les Romarins,\" where they find Ugolin hanging from a tree, the same tree where young Manon's swing used to hang. Bernard, invoking the memory of her father, convinces Manon to unplug the spring. The two set out in the middle of the night to free the water. The next day, as the priest's procession is taking place, the water starts flowing again from the village fountain. \"Miracle!\" some shout, but for Philoxene and others, it is mere coincidence. Bernard and Manon get married, and soon she is with child. An ancient village resident, the old, blind Delphine (Yvonne Gamy) returns to \"les Bastides.\" She often meets with César in front of the church at dusk. During one of these meetings, Delphine recalls to César a certain letter that Florette had sent to him while he was in the army. This scene is the most heart-wrenching that one could imagine. Following Delphine's revelation, César loses all will to live, and one evening, after having confessed to the priest, he takes to his bed, and dies peacefully.",

         "This is just as good or even better that it predecessor, Jean de Florette (1986). It is amazing how well thought out the story is. Like a Greek tragedy, everything falls into place, everything is accounted for as fate conspires with character to bring about retribution for those who did wrong. We feel sad and sorry for Papet and Ugolin, whose weaknesses and \"crimes\" are so like our own. Daniel Auteuil, who plays Ugolin, is a actor with great range and sensitivity. He is unforgettable here as a not-too-bright peasant who suffers an excruciating and hopeless case of unrequited love. And Yves Montand, who plays his uncle is flawless, like an Olivier, as he experiences a very cruel turn of fate. Emmanuelle Béart, who plays Manon, is very beautiful, but she is also strange enough to be believable in an unlikely role as a solitary shepherdess of the hills of Provence. Claude Berri's direction is so perfectly paced, so full of attention to detail and so unobtrusive and natural that the film just seems to happen without effort. Nothing fancy, just show what needs to be seen, no more. Use no more words than necessary, but all that are necessary. It's almost like magic, how easy it looks. The scene near the end when the blind woman reveals the cruel turn of fate to Papet is exquisite in its simplicity and its effectiveness. In a sense this movie is a throw back an earlier era in cinema when careful attention to the construction of a character-driven story was the essence of the art. (Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",
         "I always felt that the week I needed to show the two films was worth the time for the students: they heard other-than-Parisian accents and they saw truly fine films! I enjoyed watching them as well, but I always went to the front of the room toward the end of Manon so I could watch the reaction of the students at the \"revealing\" scene near the end. One year, a young lady whom I did not particularly like was glued to the TV closest to her: her eyes widened, her mouth gaped, and perfectly silent tears started to flow down her cheeks. Not a motion, not a sound...just tears. I decided I liked her quite a bit more than I previously had!",
         "For those of you English-only speakers who don't like sitting through foreign language films with either their dubbing or having to read subtitles, retain an open mind. Rent \"Jean de Florette\" and its second part \"Manon of the Spring\" tonight. Sit back and relax, and you will have more than just the wind knocked out of you from this cinematic masterpiece. The late Gene Siskel, bless his soul, placed these films on his top ten list for the year of 1987. The American Academy completely ignored these films; the British Academy awarded \"Jean de Florette / Manon of the Spring\" Best Film of the year. You will find tears coming to your eyes simply from seeing the stunning beauty of the French countryside and the farming life. It'll make city dwellers long to breath the fresh country air! You will be captivated by all the very unique characters brilliantly portrayed by the actors. A \"hunchback\" played by good old Gerard Depardieu is full of love for life and his veins are afire with excitement for putting into practice some innovative ideas about farming. But, little does he know that his neighbours, pretending to be friendly, are filled with greed and jealousy, and are plotting and scheming against him behind his back. Part 1: \"Jean de Florette\" ends tragically, but just wait till you see the sun of justice gradually rise in Part 2: \"Manon of the Spring\". At the end of \"Jean de Florette\", the \"hunchback's\" daughter overhears the neighbours talking and realises that they were scheming against their family the whole time and sabotaged their farming. In \"Manon of the Spring\", she has grown up, having kept to herself over the years. But she comes across farming neighbours talking about what happened in the past and she can no longer let them go unpunished. She burns up inside. What makes matters worse is that one of the neighbours that conspired against her father falls in love with her and chases her through the countryside, shouting, \"Je t'aime! Je t'aime!\" (\"I love you! I love you!\"). The film ends with a series of shocking revelations that the viewer could never have guessed. The plot comes full circle and couldn't be more ironically perfect! Your soul will be left glowing. These movies will shower you with gold. (10 out of 10 for both films)",
         "Manon of the Spring is the sequel to Jean de Florette, released the same year. By no means should Manon be rented without having first seen Jean. By no means, in either case, should one glance at the movie notes on the reverse side of the video box. Almost nothing can be said safely about Manon without giving away the overall plot or this or that twist or turn. Suffice to explain that Jean concerns an urbanite hunchback who relocates to the Provencal countryside with his wife and daughter, intent on raising rabbits. Manon picks up some years after the Jean conclusion, with the daughter having grown to young womanhood. (More prudish prospective viewers need to know that this will be explicitly evident.) This is superb movie-making. Other reviewers accurately call it a masterpiece. The story line dominates, not the acting. Even so, Yves Montand continues his excellent performance from Jean, and Daniel Auteuil as the unsightly nephew is more impressive after one sees him clean-cut and sophisticate in something like Un Coeur en Hiver (1992). Emmanuelle Beart and Hipployte Girardot say very little, yet it doesn't detract from their respective essential portrayals. Anyone who becomes a Beart fan is advised to rent Nelly & Monsieur Arnaud (1995). The two movies, prequel and sequel, work as a team. By virtue of its powerful denouement, however, Manon of the Spring is the standout of the pair. For the same reason, in my opinion, it is one of the very best films of the 1980s.",
         "This (and Jean de Florette) is the most moving, well thought out film I have ever watched. The countryside makes me long to go to France, to where it was filmed, to see \"Les Romarins\" and \"Les Bastides\". The music is like an eerie prayer that reminds my soul of \"pauvre Galinette et ses rouges oeillets, et Papet Soubeyrans, et Manon Cadoret\". The red carnations are a haunting image... Both books are as good as the movies; I recommend anybody who likes this film to buy them (if you can read French, that is!). I would give everyone, Marcel Pagnol, Claude Berri, etc etc a gold medal for these works- well done! By the way, have a look at the earlier version of \"Manon des Sources\". An actress called Jaqueline Pagnol is in it -she is the wife of Marcel Pagnol who wrote both books!",
         "This is a good sequel to \"Jean de Florette\" which was made earlier in the year. Both movies should be seen back-to-back to make this story complete and comprehensible. Actually, this really could be called \"Jean de Florette: Part Two.\" \"Manon Of The Spring\" features Emmanuelle Beart, who has to have one of the prettiest faces ever put on film. She plays the now-grown-up woman who gets revenge on the men who ruined her father when she was a little girl. As in the first film, this has interesting characters. The cinematography isn't quite as striking as \"Florette,\" but still decent. There are some neat twists at the end of the story, tying all of it together. The 113-minute film starts slowly for the first third but then picks up nicely to become a memorable story. Remember, you shouldn't watch this film without seeing the one first.",
         "\"Jean de Florette\" ends very tragically and with great unfairness. It's a very ingenious idea because now the audience is practically dying to see \"Manon des sources\". Cesar Soubeyran and Ugolin simply can't win, it just wont do. Even though the sequel shows how hunchback's grown-up daughter Manon (enchanting Emmanuelle Béart) finally revenges all the cruelty and evil she and her father had to put up with, \"Manon des sources\" is actually even darker and more melancholy and dismal than the first film and not even half as funny. The ending turns out to be even twice as unhappy. All the same both of these movies are fantastic and \"Manon des sources\" only slightly weaker, I guess mostly because of the intelligible absence of Gérard Depardieu's charmingly sympathetic character who was the heart of the previous movie. French cinema at its best, \"Manon des sources\" is perfect and massively emotional drama and a movie experience you will remember rest of your life. 10/10.",
         "Following the death of her father, Manon (Emmanuelle Beart) has remained in the farm house tending goats. Galinette (Auteuil) and his uncle Cesar (Montard) have greatly prospered from the fresh spring water and their carnations grow well. Galinette begins to turn towards ideas of love and steadily falls for the distant Manon. Meanwhile she has discovered the treachery that once befell her father and begins her plan to uncover the culprits. This follows on from the open-ended story of \"Jean de Florette\". Time has passed and Manon is now a beautiful young woman. This film will satisfy those who felt the bleak ending of the first film was not satisfying. This sees those who acted in greed receive their deserves. As a conclusion to the story it is satisfactory - the film begins quite relaxed and is quite humorous throughout. However the \"punishment\" of both Galinette and Cesar is moving. Cesar's fate is particularly impacting and you feel sorry for him and his greediness. The performances are not as strong as before. In the first film both Montard and Auteuil had set characters to play. Here they are less set and act out their roles rather than their characters. Beart is good as Manon, but she is too different in heart from the angel of the first - it's understandable why she has changed but where she was since the last film is not clear, it's unlikely that her mother would have left her at the farm or that she would have let her leave to return. But this is a minor complaint over a moving tale of deserves. I would say this rather than revenge - because both Galinette and Cesar bring their pains upon themselves. My only problem with this is that it follows the story of the first film. However to me the first film was more about human nature (greed & hope specifically) rather than the story of the farmland and the spring. Although the end of Jean de Florette was bleak it was perhaps understandable that things should end that way. That said this is a good conclusion to the story if that's what you want - although as a further look at human nature it doesn't convince as well as the first did. Manon des Sources is a good film that has all the visual beauty of the first film and continues the strong emotive story - as a pair of films they are an excellent piece of work. However for me, the first film is so strong in all areas that it leaves too much for the second to live up to. A moving sequel that almost manages to live up to what went before.",
         "After spending 2 hours with Manon, I'm still in shock, but in a way I saw it coming. The film proves that greed only last for a certain time, but love and being a good person is what lasts forever. That's where happiness lies. Our crimes pay, it will eventually catch up with you, and this picture tells us best. I won't say anymore. The picture is as amazing as the first, Jean de Florette.",
         "Ten years after the death of Jean Cadoret, his wife has returned to the life of opera singer and his daughter Manon (Emmanuelle Béart) has grown up and become a gorgeous lonely shepherdess. Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) is now a thirty year-old wealthy bachelor planting carnations. His grandfather Cesar Soubeyran (Yves Montand) presses him to get married to carry the name of their family since he is the last man alive. When Ugolin sees Manon on the fields, he falls in love with her, but the shy Manon is infatuated with the school teacher Bernard Olivier (Hippolyte Girardot). One day, Manon overhears the conversation of two locals about the vile action of Ugolin and Cesar and she plots revenge against the two scoundrels blocking the spring of the whole town. While the farmers and the dwellers despair and the mayor summons a water specialist from the city, the priest organizes a precession. Later Cesar has a conversation with the blind Delphine (Yvonne Gamy) that discloses a secret about his beloved Florette. Definitely \"Jean de Florette\" and \"Manon des Sources\" are among the best films I have ever seen. The revelation in the end of the story is unpredictable and closes this engaging story with golden key. The beauty of Emmanuelle Béart and the haunting music score are mesmerizing. I only regret that the Brazilian title is actually a spoiler. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): \"A Vingança de Manon\" (\"Manon's Revenge\")"
