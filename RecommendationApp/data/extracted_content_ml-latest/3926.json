         "I still remember seeing this film at movie theaters way back when I was a lad. Of course I didn't hear very much of it due to all the shrieks and squeals from the teenage girls in the audience over Frankie Avalon. That curiously enough didn't matter because Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is a very visual film. It might seem a little old hat today, but we've been through two more generations that have seen the United States Navy become an atomic fleet of submarines and surface carriers. It was only seven years earlier, in 1955 that the U.S.S. Nautilus was launched as our first atomic submarine. In homage to that wonderful visionary Jules Verne who foresaw atomic power one hundred years earlier the Navy named it after that famous undersea ship of Verne's great novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The nuclear submarine was a wondrous thing in 1961. The idea of a nuclear power submarine was the brainchild of Admiral Hyman Rickover. Rickover was a tough minded s.o.b. who usually got whatever he wanted by any mean necessary including bullying. Hard to believe that the gentlemanly Walter Pigeon could play him, but he did and well as Admiral Harry Nelson, the ersatz Rickover. What's happened here is that the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds the Earth has caught fire and temperatures are climbing all over the world. The planet is doomed, but Walter Pigeon's got an idea to save it. Fire a missile and seed the belt with more radiation, kind of a nuclear backfire and the blaze will end. A lot of people are telling him it won't work, but Pigeon brushes them all aside. The only two who have faith in him are his assistants played by Peter Lorre and Barbara Eden. But our intrepid admiral pushes through. Of course the U.S.S. Seaview encounters all kinds of obstacles along the way, but that's the rest of the story. The cast does very well for itself and young Frankie Avalon as a junior officer comes off rather nicely. Frankie sings over the title credits, but during the movie plays a trumpet. Avalon in fact was a trumpet virtuoso and a singing career was an afterthought. The fickle finger of fate. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea still a nice science fiction adventure even though it is dated.",
         "Walter Pidgeon leads fellow iconoclasts aboard a giant, futuristic (for 1961) submarine in a desperate race to save the world from firey oblivion. Another reviewer once commented that there was plenty of action but precious little logic in this film, but so what? If one views it as escapist nonsense, it's pretty enjoyable, even if the plot does get a little overheated (sorry, we couldn't resist) toward the end. Van Allen belt catching fire? Absurd. Three thousand foot crush depth for a Thresher-class attack sub? Ridiculous. But again, so what? The effects hold up pretty well, there's a solid cast including Peter Lorre (not his last film but clearly his days were numbered), Michael Ansara, and Frankie Avalon, who was thrown into the mix to attract a younger audience, and, of course, the giant octopus. The octopus scene was actually shot in reverse, since octopi are quite timid and this one could not be coaxed into attaching itself to the submarine for any usable length of time. Seriously though, in spite of bad science and stupendous leaps of questionable logic, \"Voyage\" is a better than average vintage sci-fi flick. Make a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy the ride!",
         "I had ordered Voyage to The Bottom of The Sea on DVD and at 3:00 in the morning I found myself watching it. Okay, the idea of the Van Allen radiation belt catching on fire is silly, but it's just the premise for a really good sci-fi adventure film that I wish I could've seen in the theaters on a wide screen. But the rich colors on the DVD and Dolby sound is a good substitute for the real thing. In looking at it, I can't help but compare the movie with the series that followed as there are some of the actors from the movie who ended up in the show. Seeing this Lee Crane constantly arguing and second-guessing Admiral Nelson is a little disturbing, yet the movie inspired one of the best sci-fi series of the '60s. And the movie itself, like Fantastic Voyage, shows great creativity. Irwin Allen is always being underestimated by people with 60 second attention spans, but this movie shows how much of a creative artist that Allen was. I gladly give this movie 8/10",
         "A solid piece of science fiction that's fairly dated, \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" was a film from the old school of exposition film making. Half docu-drama and half science-fiction, Allen's production makes an effort to mix the world of tomorrow, as it was perceived in the late 50s and early 60s, with then contemporary drama. The result is somewhat stilted, and immature in a very innocent sort of way, but worth a look if you need some vintage sci-fi on your screen. The exposition of what Irwin Allen felt \"the future\" of scientific defense in the realm of the world's oceans feels like a Disney documentary. The drama almost seems as an afterthought to the technology being depicted (which I'm sure isn't too far off the mark), and doesn't really ever click in. An egalitarian para-military that is the crew of the USOS Seaview, was no doubt an inspiration for the Star Trek franchise as it was first conceived, as were probably the scientific functions of a government vessel manned by what is ostensibly a crew serving aboard a vessel whose role is part defensive and part scientific. It is in this capacity that the story takes shape, and challenges sub and crew as the fate of mankind hangs in the balance. Scientific loopholes abound: Ice floats (the breakup of an iceberg would not produce sinking chinks of ice), radiation doesn't catch fire (the Van Allen belt is speculated to be a result of USAF atmospheric nuclear tests in the 1950s), the most advanced attack subs today can not dive beyond 1300 feet, active sonar is rarely used, etc. etc. etc. But, if you can get by all that, and forgive some of the earlier film making stylings in this film, then it's worth a look. It's not classic vintage sci-fi in the conventional sense, but one clearly sees how it influenced generations of sci-fi films to come afterwards, as well as spawning the eventual TV series that evolved from this film. Give it a chance, but don't expect too much. If you're a younger viewer reading this review, then you'll probably get somewhat impatient with it. Even so, try to keep in mind the kind of film it is, and the time in which it was made.",
         "Now this is sci fi, I like to see. An underwater adventure, involving a powerful nuclear submarine that moves like the great blue whale. Only a different color. I first saw the lunch box when I was in New York, and there was the title, the sub, and the menacing red octopus attacking a mini-sub. The cast of the movie were perfect. I would later remember that Barbara Eden(\"I Dream of Jeanine\") and Michael Ansara(The Blue Djinn) have their memorable roles 4 years later on TV. She really puts on a show in the break room when the Lt. plays his trumpet down hard! The scenes are amazing, and I think that octopus is really a minor threat in the movie. He looks too uncooperative. The special effects are good, and the backgrounds, are OK. This movie is one of the best in scifi. I wouldn't disagree with anyone about it! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",
         "Three years before the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea TV series, Irwin Allen made this excellent movie. The TV series used the same submarine and a lot of the interior sets used in the movie. The atomic powered submarine Seaview is sent on a mission to try and destroy a ring of fire that has appeared around the Earth. Cities are being destroyed and many people are being killed through this. They have to face several dangers before doing this and these include giant squids, a mine field, another submarine and its torpedo's and saboteurs on board. One of these tries to blow up one of the Seaview's reactors but is then eaten by the shark in the Seaview's aquarium. Then the other saboteur tries to blow up the Seaview with a bomb but the crew manage to stop him and the nuclear missile is fired and the ring of fire disperses. The world is saved. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea has excellent special effects and a good theme song. An excellent cast too: Walter Pigeon (Forbidden Planet), Joan Fontaine (The Witches), Barbara Eden, Peter Lorre (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Beast With Five Fingers) and Robert Sterling. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is a must for all sci-fi fans. Fantastic. Rating: 4 stars out of 5.",
         "Like most of us, I saw this movie as a kid paying 50 cents I recall. Now it is shown on Fox Movie Channel in letterbox and full-length, so I can really enjoy it again. Folks, this is 1961, before the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy was in office, and the U.S. was ready for the space age. Movies like this one showed to me a bright future for the world. It had an acute global warming problem, and a world organization arguing how best to deal with it. No one could save the world without the Seaview, and a nuclear missile. How futuristic was that! In many ways, this is in the same category as Forbidden Planet to me. Of course the story doesn't compare, but the ideas portrayed in both surely inspired some people to pursue science and technology in their lives. It is also reminiscent of Star Trek in many ways. Casting was decent using popular, safe actors of the time. Having the \"mysterious\" Michael Ansara, the beautiful Barbara Eden, handsome Frankie Avalon, and even Floyd the Barber from Andy Griffith (\"What DID Calvin Coolidge say.\"). Also the mature and beautiful Joan Fontaine added to the movie. A lot has happened in the world since I first saw this movie, some good some not so good. However for me personally, I love this movie, and when it's on, like today, I'll skip the NFL games, kick my shoes off, and make some popcorn to watch this classic. Who knows, I might even get a short nap in. Great for a December afternoon.",
         "When i first saw this film on DVD i thought, wow! Its great, its got my favourite actress Joan Fontaine who is really good in it and i'm glad Irwin Allen considered her for the role because its a good movie for all these stars. This film was a major box office hit in 1961 and a big cult classic to this day. The sets have dated but thats part of the fun, its best viewed on DVD with the widescreen presentation. Walter Pidgeon is quite good as the captain and 'Jeannie' Barbara Eden is quite good in one of her first roles, i think. Frankie Avalon does a beautiful entry for the films title song. Its mystery and actually quite sad. The ending of the film came a big shock to me as the saboteur came out of the radioactive engine room. You'll never guess who it is! Watch this film i highly recommend it, sure the story is quite far fetched but sit back and relax, this film has more intelligence and acting power than any new movie like 'Dude Wheres My Car' or American Pie. See this film for great veterans (Fontaine, Pidgeon, Peter Lorre!, Eden and Avalon). 10/10",
         "Irwin Allens 1961 submarine flick. Although the special effects are on the antiquated side the film when it came out in 61 was state of the art. The movie led to the TV series of the same name but with a different cast. Once again Peter Lorre is on a futuristic submarine on a dangerous mission (as in Disney's 1954 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea) The world is teetering on destruction from a force of nature. The submarine Seaview with its genius Admiral Nelson aboard played by Walter Pidgeon knows how to save the world. However there are those who don't want him to succeed. All in all a good Sci Fi feature. Best if viewed in letter box. Barbara Eden is included in the cast and as always is gorgeous. Frankie Avalon, Michael Ansara, Joan Fontaine co-star. Also look for Howard McNear best known for playing Floyd the barber on the Andy Griffith show as a congressman onboard to check out the submarine.",
         "This is a disaster and science fiction movie all rolled into one. Walter Pigeon plays the captain of the ship and Joan Fontaine plays a doctor who has just recently come on board. When the come back up and find the sky is on fire and that the world is going to be destroyed when the heat is going to go too high, Pigeon comes up with a plan to save the world. Pideon goes to the UN with Peter Lorre, who plays a loyal scientist to Pigeon, but several other scientists disagree with Pigeon's plan and try to stop him. Pigeon has only two weeks to get to a certain spot on the other side of the world and his crew begins to turn on him and there is a saboteur on board who is trying to kill him. This is a bad title for this movie since they never even go down that deep. This is good for what it is and you should watch it."

         "Admiral Nelson takes a brand new atomic submarine through its paces. When the Van Allen radiation belt catches fire, the admiral must find a way to beat the heat or watch the world go up in smoke.",
         "US Navy Admiral Harriman Nelson evokes extreme views. Some believe he is the greatest scientific mind around, while others see him as a lunatic. His latest project, an atomic submarine, the Seaview, which he designed and built, is evoking as many divergent views. The Seaview is going through its final tests in the Arctic region. One day, the Seaview unexpectedly goes through a dangerous underwater ice shower - the ice pieces the size of large boulders - which Nelson and his crew ultimately learn is due to the Van Allen Radiation Belt being on fire, causing the break-up of icebergs on the surface. If the fire is not contained, it could mean the destruction of the Earth. At a UN meeting in New York to discuss what to do, Nelson states that he believes the fire will not burn out as many other scientists believe, and that he can extinguish the fire by shooting a missile at the belt in exactly sixteen days from the region of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific. His view is supported by his friend, fellow scientist, retired Commodore Lucius Emory. Unable to get orders for or against from the US government, Nelson proceeds to sail the Seaview to his intended destination, which is against the wishes of the UN. Despite being generally loyal to the admiral, many aboard the Seaview believe his action is irrational, foolish and/or reckless. Among those are: Captain Lee Crane, the sub's commanding officer; Dr. Susan Hiller, a visiting psychiatrist on board to do research of the effects of stress on the crew; and Miguel Alvarez, a civilian scientist and religious zealot, who believes that if the world is to end that it is God's fate. Caught in the middle is Lieutenant Cathy Connors, the admiral's secretary, who is still seemingly loyal to her boss, but who is also engaged to Captain Crane. These internal struggles are not the only obstacles Nelson faces, but also the regular perils of the ocean, the UN who they learn has issued a seek and destroy order of the Seaview, and a potentially mutinous crew, one of who seems to be sabotaging the mission even at the expense of some of the other crew member's lives.",
         "The Seaview is an atomic submarine designed by Admiral Harriman Nelson. On its initial launch some politicians are visiting it to see if all the money they poured into it is worth it. It is while they are at sea that they learn that the belt of radiation covering the Earth is on fire. Nelson is asked to attend some kind of international conference to determine what to do. It is while on route that Nelson comes up with a plan which he presents at the conference. Nelson proposes that if an atomic missile is launched from the Seaview at a precise moment, it will cause it to blow up. Another scientist claims that the belt will burn itself out when it reaches a certain temperature. But Nelson says that if they wait for his proposal, they will miss the window of opportunity that he told them of. Nelson leaves, boards the Seaview, and heads off to make his rendezvous with radiation belt. However, Nelson's driven manner, causes friction between him and Captain Crane, whose relationship with him is more paternal. As they push on, some of the crew members don't want to follow the admiral, and if that wasn't enough, there appears to be saboteur on board."
