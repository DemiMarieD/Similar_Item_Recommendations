         "Alright ....for those of you who can actually admit that you are annoyingly retentive on a movie having a clear plot, resolution, and all those school book-type terms from a movie, steer away from this one. You will be tearing your hair out=) *************************************************** For those of you who surf, who know what it *feels* like to ride a wave, you will appreciate this movie ( I guarantee) more than any other surf movie or documentary you've ever seen. Believe me, take it from a surfer. THESE 'ACTORS' ARE NOT ACTORS. THEY ARE WORLD-CLASS/COMPETITION SURFERS. And though those retentive people will point out that they can't act, I am saying what they do in this film is the *only* way to act. Zalman King used his head here to have three world-class surfers, ( Matt George, Shane Patrick Dorian, and Matty Liu), one of which was #1 in the world for three straight years(Dorian). I have a friend who met him and told me how cool he was and that he's actually *very* self-conscious about the gap between his teeth. I think it is beautiful to watch him try to speak without showing it in the film, because this is a reflection of his true self; his true insecurity. He is also shy about being in the spotlight, even limiting televised interviews on surfing networks. Anyway, the screen gladly welcomes him here, along with many other surfers, including many 'seniors' over 35, (one of which who invented the toe-in surfboard), who make a few cameos throughout the movie. *** IF YOU'RE A CINEMATOGRAPHY LOVER (as I am) you will LOVE this movie. The waves, the colors, the sensuality. Yes, this movie is *very* sensual. This film was directed by the same guy who made 9 1/2 weeks, and Two Moon Junction. Because the main focus is on the surfing, the tiny love story in it keeps you wanting more. Somehow everything looks sensual (ie: flowing hair, pearls falling on a seashell in slow-mo, the smiling girl on the train, the music). Everything in this movie can be freeze-framed and it would never look boring. There is always something deep within each picture the characters seem to be thinking and transferring to the screen. SIMPLY PUT, this movie is a work of art. *** IF YOU LIKE MOVIES TO ENLIGHTEN YOU, this movie will serve its purpose. It delves into the minds of these young men. It steers clear of trying to be something it's not. You end up wanting to be out there with them, riding those waves. You end up understanding, by the end of the film, why (at least Dorian) was always looking for that 'one big wave that starts all the other waves', to simply get that feeling. You'll end up wondering what would make you feel that way in your own life. It might be surfing. And YES, this movie could've been changed to a documentary on surfers, but why? They would not have had as wide of an audience, and there are simply NOT enough movies about surfing out there. People need to know more about the greatest sport on Earth. This movie is for everyone except for lazy, narrow-minded people, who can go back to criticizing movies that \"should have been documentaries\". (not to sound TOO harsh)=) peace, -Sep",
         "This film is definitely not for everyone. It is less about story, and more about life. It has a Zen-like quality about seeking for the pursuit of happiness. I am not a surfer, but I love this movie. As one who is an avid mountain biker, this film provides a dream of being able to enjoy a sport and a lifestyle to the max. Anybody who loves adventure sports would thoroughly love this movie. Not only is it fun to watch for the lifestyle, but the cinematography is absolutely amazing. It's hard to find better.",
         "Tonight I though about watching the 9PM-movie. It was called \"In God's Hands\" and I were not really sure about it. I decided to do the usual \"pre-sneak\" ; reading a few IMDb reviews plus the average rating. The <5pts rating was speaking bad about the film from all the beginning. However, I though \"I'll not let the mainstream opinion hold me down, I'll give this movie a shot\". Next review was totally different from the first one. Someone wrote about it as an excellent film, but he/she understood why people had given it such bad review, though it should be watched by people who can relate to the story / scenario / lifestyle which the film is built on. I got even more interested and eazed back in the bed, made my self comfortable and thus ready for watching the film. I saw it, really tensed to the television, even to excited to go get myself a glass of Coca-Cola during the commercials. Furthermore, now when I've seen and analyzed the film from A to Z, I can tell you, the film is really great. I couldn't find any Really wack actors, and the story worked fine with me. A few hidden \"wisdom-quotes\" made the film even more touching. Go see this one!",
         "Firstly a word about this IMDb voting business. I'm a film buff, I can and generally do find enjoyment in most films, and this is a good example. If I were voting for the screenplay, direction, acting, it would get a 3. Technically a 6, yet for the cinematography a 10. I'm not fence sitting here, as a film is generally a team effort, utilising the skills of many, and to succeed the director/producers have to pull it all together, and pull up those lagging behind, not let them pull you under. Sadly the latter appears to be the case with \"In God's Hands\", hence the fact I find it hard to give a single vote, due to this disparity of skill, But all will become clear, as you read on, Well although it's a few years old now, \"In God's Hands\" deserves some comment I feel. I've had it on DVD a few years, and only just got around to watching it a second time, (thanks to the random button on my DVD archive), as I probably would not have bothered otherwise. But having got through it, it does have some redeeming qualities, and a few mind blowing ones, hence this additional comment for IMDb. It is one of those films that could have been so much better, if only they had stuck to a core story line. Great surfing, huge waves, awesome locations, and some of the best cinematography you will EVER see, (but more on that shortly). Where it all goes horribly wrong, is the fact these amazing surfers, some of the best in the world, are simply NOT actors. They are not aided by the fact much of the dialogue scripted them, is hammy beyond belief, the result of which nearly sinks this film. Had the makers actually committed to making a surf movie, scrapped all the sub plot, and story lines used, it would have made a far better movie. Actually the scenes with Brion James, show up the leads lack of acting ability, which isn't really fair on them, they are world class surfers after all, not actors. But it is a good example of just how a skilled actor, much like good special effects are transparent, You accept the performance without a second thought. The reverse is not true, and poor performances/acting ability, delivery, timing etc, tend to stand out during much of the surfers dialogue scenes. Maylin Pultar is worth a mention here, Parisian multi talented, multi artiste, really smolders in some scenes, and knows how to pull it off too, much of the time without a word uttered, (take note lads, this is how you should have handled your dialogue as well). So back to the movie, and this is the sad bit really, this has to be one of the prettiest films of the last 20 years. John Aronson is without question a master behind the camera, knowing when to lock off, and not move the camera, to maximise the impact of some JUST PERFECT composition. When it's all out there, right in front of the lens, having the maturity to lock off, and just roll. GREAT, so seldom done these days, it is like a breath of fresh sea air. Such a shame, the writers were not as skilled. The shots filmed from right there in the surf are great too, god knows how they did that safely? The soundtrack is worth a mention here, as it is pretty good too actually, the big waves need some big subs though, but those frequencies go way, WAY down, so caution to those with unbalanced sound systems, and a preference to high volumes. So what does all this leave us with? Well a mixed bag I'm afraid. If you're a script writer, this is how NOT to do it. If you are a stills photographer, and/or have an appreciation for the golden rules, section, ratio, mean, light, shade and shadows, you will love this film, drop the audio out, cue up a CafÃ© del Mar CD, sit back and enjoy. If you're a budding cameraman, this is how it's done, make no mistake, old school rules or not, I can't think of more extreme shots, from locked off to in the surf! And if you are into surfing, you can't go wrong with this one, the surf scenes are simply great. So it is what it is, (pity they didn't just let it be).",
         "Although the acting may be lacking, the cinematography and actual surfing is fabulous. Realize when watching this almost documentary that despite the fact that their not playing themselves, each character is playing themselves. The characters of Shane, Mickey, Keoni, and all the other surfers are either using variations of their real names or their real names in this film. They are all the real thing, you can't get any better than them. The story is simple, get to the big waves and surf them while making a family or \"tribe\" as they are and learning about yourself. I own this movie and watch it whenever i need a reality check about hard things in this world. On top of everything it is the best surf movie because they are really surfing, no stunt doubles, no slight of hand camera shots, Patrick Shane and Matt are really surfing!!!!! It is a movie about surfing not about famous actors or a deep story line--JUST SURFING!!!!",
         "What can you say about a film that has thirty minutes of fantastic surfing footage but not much more at all? Well, not much more at all. In God's Hands stars three non actors (that's pretty obvious) who are also top surfers. They're the real thing. Patrick Shane Dorian, Matt George and Matty Liu really do ride this 40 plus foot monsters in this film, and really are towed onto them by jet skis. And all of that is pretty awesome. I didn't find the sound track all that appealing but I think I've been wiped out in a bit of a Morning Of The Earth time warp for twenty years now. That surfing flick, which I saw in a hall in the Coff's Harbour decades ago, just has to be one of the best films for me ever. But none of those Morning Of The Earth waves were the monsters that these lads snake down, and get murdered under. So the surfies out there, and there's plenty of them, will just have to see this fantastic wave action and they'll just have to see it on the big screen. They won't expect much more than just waves with human's sliding down them and they won't be disappointed.",
         "This movie would have to be at least one of my favourite movies, i absolutly loved it. I was shown it by my friend, and not being very interested, i payed little attention to it at the start. This is the story of how 3 young men travel round the world surfing, and ending up in hawaii. The 3 boys names are Shane, Micky, and Keoni. They spend alot of time in a place (i can't remember which one) where Keoni gets malaria and burn a giant banner. This is where Shane spends time with his love, and they go to a festival. This is all after they meet Â¿Wyatt? who is kind of following Shane who is the best in the world. As I said they end up in Hawaii where they take jet skiis into the massive 60ft waves they crash there, but Micky doesn't believe in it, he belives that modern technology shouldn't be used and it should just be you and surfboard. He paddles into a 65ft wave and gets caught on the seam flips his board and dies. This is where i was confused, i didn't quite understand why he ran away with the rock. though I've hard many theories from my family and friends. Its really sad and i think the movie was very well done. One of the most memorable scenes is where Shane is talking about waves coming from a giant. In the very very end, Shane gets dropped out at sea in Mexico and surfs a 65ft wave with no jet skii and he makes it. I rate this movie 8.5/10",
         "it is easy to criticize it. or define as a not the best movie. but it has a great virtue - the honesty. than - a kind of poetic image about a hobby. beautiful images. and something else who reminds a documentary. sure, it is not great or memorable. but it presents a not complicated story in correct manner. the passion, the death, the friendship, the small circle of few people, the personality of each, the advises for survive, the joy, pain and a kind of romanticism who can impress. a film about a risky sport and more than a hobby or competition. the good point is the portrait of a special form of solitude in middle of powerful solidarity. the strange form of hunting, adventure and madness. not the great script, not an extraordinary film. but, most important, a honest one.",
         "Beautiful photography of Bali and Hawaii. Story of obsession. What is life about... what is the meaning of our existence? what takes precedence - relationships or achievements? Anyone who is into extreme sports, extreme career or social change efforts can relate to this movie. Success in one area can mean loss in other areas. Relationships take time as do great achievements. Which horse do you want to ride? Protagonist takes a small boat to Mexican island and he throws his waterproof backpack into the water and then continuity seems off as he paddles away without his stuff. Maybe he meant to leave it there.",
         "My boyfriend is a surfer and one night I rented this movie for us to watch. When he was out of the room I started it and as soon as he heard the waves crash he ran into the room. The movie is great because it has great action to keep the guys interested but there is an underlying romance between the extremely gorgeous Patrick Shane Dorian and a really pretty costar that makes it a good movie for couples to watch. My boyfriend was very appreciative and I'm sure any other guy would be too."
