      "synopsis": "Mischievous 12-year-old Ingemar (Anton Glanzelius) gets into all sorts of trouble, which drives his mother (Anki Lidén) crazy; Ingemar does not know that his mother is in fact terminally ill. When he and his older brother become too much for her, they are split up and sent to live with relatives. Ingemar ends up with his maternal uncle Gunnar (von Brömssen) and his wife Ulla (Kicki Rundgren) in a small rural town in Småland. Gunnar and Ingemar bond over Povel Ramel's recording of \"Far, jag kan inte få upp min kokosnöt\" (a free rendition of the original song). In the town he encounters a variety of characters. Saga (Kinnaman), an assertive tomboy his own age, likes him, and shows it by beating him up in a boxing match. Among the more eccentric residents is Fransson (Magnus Rask), a man who continually fixes the roof of his house, and Mr. Arvidsson (Didrik Gustavsson), an old man living downstairs who gets Ingemar to read to him from a lingerie catalog. Later, Ingemar is reunited with his family, but his mother soon takes a turn for the worse and is hospitalized. He and his brother go to stay with their uncle Sandberg (Leif Ericson) in the city, but his wife thinks the boy is crazy. After his mother passes away, he is sent back to Småland. Mr. Arvidsson has died in the interim; Gunnar and Ulla now share the house with a large Greek family. Gunnar welcomes him and consoles him as best he can, but the house is so crowded, he has Ingemar live with Mrs. Arvidsson in another house. Meanwhile, Ingemar becomes the object of contention between Saga and another girl. When they start fighting over him, he grabs onto Saga's leg and starts barking like a dog. She becomes upset by his strange behavior and gets him into the boxing ring. During the bout, out of spite, she tells him that his beloved dog (which he had thought was in a kennel) was actually euthanized. This, along with his mother's death, is too much for him and he locks himself inside Gunnar's one-room \"summer house\" in the backyard. The time spent here forces Ingemar to reflect on the death of his mother, the loss of his dog and a changing world. Ingemar uses the experiences of others and of his own personal loss to reconcile a life which is sometimes tough. The movie ends with the radio broadcast of a famous heavyweight championship boxing match, between Swede Ingemar Johansson and American Floyd Patterson. When Johansson wins, the whole town erupts with joy, but the now-reconciled Ingemar and Saga are fast asleep together on a couch. Throughout the film, Ingemar tells himself over and over that it could have been worse, reciting several examples, such as a man who took a shortcut onto the field during a track meet and was killed by a javelin and the story of the dog Laika several times, the first creature sent into orbit by the Russians (without any way to get her back down).",

         "This is an emotionally powerful (and sad) film about a boy coming to terms with the fact that his mother, who he loves dearly, is dying. It is also about being a child in a world where everyone older than you treats you with great condescension. Adults make decisions affecting his life without so much as asking for his opinion. No one talks about death, but it is in the back of his mind at all times. Everyone tries to hide what is really going on, as if \"what you don't know won't hurt you\", but the boy is hurting badly. There are no car chases, shoot-outs, or space aliens in this film. This film is about real life, about growing up, and about children's sexuality. It is told wonderfully well, from a child's perspective. A magnificent film.",
         "In 1950s Sweden a 12 year old boy Ingemar (Anton Glanzelius) is sent to live with relatives. His father is away and his mother is slowly dying of some unnamed disease (I think it's tuberculosis) and can't handle him (he's VERY mischievous and always getting in trouble). With his relatives he grows up and learns how to deal with life, love, feelings of abandonment, sex etc etc. Sounds pretty obvious but it isn't. This film is beautifully directed by Lasse Hallstrom and perfectly captures what it's like to be a young boy growing up. That it takes place in 1950s Sweden makes no difference--all young boys go through the feelings and emotions shown in this movie. Some posters have complained about a (brief) instance of a topless young girl. Well--like it or not, kids that age DO think about sex and do \"explore\" their feelings with other kids. I actually think it's great that this film didn't shy away from that subject. Glanzelius is just great in the role and has a VERY expressive face (some of the looks he gives are fascinating and hilarious too). An excellent film. This was a surprise hit in the US in 1985. It was so big Glanzelius actually toured the country with his parents to promote the movie. I remember seeing it in 1985 and loving it--it still holds up. A must-see.",
         "I finally got to watch this film from beginning to end last night, after having caught glimpses of it on television. What is there in this film not to love? Beautiful Swedish landscapes in summer and winter. Attractive blond haired children or women. Hilarious eccentrics who spend their entire lives hammering nails into their roof shingles. Children on the cusp of puberty who engage in a completely unrepressed journey of sexual discovery without tilting the film into x-rating. This is a true story based on the life of a real child whose mother was a famous Swedish writer, who had a terrible temper and also died of a disease of the lungs. As a special, there is a delightful interview with the director which is insightful on several levels. He talks about what it was like working with the child actors and how natural they were about their work. He talked about how he only realized how unconsciously hooked into the film he had become after seeing it several years after completion. The reason given was that he too was the child of a famous writer/mom who needed her space and privacy. He too had children and then was divorced. So, on many levels he found the film a cathartic experience AFTER he had watched it in a theater and watched how other people responded. What is clear about this film is that it is charming without being cheap or smarmy. The unpretentious manner in which a touching and sad story is told is such a joyful antidote to the average Hollywood film. Unlike most American films which say too much, are too loud and spoon feed all thinking into the audience with the assumption that we are dumb, insensitive and unable to connect the dots, this drama delights with it's simplicity, allowing the drama to come to us in an unhurried telling. This film won several awards and most deserving it was. At the end we both cry and smile at the outcome. What is strengthening to know, is that the real life boy whose story this is, thrived. A really great film indeed.",
         "This odd little film relates the story of Ingemar, a boy who learns about life, death, loss, and practically everything else. The boy is a charming little fellow, and all the odd people he meets are also charming in their own ways. Because his mother is dying and his father is off in some other part of the world, he and his brother are split up. Ingemar goes to live with relatives in another town. There he must learn the meaning of the strange things that happen in life. He develops a simple but profound philosophy: no matter what happens to him, \"It could have been worse.\" He even has to deal with the thought that he was not wanted by his parents. He distances himself from the pain in his life by comparing his predicaments to things he has heard about in the great, strange world beyond the little town where he lives. This is an amusing, quaint film that shows us that life goes on no matter how difficult and hurtful it seems. Not only that, we can smile like the little boy in the face of all adversity.",
         "My Life As A Dog, now this is a total delight. The film follows the life of Ingemar in his 12th year as he has to cope with the slow death of his mother. The film takes place in 1959 in Sweden, and is just right in its atmosphere. Hallestrom works wonders with Anton Glanzelius as Ingemar, and he gives a marvelous performance that is truly touching and real. When his mother can no longer care for him and his older brother, Ingemar is sent off to his Uncle who lives in a small town in which it seems that all the residents work at the glass factory, and he soon becomes part of the town's fabric. His adventures are many,and includes his learning to box from the town tomboy who worries about her budding breasts, the chaperoning of the lovely town beauty as she poses nude for a sculptor, and his reading of a lingerie catalog to a dying old man. The film has been accused at least by someone on this list as being pornographic and prurient which is idiotic and stupid. This is a film about childhood and like most childhoods the film includes several scenes about children's growing awareness and curiosity about sex and their bodies and presents it in a real and sensitive way. A word of warning about the DVD transfer of the film. It stinks. Not only is it not letterboxed, but is full of flaws and looks no better than a video, but it is subtitled, and is still a joy to watch. One of the ten best films I saw in 1985.",
         "\"Mit liv sum hund\" directed by talented director Lasse Hallström is one of the reasons why I like Scandinavian movies so much. They always have this \"real\" feeling without ever overdoing things like in Hollywood movies often is the case. The story is very simple and mainly because of that it all feels very real and heartwarming. Once you have started watching this movie you can't keep your eyes of it. It's a movie you'll easily fall in love with. The movie is filled with some great, emotional and heartwarming moments that are never exaggerated or overused in any kind of way. There are some great characters, both adults and kids. I think that is the main reason why this movie is great to watch for adults as well as children. The characters are easy to relate with thanks to the \"real\" feeling of the movie. A movie that'll not easily forget. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
         "This Swedish film offers a different kind of story and a strangely appealing one. Anton Glanzelius is good as the 12-year-old who not only stars in the movie but does a good job narrating it as well. When he finds himself in a tough situation, he always compares himself to something worse, such as a Soviet space dog and its unfortunate lot. The tomboyish-looking young girl who flirts with him, Melinda Kinnaman, is fun to watch, too. I wonder what she looks like now as an adult? For kids that young, I thought there was a little too much emphasis on sex, but mostly it's just natural curiosity of what the other sex looks like, and the intentions are innocent. Overall, it is a charming film with almost all (one exception: his older brother) likable people.",
         "I'm not a great lover of subtitled films. The highest credit I can give this, is that within 5 minutes, I'd forgotten that they were even there. You cannot take your eyes of this movie. Beautifully filmed with characters who are so real that at times, you feel like you're intruding. I felt so desperately sad for this young lad who nobody seemed to want. He was clearly deeply affected by his mothers illness and was in desperate need of some kind of counselling. Instead, he was sent to live with a relative in a small town. The people there all seemed wrapped up in their little Worlds To an outsider, they all seemed a bit dysfunctional. Sex rears it head at seemingly every turn. Whether it was the dying man wanting his underwear catalogue read to him, the factory worker admiring his co-workers 'melons', the growth of teenage breasts, the artist sculpting the deeply inappropriate image of a woman and her newborn baby...Well, everyone was at it. Does everyone really think and act like this?..Well, probably more than most people think. I really didn't want this movie to end and actually felt at the conclusion, that I would miss seeing the characters. Don't be put off by the subtitles, you won't notice them!",
         "\"MY LIFE AS A DOG\" is certainly my best film. Especially when I feel somehow composed, this movie always let me notice that such an uneasiness in my heart has been washed by an extremely tender way. Instead of the eradicated dirtiness, unconsciously I get full of warm affection and mildness. About each occurrences in this movie, however, I cannot describe which scene is the most impressive, the sad, or comical, because I think there is no exactly deliberate scene but just a boy's thought and life with his mother, brother, pet dog, other relative, friends, and other villagers. The very basic natural humanity is vividly presented through those people. For example the boy, who is the main character, is normally of sensibilities and admirable as a 12 years old child. He is sometimes mischief and shows curiosity about girls, other time weeps missing his mom and his pet dog. While the boy seems to be about to get the sadness over and be going to grow mentally as well in the village. Because the people, to say the least, love to share something amusing with others. Therefore I say that the heartwarming wonderfulness produced by this movie lies in the whole elements. Any fragment cannot be separated even bright sun ray particle in a car, roof fixing noise, and so on. Every details have a reason for being in the movie actually, so feeling moved comes slowly and deeply, top that off, gently. To get a mild temper, this is one of superb movies. For me, this is the best.",
         "I just came across this coming of age movie about a boy's childhood in 1950s Sweden. I expected to change the channel but soon got caught up in the wonderful simplicity of the tale, made especially memorable by the lead performance of the boy Anton whose expressive face mirrors all of his impish thoughts. As charming as a film of this sort can be, despite the episodic nature of the telling. All of the performances are right on target and the director has woven a tapestry of individual scenes that sparkle with truth and innocence. Makes you examine your own childhood feelings of loneliness or rejection--and the explorations that all of us are subject to. By all means, a film worth watching. I hope to see it again--and this time from the very beginning. I missed some of the film and would like to see the complete work."
