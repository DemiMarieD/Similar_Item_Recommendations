         "We stumbled into \"Far from Home\" by chance. It proved to be a solid entertaining way to spend almost an hour and a half in good company. Phillip Borsos, the director, has to be congratulated for capturing this adventure that shows a boy surviving some of the worst conditions when he is shipwrecked. We would recommend this film to families with children because it shows how a boy forms a bond with his beloved dog under the worst possible circumstances. The beauty of British Columbia and its rugged scenery serve as the background to this story. A close knit family living in a rural area and loving the outdoors are at the center. When Yellow, the dog that appears at the McCormicks, Katherine and John, the parents, appear reluctant in keeping it. Angus, the teen ager son, sees more than his parents and accepts the challenge, and responsibility in keeping Yellow in check. When Angus and his father take to the water in John's medium sized vessel, they bring Yellow as well. They encounter rough seas and the ship capsizes. John hangs to the boat, but Angus is separated from his dad. What follows is a parents' worst nightmare. Every effort is made to look for the boy. It takes many days to locate Angus and when he is going to be rescued by a helicopter from the top of a tree that serves as a bridge, Yellow, his beloved dog, loses his balance and falls into a river below. Angus is saddened by the lost of Yellow, but deep inside, he never loses faith. We watch him whistling for the dog, who has responded to the signal before. Throughout the ordeal Angus never loses hope of being reunited with Yellow. Jesse Bradford, makes a great impression as the resourceful Angus. Bruce Davison and Mimi Rogers are seen as the parents. Ultimately, the trainers of Dakotah, the Yellow dog in the picture, must be congratulated for their skill in making this amazing dog perform some excellent work and its inter action with Jesse Bradford. A film for all ages, but mostly for young children thanks to Phillip Borsos.",
         "There is something quite special about the quietness and subtlety of this beautiful film. I don't think reviewers \"got\" this film. The setting is spectacular -- British Columbia. My only criticism is that the music is a bit overblown. Quite nice actually by itself, but a little over the top of the story. Nothing however can detract from the vision of the director and the wonderful acting. This film conveyed aspects of my life with childhood friends and family (and the extended family provided by Nature). It seems to say that just beneath the surface of some ordinary lifeforms, there is strength and depth. Yes! That is worth saying. I would love to have seen the film on the big screen. Jesse Bradford is great! I don't think I've seen this kid do one false thing in front of a camera. He plays or embodies youthful promise and that in-between adolescence and adulthood stage like no other actor I've seen. The same expressiveness is in \"King of the Hill\" -- astonishing really. Oh yeah, and the dog is great too!",
         "This is a locally made movie, so my expectations were low. It was a gripping tale. First, the characters were all thoroughly likable, none of the Hollywood clichÃ© petty cruelties and insults. The landscapes are spectacular and menacing. The imaginative use of mixed sound and music gives a heightened sense of reality. Even though I saw it on a relatively small screen, it has much of the emotional impact of IMAX. Of course yellow dog steals the show since she is so sincere. This is not a cute film, but a rather scary tale of getting lost, survival and rescue. Only in retrospect did I wonder how the climatic scene was done. I still wonder if everyone, including yellow dog risked their necks to shoot it. The natural world dangers in the film were similar to dangers I have lived myself, so they seemed ever so much more frightening than guns and bombs. It would be a bit too frightening for small children. Even though I knew I was being strongly manipulated by the inevitable happy ending, I could not help myself from bursting into tears.",
         "There should be more of this kind of film. This is one that the family could watch and enjoy. I find the best movies need not to have all of the bad language to make them enjoyable. It may be that someday the film industry may get the message.",
         "\"Far From Home, the Adventures of Yellowdog\" is a very simple film, very much suitable to family viewing. And in this day and age, with bathroom humor and violence very common in family films, it's very nice to see a movie which can hold interest without all that. The plot line is very simple, you can pretty much figure out the whole storyline by just reading the scene index on the DVD liner, and the acting is very basic. But where the movie truly shines is through local color and cinematography. The sweeping views of the Pacific Northwest shoreline, lush green forests, and amazing wilderness makes a viewer almost be able to breath in the fresh air. The bond between Angus and his Labrador Retriever conveys the message of loyalty and love. While you won't get a deep storyline or a life lesson like what was conveyed in \"Old Yeller\"(the original boy-and-big-yellow-dog movie),you will get a pleasant 87 minute adventure away from a sea of bad reality TV, violence, and general stupidity. Worth the $10.00 you will spend on the DVD at Wal*Mart.",
         "Far from Home - The Adventures of Yellow Dog Despite a rather ridiculous title (\"The Adventures of Yellow Dog\"?), this winning tale of a 14-year-old boy's bond with a yellow lab will warm your heart. Okay, I'm lying--but it will entertain the kiddies. It's a children's version of \"Cast Away\" after Jesse Bradford is stranded in a Canadian wilderness with his pet dog, left with only a few items for survival. Really, it's not as bad as it sounds. 1995, PG (violence). *** / *****",
         "I found this to be a most enjoyable little film. The scenery magnificent and the young stars acting I thought most enjoyable. Even the dog was good. Hell it made me want to cuddle my own dogs. A wee bit sentimental, but whats wrong with sentiment now and again. I can recommend this movie.",
         "The plot is the standard fare, touched on by quite a few viewers already. Boy meets dog, Dog and Boy get lost in the wilderness, dog and boy get attacked by wolves ( but no bears surprisingly). Good acting but no real standouts, beautiful cinematography ( the film's strongest point) Direction is weak in points, but enough to keep the film flowing. Overall a decent effort. The problem is in the script. This is a young fellow who clearly has some survival skills yet manages to throw them aside at every turn. At one point he has access to a dead deer and a cabin, yet he continues on! Give me a break. Well I suppose you need to keep the suspense in order to have a movie. However some attempt does need to be made to keep things realistic. It is very frustrating to watch a film and constantly have to ask, \"now why did he do that!\" Well,this film is entertaining enough, but the writer is certainly no Jack London.",
         "Very few films have ever been made that touch the hearts of people from young children to senior citizens. At 60 yrs old, I've seen virtually all of the boy and dog TV Shows & movies from the original Lassie series (1954) to Old Yeller (1957) on through present day. This film beats them all. Don't look for foul language, nudity, or extreme violence that are so prevalent in movies today. This film didn't need them. It is perfect just as it is, standing on it's own with a great story line, acting, cinematography and scoring. Excellently written. Angus does exactly what a 16 year old kid would do that has reasonable knowledge in survival skills and is lost in the wilderness: He stays put for several days, then afraid he will not be found in that location, he leaves a message where he is headed, then heads off in that direction trying to find his way to the lighthouse he saw before their boat capsized. In the process, he makes several mistakes that any kid his age would make. He tries to stay strong, but has those moments when fear of not making it overtake him. Jesse Bradford plays the role of the lost 16-year-old boy with impeccable realism, from the wide shots to the extreme closeups that bring the viewer right into his eyes and emotions. The supporting actors, from his parents, to little brother, to rescuers are excellent. They don't attempt to steal the movie, but are incredible as supporting actors. The cinematography is second to none, sparing no expense to capture the beauty of British Columbia but never missing the intimate, personal actions and close-up emotions of Angus and Yellow Dog. The music score and ambient background sounds are amazing. If anyone wants to study how a movie of this genre should be scored, this is the movie to study. You can watch the entire movie and never even notice the music or the ambient background sounds. That is the real test of these two areas of film making. They are there to enhance, but not overtake the movie, and that is accomplished in this film. If you want to watch a film that will touch your heart and that you don't have to be embarrassed by it's content when you have children or parents or grandparents suddenly walk in, this is it.",
         "Why can't Hollywood come up with something besides the same old stuff that plays out exactly as you know it will? Every cliche in the \"boy lost in the wilderness\" tale was brought out, dusted off, and run a little deeper into the turf. This kid was supposed to have had training in the survival arts, but he didn't have a clue as to the first rule when lost...stay put. He just kept walking farther and farther away from his rescuers while mom and pop were at home wringing their hands in agony. Of course, there was another of those idiotic wolf attacks. Enough with the wolf attacks!"

         "John and Catherine McCormick relocate from Vancouver, Canada to the coast of British Columbia, where sailing enthusiast John teaches his 16-year-old son Angus and 9-year-old son Silas basic seamanship and outdoor survival skills. Angus has rescued a stray Golden Labrador that he names Yellow, and considers Yellow to be his best friend, though John and Catherine aren't so sure Angus is responsible enough to care for Yellow. But Angus talks them into letting him keep Yellow. One day while John, Angus, and Yellow are out on the ocean in their boat, just the three of them, they drift right into a storm with hurricane-force winds, and a huge wave swallows the boat. John is found almost right away and taken to a hospital, but Angus and Yellow are nowhere to be found, because they are in the lifeboat that they had with them. The lifeboat drifts Angus and Yellow to nearby land, a strange place that seems far from any civilization. Angus and Yellow's abilities to survive in the wild are put to the test. As Angus and Yellow fend off wild animals, build a shelter, and signal for help, John and Catherine work with the Coast Guard in a desperate search for Angus and Yellow."
