         "Aaron Norris can be proud to have made the best of the three films in the M.I.A-franchise. Three things in particular makes this movie stand above the others. 1. Better action sequences and, above all, more hand-to-hand combat. 2. Good and touching dialogue. I love how Chuck's pal talks about how they \"never really CAN leave 'Nam, can they?\". And one part really makes me choke (a rare commodity in stupid B-movie action flicks!), when Chuck's wife excuses herself by saying \"I'm sorry I'm not pretty for you anymore...\". Chuck answers, like a gentleman; \"You'll always be pretty for me\" or something to that extent. 3. The ending, where Chuck gets severely wounded. A strong and unusual ending for these type of films!",
         "First of all, this movie is a fabulous example of its genre: an action movie. The action in this movie is so solid that at times it's hard to comprehend. For instance, at one point Chuck actually jumps through a window wielding a machine gun. While in midair, he holds his gun up and mows all four opponents (or victims, however you look at it) down with ease. He proceeds to run to the other side of the room, and instead of going out the front door, jumps out the opposite window. Wow Chuck.. This film also boasts some touching moments on top of the action. A gunship flies over Chuck after he has just destroyed a camp with his machine gun and sprays his area with bullets, severely wounding his shooting arm. He tries to lift the gun up to shoot the chopper, but alas, his injury is too severe. A child, freshly saved by Chuck, runs to his aid from a bush and helps him lift the gun up. In this gripping moment, both pull the trigger and take the helicopter down in slow motion. All in all, a great shoot-em-up action movie with enough character to make your girlfriend shed a tear. Maybe.",
         "Hey, when Norris learns that she is still alive, HE GOES BACK FOR HER. That's gotta count for something in these days of throw-away relationships. The final action scene is a touching \"bonding\" moment as father and son together take down the bad guy! I liked the intended, old-fashioned, \"feel good\" emotion!",
         "Rounding out my Chuck Norris Triple Feature DVD, we have \"Braddock: Missing in Action III,\" undoubtedly the best in the series and probably the only 80s action movie to come anywhere near \"Commando\" in terms of awesomeness. Here Chuck discovers that his wife and son are still alive under Communist rule in Vietnam, but the CIA is wary of letting him go there, most likely because the last time they asked him to accompany them there, he almost restarted the war. Chuck of course scoffs at this and leaves anyway (\"Don't step on any toes, Braddock.\" \"I don't step on toes, Little John--I STEP ON NECKS.\") For some reason, upon his return to Saigon, it turns out the entire Vietnamese military still wants him dead. This does make a certain degree of sense, since he caused the downfall of their government on his previous trip, but we are given the explanation that they still want him to pay for his war crimes. The same war crimes that had him imprisoned in a POW camp for 10 years! They just cannot let this go! By the series timeline, this means that the Vietnamese government has been holding a grudge against this one particular guy for almost 20 years. Either Chuck committed genocide during the war or this is the most obsessive military in all of history, but no matter, the point is that he is in danger. Once a Colonel Quoc gets wind of Chuck's presence, he ambushes Chuck, shoots his wife, and attempts to torture him and his son. Chuck of course gets away. This pisses off Quoc so much that he decides to kidnap about 40 random children out of spite. He takes the kids to a base and locks them up for God knows what purpose, and one of his soldiers attempts to rape an 8-year-old girl. Fortunately, Chuck ambushes him and implants a bomb in his stomach and his entire body explodes right in front of the girl, perhaps a bit of a hasty move on Chuck's part, but certainly way less traumatizing to her than being raped. Then he completely wipes out the base in about 5 minutes, and packs all the kids into a truck for a quick getaway while being pursued by a helicopter. Here is the movie's only true dip in logic, as the helicopter fires rockets at them and Chuck drives the truck through enormous flames multiple times and the kids inside are somehow not roasted alive. But that is a small price to pay for the levels of excitement throughout the movie. It has three times as much action as the previous installments and some convincing scenes of total chaos, as well as Chuck doing somersaults through windows even though there are doors available, all combining for a hearty 10/10. See it.",
         "This is a decent enough sequel, that's nothing special but fairly entertaining, if you put your brain in check. It's got plenty of explosions and good action sequences, however it is quite brainless so be sure to be in the mood. Most of the characters were cool, and the finale was pretty good, plus Chuck Norris is simply amazing in this!. It's a bit too routine at times, however i couldn't help but fairly enjoy it, as it's well paced and Aki Aleong is very menacing as the main villain, plus it had a few shocking moments. Don't get me wrong i enjoyed it and Chuck was fantastic as usual, it's just, too routine to really work that well, plus it was somewhat unpleasant at times. There is plenty of gunfire and action to keep one entertained for the most part, and you care for the main characters,plus the ending was pretty good. This is a decent enough sequel, that's nothing special, but fairly entertaining, if you put your brain in check, worth the watch. The Direction is not bad. Aaron Norris does a decent job here with good camera work and angles, and he kept the film at a good pace. There is a tiny bit of blood. We get a burnt corpse, bloody wounds, and some very bloody gunshot wounds. The Acting is very good. Chuck Norris AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is very likable, intense, vulnerable, but seemed a little bored here at times, still he was awesome! (Norris Rules!). Aki Aleong is great as the main villain, he was sadistic and very menacing. Roland Harrah III is okay as the son, and did his job adequately. Miki Kim was good as the wife, and did good in her screen time. Yehuda Efroni is decent as the Reverend,and was fairly convincing. rest of the cast do okay. Overall Worth the watch. **1/2 out of 5",
         "Wipe away those tears and try not to blub America, Chuck Norris is back to kill all those horrible Vietnamese Communists who survived the war and this time, he's doing it for the children, those lovable little tikes that can't fight back. And who says that old beardy death legs doesn't have a heart? Braddock: Missing In Action III is another spin on the Rambo 2 formula, with our titular hero travelling to the Orient to find his Asian wife, who he presumed killed when America pulled out of Vietnam. As you might expect from a Chuck Norris vehicle made in 1988, this is stereotypical 80s action through and through. Yes people, we're in the land of right wing politics, homosexual undertones and where everyone who cannot speak English is indescribably evil. Where you can make anything explode by shooting a Beretta at it a few times and where women are expendable cannon fodder only there to serve as a reminder that heterosexual intercourse can only lead to anguish and pain. Clichéd period piece it may be, but man is it fun. Sure, your scarf wearing hipster friends may think that Chuck Norris is only good for those 'hilarious' facts that have been going around, but what those guys often overlook is just how riotously entertaining these old movies are. Applaud as Chuck rampages through a Vietnamese military base blowing everything to pieces! Cheer as an Asian rapist gets blasted out the side of a building by a grenade launcher then explodes on impact! And jump to your feet and shout 'Hail Democracy' as father and son bond in an intimate machine gunning of a helicopter gunship. It's not big, it's certainly not clever, but anyone who can't enjoy this movie while drunk is in serious denial.",
         "In the wake of \"Rambo 3\" and a bunch of police action thrillers with Vietnam War veterans or references and homages to the war as well as the recent hits of Oliver Stone and Stanley Kubrick, \"Braddock: Missing In Action 3\" doesn't have a shot in accomplishing anything original since similar material has already been done way too many times before during the second half of the 1980's. However, Chuck Norris' starring role as the Vietnam War veteran who goes on another deadly mission to rescue more POW's prevents this film from being a complete downer but doesn't prevent it from becoming too routine.",
         "This movie was an explosive mix of drama and action. Chuck is at his finest here, as he is in almost all his flicks, and he chews up some more anti-American slime in this seasoned classic. I just wish we could all be as heroic as Chuck is. Bravo!",
         "Vietnam war vet ( Chuck Norris ) and previous POW goes back to Vietnam when is reported that a son was born . As Braddock returns looking for his disappeared wife and kid after downfall Saigon . When Braddock arrives is pursued by a Vietnam general ( Aki Aelong ). Then he schemes to free some children held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . As long as he's there , stubborn Braddock decides to head Thailand , being pursued by the former officer . The two-fisted Nam vet Colonel Braddock tries continuously to free the kids held captives and suffers various tortures in charge of the evil ruler . Braddock hunks his way through the jungle to save the waif children . He flees along with the kids and harassing his enemies pursuers , escaping the innumerable risks and dangers . From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed , transparent gore , and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing though contains some perfunctory scenes . This is a routine actioner with Karate star Chuck Norris as the Vietnam veteran resulting to be one of the best roles he'd made to date , as he's fine as tough, cold , obstinate Colonel Braddock . It's a predictable, xenophobic , shallow and brainless film though will appeal to Chuck Norris enthusiasts because of it contains some excellent action sequences ( when Braddock shoots with his machine gun , several explosions or scenes of motorboat and helicopters ) . In the ink of ¨ Uncommon courage ¨( by Ted Kotcheff ) and ¨ RamboII ¨( George Pan Cosmatos ) with Norris attempting to imitate Silvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarnezzegger like one army man . The film is the best of the trilogy , the first entry deals with Braddock who schemes to free some American soldiers still held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . The second part ( directed by Lance Hool , the first's producer ) concerns about tortures and Braddock's suffering in prisoner camp . In the three movies there are some nasty , ominous villains well played by Asian players : James Hong , Soon Teck Oh, and Aki Aelong who bear offensive racial stereotypes . Appropriate musical score by Jay Chattaway and adequate cinematography by cameraman Joao Fernandez , both of whom worked in the trilogy . The motion picture is produced in average budget by Cannon films ( Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus ) and professionally directed by Aaron Norris , Chuck's brother . It's a movie for frantic action lovers and warlike genre buffs. Rating : Acceptable, passable and entertaining but violent . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this moving film still has its fine moments getting a bemusing atmosphere with agreeable results , furthermore grossed lot of money at the box office along with the previous entries .",
         "Not a bad film for a shoot-'em-up. Suffers from the usual thin plot and lack of character development, but overall an entertaining movie. I would've liked to see more interaction between Braddock and his son; it would've given the story a little more depth to have the two talk a little more than they do. I mean, the boy has just seen his mother gunned down in front of him - it's hard to believe he would come to accept his father so quickly even given the circumstances. Of course, action is what this film is all about and, in that respect, it works!"
