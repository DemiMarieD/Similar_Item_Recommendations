         "When a movie has so much good natured humor and generally a lot of heart one can forgive anything. While it has extremely low production values and obviously made on an equally low budget, the sheer fun of it all makes this a movie that many have great affection for. Sam Rockwell's well proven off kilter charm is used to great effect. He's paired beautifully with Steve Zahn as the pitiful singing duo coerced into a life of crime. They are supported by a number of equally engaging characters such as Michael Lerner's overbearing Jewish mobster, Mark Ruffalo's soft hearted safe cracker and best of all Paul Giamatti's \"Veal Chop\". Giamatti is hilarious as well as touching as the mobster's incapable lackey. \"Safe Men\" is an affectionate ode to deluded losers. These characters are losers simply because they are desperately trying to be something they are clearly not cut out for. They are basically a bunch of good guys on the wrong track. Lerner's gangster threatens all sorts of mean acts, but ultimately just wants to give a big hug to all. Zahn's character has a strong inkling something is amiss when after years of trying to hit the big time they are playing to a very silent senior citizen audience. Rockwell, the king of deluded losers, tries to placate him with the explanation that it's a Polish custom to show appreciation by remaining silent. Maybe it appeals to the delusions that most of us at some point or another are subject to. Whatever; this may be a small, slight movie, but its an immensely enjoyable one.",
         "This is one fresh and innovative movie. Great performances by a very talented cast. The story deals with safe cracking, lounge singing and Jewish mobsters in Rhode Island. However, the real strengths of the film are the incredible performances and brilliant direction. There are no wasted scenes and the material is so fresh. Rockwell is brilliant as usual, but here he has lots of other great actors to work with. I was not aware that any critics were negative of this film, but if they were, it was due to their own ignorance. **** out of ****. You will enjoy this film, I guarantee it!",
         "If you like low-key humor and a writer/director and actors totally getting what they're doing, you'll love this movie. My only complaint is that it could have been longer and explored some more aspects of the main characters, but other that that, this is a gem.",
         "Not your cookie cutter \"Dumb\" comedy. Just little oddities that make you say, \"What the hell was that all about?\" Sam Rockwell and Steven Zahn have great comedic timing as well as a flair for understated physical comedy. It just made me laugh. . but I must warn that I've recommended this film to some of my friends, and it just didn't respond to their comedic sensibilities. Also, if you've ever been to a barmitzvah, the scene in the movie is just barely parody. Hilarious! 7 out of 10 \"Sweet 'stache dude.\"",
         "I don't know what's wrong with most of the reviewers here, but this film isn't even vaguely funny. The plot line sounded like it might be a real hoot, so I thought I'd give it a go. What a mistake. Maybe if you're Jewish and/or are from Rhode Island you'd bust a gut watching it. I got suckered in the same way by \"The Hebrew Hammer\" which probably was hilarious if you were Jewish but pathetic if you're not. A shame, because the basic story showed some real promise. Somebody with a bit of insight could have made a good indie film from it. For me, it was just boring, pointless and stupid. Some here have called this a \"cult\" film. They couldn't be more wrong. Waste of time.",
         "\"Safe Men\" is an overall rather slight but engaging farce that goes a long way on the strength of its many colourful characterizations. It might not necessarily give the viewer many belly laughs, but it's still guaranteed to put a smile on their faces. Thankfully it does have a nicely offbeat nature (thanks to writer / director John Hamburg and a talented cast) that helps to make it consistently watchable. Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn play Sam and Eddie, a not terribly gifted singing duo whose gigs are somewhat less than prestigious. But their lives take an incredible, bizarre turn when they're mistaken for professional safecrackers by \"Veal Chop\" (Paul Giamatti), the flunky of local Jewish mobster Bernie Gayle (Michael Lerner). They actually go along with this idea, although predictably they're not exactly good at the job. Sam falls for Hannah (Christina Kirk), the daughter of a local fence (Harvey Fierstein), and the *real* safecrackers (Mark Ruffalo and Josh Pais) go about their business with their customary efficiency. The actors all play this so well that you can't help but get sucked in. Rockwell, playing a lovable loser, and Zahn have fine comic chemistry, and the supporting cast is a joy to watch. Lerner is fun as the zesty mobster, Ruffalo is amusing as a lovesick sap, Fierstein is a revelation as the fence, and Giamatti is particularly delicious as the low level mobster who's loyal to the core. Overall there's a fair amount of heart and charm to this simple little film. Some of its scenes, like the bar mitzvah, are just priceless. It's mostly a low-key affair, but is just funny and quirky enough to make it well worth ones' time. You genuinely like the characters - even Lerner - and hopefully become curious to see how it will all resolve itself. Seven out of 10.",
         "\"Safe Men\" plays as if you took a nice assortment of Woody Allen comedies and put them through a blender. The Jewish jokes, including a hilarious bar mitzvah will appeal to the ethnic audience, while the outrageous ideas like exploding pants, will appeal to almost everyone. I have never seen Jewish stereotypes portrayed better, in part because of the incredible casting choices. Each character is so interesting, you will wish they each had more screen time. Sure it's ridiculous, but so are \"Idiocracy\", \"Strange Wilderness\", and \"Office Space\". Along with \"Safe Men\" the common thread between these comedies , is that each one will hold up to multiple viewings. - MERK",
         "A real surprise. I have seen this movie at the video store and passed it by before- big mistake. On HBO at 4 am the other morning, I stumbled on it again. A very sweet movie that pokes fun but doesn't condescend. Its tough to have your main characeters be stupid, work from motivations extending from their character and disposition and not seem cloying. This pulls it off. Handles friendship between the two main characters very well too. Highly recommend.",
         "This movie is hilarious. A movie about tough guys who aren't tough at all. Every character has a touch of effeminacy that makes the movie such a hysterical parody. My favorite movie of all time. Reminds me of Wes Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket\".",
         "This is such a FUN movie to watch! Yes, it's not a theatrical classic in the usual sense. But it's a pure pleasure to watch! This movie is a WINNER! I LOVE this movie! I have seen this over and over again, and STILL could see it countless times! BOTH the main characters are exceptional actors who have proven themselves in film after film. BOTH can take a small little bit part and make it stand out with a memorable characterization and performance! Sam Rockwell has proven himself not only to be a versatile character actor, but also a leading man. Steve Zahn can make ONE line seem like a soliloquy telling everything about him. His next big step should be that of a single leading man. But catch him in this movie first, so you can appreciate all the nuances of his acting. They play off of one another so effortlessly; smooooooth like butter! These two are so comfortable with one another on screen; they could make a career as a bantering duo. But obviously they have much more within each of them to offer to the world of cinema. Additionally there are numerous other characters in this film that are fun and interesting; playfully poking a little good humor within the Jewish community. I don't know if it's exactly kosher, but I say, Mazel Tov for a movie well made! shalom..."
