         "This is an endearing comedy which, as a Brit who knows precious little about baseball, I enjoyed a lot. The main reason is the performance of Brendan Fraser as the emotionally immature prodigy, Steve Nebraska. There are elements of his later role as George Of The Jungle here, although George was never this vulnerable or unpredictable. Dianne Wiest makes for a sympathetic psychiatrist and Albert Brooks is an affable rogue of a talent scout.",
         "I think sometimes people take some movies too seriously, and this is an example of one of them. This is a fantasy baseball movie, not something that would actually happen. Does anyone think that \"The Natural\" was realistic? Brendan Frasier is great in his role as a child trapped in an adult's body due to an abusive childhood, but who is one of the greatest baseball players ever. Albert Brooks is also great as the scout whose bad luck suddenly changes when he discovers him in the middle of Mexico, and is so excited about his talent that he ignores the mental problems that Frasier's character has. However, Im disappointed we never learned more of what was actually wrong with him.",
         "Poor Al Percolo, he is a man that has brought shame to the Yankees by recommending prospects to the team that don't work out. The team's general manager, Ron Wilson, wants to punish him by sending him deep into Mexico to scout new talent. When Al sees Steven Nebraska pitch in a Mexican league ball game, he realizes this is going to be his redemption. Not only is he a great pitcher, but can that man belt home runs out of the ball park! As Al stages a test to show the different major league teams what Steve can do, Steve Nebraska proves to be the man they all have been waiting for. He is signed for an awful lot of money, but he must pass a sanity test in order to join the team. No sweat! Al gets the name of a psychiatrist out of the Yellow Pages, who turns out to be Al's worst nightmare. Dr. Aaron discovers Steve is an abused child that has a lot to deal with. Michael Ritchie directed this funny comedy. Albert Brooks contributed to the screen play he co-wrote with Andrew Bregman and Monica Johnson. Mr. Brooks plays Al Percolo, the scout of the title with his usual style that makes him one of the best actors working in comedies these days. Brendan Fraser is Steve Nebraska, a complex man who loves to play baseball, but has too many unresolved issues to deal with. The amazing Dianne Wiest plays Dr. Aaron, who injects a shot of reality into the movie. There are some funny moments in the film. One of the best involves Tony Bennett, who is performing in a night club where Steve and Al have been invited by the Yankee management. When Tony Bennett introduces young Steve Nebraska as the next Yankee star, the young man takes a bout and decides to lead the house in a rendition of \"I Left my Heart in San Francisco\". The other great moment occurs when Mr. Bennett shows up to sing the National Anthem at the start of a World Series game and he sees Steve, and he asks him is he is going to have the whole stadium sing. There have been other great baseball pictures. This one doesn't try to be one of them. It's just a light movie done for laughs and the mistake most viewers make is to expect it to be what it never intended to be.",
         "As someone who knows absolutely nothing about baseball, and therefore can view the movie without that particular bias, I'd have to say it was cute. Light humor interspersed with bizarre, bratlike antics on the part of all characters. It'd almost be a good kids movie if they could have left out the swearing.",
         "Al (Albert Brooks) is, at the moment, a hapless scout for the New York Yankees. His last sure thing pitcher tossed his cookies on the mound in front of the huge crowd, just before he bolted for the turnpike. Al is sent to Mexico this time and not in any known territory. Unbelievably, in the Mexican hinterland, an American named Steve Nebraska is just waiting for Al to discover him. And, what a discovery! Steve can pitch at 106 miles an hour and hit a baseball over 600 feet, even if he is a bit weird. Al brings Steve back to NY and the Yankees, most impressed, sign him on one condition. Nebraska must pass a psychological examination! Can he do it? Will the shrink dandily named H. Aaron help? The premise of this movie, along with Albert Brooks' fine performance, are enough to sustain this movie to the end. Fraser, also, does another fine turn as the freaky kid on the block. But, one can not help but say what if. There are several loose ends that just never get tied and the result is a good movie but not a great one. Bull Durham, Major League, and It Happens Every Spring, now these are fine baseball movies. This one just doesn't measure up. Still, if you are a baseball movie fan, you will want to see this one, sure. This film is loaded with good ideas that are worth exploring and jabbering about. Stock up on hotdogs and colas and invite the baseball buddies over for a screening.",
         "\"The Scout\" is an underrated comedy, which though never quite hitting the heights gives good value in the funny-sentimental entertainment stakes and benefits from two excellent performances (Albert Brooks - in a role \"Seinfeld\"'s Jason Alexander would probably over-play on television - and Brendan Fraser). The hidden depths of the film - the young player's childhood \"abuse\" for instance - remain hidden (the movie seems shy about going there) but as old-style, far-fetched shtick the picture works very nicely.",
         "This is really an underrated gem in its own way. It's important to mention that this movie was released during the infamous baseball strike and unfortunately not many people wanted to go see a movie about baseball because they were so upset with the way things were being handled. It's really too bad because this is a very good movie. The best thing about this movie is the way director/star Albert Brooks blends his own unique style of humor with a deep underlying current of the father/son relationship and how psychological problems can effect and athlete's performance. There are some very big laughs as well as many scenes that are funny in an Albert Brooks sort of way; scenes that make you smile and chuckle rather than belly laugh. The best crafted scenes in the film however come from the way Steve Nebraska (Fraser) looks up to Al (Brooks) as the father figure he never had. Some of these scenes are very emotional and deeply touching as well. The only thing I didn't love about the movie is the ending. It's a little too neat and tidy for my taste, but let's face it Brooks is trying to make a funny and touching movie that makes you happy and uplifted when its over, and for that I say a good well done.",
         "If you ever had dreams of being a big-league star, in any sport, then you have to watch this flick. It's classic Albert Brooks. But, it is like watching a Rocky comedy. Tears come to my eyes evewn after the 10th viewing. Fraser is great. You don't need to be a sports fan to like the movie, it is good regardless. As a baseball fan, it was nice seeing Yankee Stadium. I went there in the last year of the original stadium. It was an historical stadium. Though, I hated paying $9 for a beer, but it was nice being able to take the subway to get there. Other baseball flicks that are good are \"It Happens Every Spring\" and naturally, \"Bang the Drum Slowly\".",
         "I guess Albert Brooks' comedy is not for everybody. His sense of humor is based on being loud, antisocial, sarcastic and incredibly neurotic. And that's why our senses of humor are on par with one another. I love that type of humor! And what's more amusing about his comedy is he almost never cracks a smile. Some comic actors feel the need be goofy in order to be funny. I don't believe comedy works that way. I believe the more serious you are in a scene, the funnier you are. As a matter of fact, comic actors need to be more serious in scene than dramatic actors. And Brooks is dead serious in portraying his characters. It's the fact that he's ranting and raving like a maniac, while keeping a straight face, that makes the scenes incredibly hilarious. So for everyone who's a fan of his comedy, you should feel right at home. There's tons of hilarious lines and tons of hilarious gags. Of course the story is predictable, like most sports movies, so don't expect any big surprises. And I felt Brendan Fraser's character was underwritten. But just see the movie for Albert Brooks. You should have a wonderful time! I can't wait to see his next movie, \"The Wedding Party,\" where he co-stars with Michael Douglas. I just saw the trailer this weekend. My score: 8 (out of 10)",
         "Really The Scout is a sort of dumb comedy, but that can be good. It is rather silly and that is the point. It's plot is implausible. The plot twists are odd and somewhat predictable. But I liked it and watched it more than once. So don't write it off because it doesn't fall into what the ideal of a baseball movie should be. If you write it off do it because it does not live up to its cheesy comedy roots, and frankly it odes that. If I had a VCR here I'd be running out to the Blockbuster now."

         "Al Percolo is a major league baseball scout sent to scout in Mexico as a punishment. However, he eventually stumbles across Steve Nebraska, a young American who can pitch AND hit better than anyone else can do either. He signs Steve and returns home in glory.
