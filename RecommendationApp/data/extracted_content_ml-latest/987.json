         "This movie is a difficult one to watch, but well worth it. The sex scenes have been handled with tact. This is an honest look at the marriage between a relatively stable man, and a definitely unbalanced woman. Though it's Terrence Stamp's performance that is the best, Sheffer and Lee give moving and audacious performances in this unique love story. The music is amazing. It works so well in the film, and it hightens the mood of the movie very well. Not everyone will like it. A film about adult sexuality, where sex isn't portrayed in a cartoonish \"teenage\" way, is a daring idea. But it works beautifully.",
         "I truly enjoyed this movie. I rented it to watch alone, my wife out of town for the weekend, and I am definitely going to get her to watch it with me when she comes home. There were a few scenes that strained my ability to believe, such as when the main character would attempt to advise strangers, but they ended up really just providing humorous relief. I can't really imagine the modern practice of Balthazar's profession as presented in this movie, but everything else was intuitively spot-on. The movie is erotic, but even more importantly, it is a richly layered love story, one that I personally, really became invested in emotionally. There aren't too many movies that focus on the relationship within marriage, and give powerful hope for the unimaginable possibilities within it. Bliss definitely does this. It's very real, and I thought the acting was excellent. Perhaps I'm easily moved, but I found myself sitting close to the screen, fully emotionally locked into the script. My grade? A-",
         "Movies made about problems in sex in marriage usually draws expressions of horror, or we don't want to know about it. Bliss explores one area, and there are many, of one cause and it is not uncommon, and a remedy other than traditional medicine to fix that problem. Critics have called Bliss educational to laughable and even soft porn. Foxtel Australia (released on cable May 1999) say the truth lies in- between. Foxtel saw fit to censor several scenes of the cable version, which in my opinion completely destroyed the Director's main plot and visual effects to tell the real story of something quite different in the use of another therapy, Tantric therapy. I obtained my own uncensored copy so my comments are based on visual scenes and dialogue on the therapy used, very limited but the basics are there. The film was dedicated to Pauline; Maria's characterisation could have been Pauline. There are many Pauline's in this world that have had help or still need it. The dialogue exchanged between Joseph (Craig Sheffer) and Tanner (Casey Siemaszka) on the wedding day when Joseph said, Maria (Sheryl Lee)\"she has some problems\". She sleeps with a fly swatter [little bugger], cleans the house twice a day, locked bathroom door, suicidal, neurotic, compulsive. Oh! how I know about bathroom doors and neurosis. Maria's nonchalance of her wedding day to her Mother is obvious when she shrugs her shoulders and regurgitates. This is when the plot starts to unfold Maria's mannerisms and idiosyncrasies (getting her Father to check if there is a snap undone), the nervousness and stomach upset. Through the gateway from this borderline psychotic state (we learned this later on) that Maria has, sometimes ends in Depression, and Baltazar Vincenza (Terence Stamp) stops Maria going there with the use of the ancient art of Tantric lovemaking, so it seems. It didn't take much to work out that if Maria had more therapy from the staid and clinical Alfred (Spalding Gray) she may have ended up on the wrong side of that borderline. There are some lighthearted scenes and dialogue because this movie, Bliss, is about real people, real problems and real things. The scene on the building site is especially real where Carlos and Nick advise that Baltazar Vincenzahas have 4-6 women on the hour and every hour per day and teases all of them. The uniniated into tantalic doctrine would find this perhaps laughable. The scene in the hospital where Maria is pouring out the reasons she is there is a gem. This explanation of Marias' problems comes late into the film, but that's the way it seems the Director wanted it, and it captures my imagination to find the reasons later. The on screen chemistry and interactions of Sheryl Lee as Maria, and Mark Scheffer as Joseph capture the moments magically. The special artistry of capturing what matters by Australian Cinematographer Mike Malloy (A Clockwork Orange) is again done with due care and in good taste in some of the explicit scenes, where it is important to explain visually the method of this chosen therapy. Terence Smart invigorates the movie as Baltazar Vincenza, confidently played with clear diction, precise timing (cup of tea) (like to dance) (I promise) reminiscent of the transvestite Bernadette in Priscilla Queen of the Desert, realising a different role once again. Alfred, well played by Spalding Gray as the run of the mill, we will get it fixed by conventional therapy eventually. Until Joseph asks about Baltazar Vincenza, and then the sparks fly and the film enters a new panorama of drama, explanation and entry into a New World of therapy. This movie has a tight script, well directed, excellent acting, and a very different way of surrounding the plot with something different to fix a common problem in marriage. It is a scene that few wish to be in, Vincenza (to Joseph), why do you put so much into it when you get so little back? Indeed, I know what he means. Lance Young worked with production executives of Warner Bros. And Paramount and no doubt saw some fabricated screen plots, so he took to writing his own screenplay about real things and people. He no doubt found this hard and personal, but the end result in Bliss was worth the effort. The film, in my opinion is educational to someone who knows the problems of Maria and the adoration a husband like Joseph places on his partner and marriage. The more it is viewed, the better and educational it gets, rather than having to read and view many volumes of text and videos on the subject of Tantric lovemaking, a subject that has it's poo-hoo critics. I will be waiting eagerly for Lance Young's sequel to this excellent movie, if any.",
         "This movie was a surprise from the beginning. I thought it was going to end up like a teenage sex film but was more than pleased with the film as a whole. It dealt with sexuality in a way that I have not seen in American movies. It was beautifully done, wonderfully acted by all the players and the images and content stayed with me for weeks afterwards. It is not for the prudish but if you are in the mood for a powerful film about human sexuality, marriage, and how the dance between the partners can and should be, this is a movie for you. Watch it with someone that you care deeply about.",
         "Excellent movie; treats marital problems in an adult non-salacious way that is both informative and enlightening. The nudity reveals the beauty of the human body without being pornographic. Terence Stamp makes it all work. Both Sheffer and Lee do excellent jobs as well.",
         "BLISS is a powerful, courageous film about sexual healing and the courage and love necessary to make oneself whole. It also has a lot to say about how we refer to men and women in modern American culture, and from that, how easy or unaware surface descriptions can be. Bravo to the cast and crew! A perfect 10! Every man and woman in America should see this film!",
         "I agree with the poor plot device comments previously mentioned. But I think this movie is very important. Now, I am quite OK with men, I am not a feminist, nor do I have any distaste for strong-willed or -minded men. But I think the movie is actually about the husband and about a common problem with men. Bliss presents the idea that very few western men allow the notion of a balanced male, taught in Eastern philosophies and faiths, anywhere near their minds. Stamps's character is presented as the balanced man, although almost ridiculously so. Anyway, I think Bliss shows how a man can use his strength to be a more gentle, confident leader, who is even more sexually alluring and commanding, than a common American man. In the West, men have been programmed to away from their feminine side(read: communicator, appreciative of beauty, nurturer). I think this movie wants to say that men who understand it and embrace it can do amazing things and have a great effect on the people in their world, and on themselves. This is emphasized by the abusive father. He shows the worst extreme: if left to twist up on himself, a man can become a terrible thing. And the extremity of Stamp's character is used to show how each man (ie, Craig) can pick and choose his own style. He doesn't have to be 'everything' like Stamp is, he can find his own way. I know the landslide at the end seems strange and out of place, but, it shows how Craig's character's changes helped in his own life: it gave him the patience and confidence with which to wait for his wife, and the gentleness to forgive her and try again. I think we are supposed to guess that if he had not changed, and they had split up, that a reconciliation could not have happened. I think in some ways the movie is great. Well, the story and theme are.",
         "I ended up hiring this movie because it stars the very beautiful Sheryl Lee, but I liked it when it was over. Everyone in this film gives a great performance, particularly Stamp and Lee. Sheffer is adequade and Spalding Gray is boring as he always is. I found it hard to feel unmoved by the scene in which Maria (Lee) explains to her husband why she has problems. It is very sad that someone has to go through all that pain and suffering. I see this film as more that \"a quest for an orgasm\", as my friend put it, but a well acted drama that is also very entertaining and somewhat educational. As for the sex scenes, they are very well handled and they are not dirty. There isn't much nudity (the video cover is very misleading) and people in it talk more about sex than they do it. Great film, it should be more well known and recognized. Everyone, tell your friends to watch Bliss. It makes you think about how your partner really feels in bed....",
         "If you tired of \"hard-edged\" action, booty call, and fake-it-till-you-make-it sex scenes, give yourself a real treat and see \"Bliss.\" This is a movie that entertains and educates by taking on a subject about which most people are absolutely ignorant, i.e. real Eros. With a beautiful soundtrack, intelligent dialog and fine acting, \"Bliss\" challenges our notions of sexuality and requires audiences to think outside the box. Women will recognize this film as...ah, finally! A bonus - the information about Eros portrayed in the film is absolutely accurate. This film is fine entertainment and a crash course in what sex is really all about - getting more turned on and staying that way. This should be required viewing for adolescent male Americam film-makers of all ages.",
         "I am appalled at some of the comments made by other viewers about this film. The ignorance many people have about sex is flaunted by them as \"morality\" or \"sensibility.\" What \"Bliss\" illustrates so clearly is that sexual ignorance and the patriarchal system are the things that are killing both good sex and understanding between the sexes. It's unfortunate-and yes, it's probably true as someone else here said, that for the sake of commercialism, the movie had to get an \"R\" rating and certain scenes and bits of dialogue were apparently trimmed. From what I read, one of the things left out for the sake of not getting that much-feared \"NC-17\" was the word \"clitoris.\" (Can I say that here?) It's hard to believe that a mere clinical word could cause that much censorship trouble-in a movie dealing with orgasms, at that. The movie should have left out the word \"frigid\" since the psychiatric profession no longer uses it that much, preferring \"pre-orgasmic\" instead. But there you have it. The male-dominated society we live in indeed makes certain rules-and it is those rules and how they affect sex and the destinies of the sexes, that are nevertheless gently skewered in this film. If Maria has been \"damaged\" by her past, her husband and most men have been damaged by simply being men-by playing the male role. To me this was a courageous movie, despite the censorship, because it showed a man gradually unlearning his traditional male conditioning, to the point where (spoiler) he admonishes a friend not to speak of women as body parts. True liberation means that men spread the word to other men. Did you also notice the difficulty with which at first the husband speaks about sex to another man(the therapist?) He learns to take sex seriously. We don't know how deeply he has been damaged by his upbringing as a \"normal\" American male, but at the beginning, his reactions are close to violence-while at the end, he seems to be able to accept reality without raging so much. These are important messages-and those who commented that this was just a \"sex\" film are not watching the appropriate film."
