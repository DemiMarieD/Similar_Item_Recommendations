      "synopsis": "Amityville, Long Island, New York, 1974. Set over one year before the Lutz family moved into the dreaded haunted house located on 112 Ocean Drive. The Montelli family move into what they think would be the house of their dreams. However, after discovering that there is an underground tunnel leading into the house, an evil presence is shown to be lurking within, unknown to the family. After unusual and parnormal activities, like unknown bangings on the door, an ugly message on the youngest kids of the Montelli family's room's wall (to which their father beats them after suggesting it is them who did it and also beats their mother for intervening), the Montelli mother, Dolores (Ruda Alda) tries to have the local priest, Father Frank Adamsky (Olson), bless the house but he is driven away by her sacrilegious husband, Anthony (Burt Young), who is strict and abusive, before he can properly help. Soon afterward, the family go to church with Anthony, so he can \"apologize\" for being rude to Adamsky, but the Montelli's elder son, Sonny (Magner), stays as he is \"not feeling well.\" He soon hears an alarming noise, and goes downstairs to get his father's gun, and hears laughter, following it, he then falls victim to demonic possession. Soon, a now possessed Sonny starts to have sexual feelings for his sister Patricia (Diane Franklin) and decides to \"play a game\" with her where he is a famous photographer and she is his model. She agrees and eventually ends up having sex with him. Patricia goes to tell Father Adamsky this, but has a breakdown while telling him; Sonny becomes more sinister and like a demon, as his face starts turning into a demon like face, startled he tries to keep his family away, but is unsuccessful due to the possession by the demon, who usually contacts Sonny through his earphones. On Sonny's 20th birthday he isolates from his birthday party, and calls Patricia who comes up to check on him. However, due to his demon phases and his body becoming more like a demon, he sends her away calling her a \"damn bitch.\" Patricia runs away, crying, and tries to tell Adamsky that she thinks Sonny is possessed or something, but he doesn't answer. Instead, Dolores slaps Patricia after eavesdropping on them. Later that night, the evil spirit tells Sonny to \"kill 'em\" to which he goes and gets his father's gun, shoots his father, then his mother, his younger sister, his younger brother, and after a chase finally kills Patricia. The next day the police have arrived and pick up the bodies; Sonny is arrested, but states he does not recall of ever killing his family, and is taken away. Adamsky then realizes that Sonny is possessed and asks the church if he can perform an exorcism on Sonny but they refuse, not believing him. He therefore takes it upon himself to free Sonny, and frees him from the prison and takes him to church where Sonny escapes after seeing the crosses on the doors. Adamsky soon runs after Sonny and traces him to the house, where he performs the exorcism, releasing Sonny's soul. As the cops arrive, Adamsky asks Father Tom (Robert Pine) to take Sonny away from him, while Adamsky is revealed to be possessed. His whereabouts and what happens afterwards is unknown.",

         "I liked \"The Possession\" more than the original. Part one was so phony that it was even comical in parts (not to mention the over-acting). Part two contains more real life horrors such as incest, child abuse, domestic violence and mental illness. Yes, it is loosely based on the DeFeo case. However, I believe the director avoided direct links to the incident because of possible lawsuits. One disagreement I have with William C. Uchtman is when he stated in his review that Ronald DeFeo Sr. was a swell guy. Well according to \"City Confidential\" on A&E, the father was very abusive and was reported to have beaten \"Butch\" to a bloody pulp one time for simply talking back at the dinner table. Wife beatings were also reported. So, the abuse scenes are quite valid. The part when \"Sunny\" points a shotgun at his father after he punched his wife is valid too except that, in the real case, Butch pulled the trigger with no shells inside. That was the only difference. The counterculture involved is also interesting. The Montelli's are no typical American family, you see this from the start when Sunny returns from buying a pack of cigarettes and has an arguement with his father who threatens to \"kick his ass\". Yes, \"Possession\" did copy parts of The Exorcist, but it's still a good film with more gory scenes than the original. If you like over-acted supernatural thrillers, you may enjoy the first. But if you want to see a movie based on a real murder case (though admittedly from a supernatural point of view), \"Possession\" is for you.",
         "May contain some spoilers: It's true. I have read some of the commments in here and there's are actually two people that said the exact same thing about the film. And that was that the film should have ended when the priest was looking into the house and he sees the spirit of the dead girl walking. Then the old lady comes up to him and says she has heard stories about the house. That would have been an awesome way to end it and I then would have given it a ten. As it stands I am still giving it an 8 because even though the end was contrived and straight out of The Exorcist, it is still one hell of a scary film. And if you thought you had reason in the first one to yell \" Get out!\" then wait till you see this one. The first hour of this film is absolutely terrifying. It has so much atmosphere and chilling scenes that I couldn't understand why people hated this film so much. The room in the basement is dark, dingy and the camera work is so spooky that you can't help but get suckered into believing that something is in there. When the mom is ironing and she feels something touch her arm and then the wind, that was a perfect scene. It was frightening. But the highlight of this film is when the family minus Sonny goes to church. It is here that Sonny gets stalked by an unseen force. And I even caught myself yelling at the TV, \" GET OUT! \" When he goes up the stairs and then down and then back up again into his room, it bothered me and it literally gave me chills. The camera work is so creative and haphazard that you really can't tell where the demon is. Is it on the ceiling, behind him, in front of him, where? That was a brilliant sequence in the film. Some of the acting is pretty bad especially from the mom, but it makes up for that with its chills and tension. I really think that people that criticize this film are perhaps people that should watch it again. I saw it for the first time when I was about 16 and thought it was okay, but then I rented it today and it frightened me during the day. That is pretty good film making. And is it me or are Italian directors better at good horror than the average north American director? Because I've seen some pretty scary horror films that were directed by Italians and they seem to have a style all their own. Just a thought. Amityville II is a perfect film to watch before the original. It is actually a prequel and it is good to watch them back to back. Give this film a chance and I'll bet it will scare you. It did a pretty good job on me. 8.5/10",
         "It may lack originality, it is surely inspired by both The Exorcist and Evil Dead(at least the two most obvious.), the familia matra may not be the best actress around, and you may accuse the special-effects team for having butter-fingers in the few instances you get to witness it. But then I ask you all,do you honestly think that this matter at all, when the film,all the way through to the end, positively reeks of brilliant, demonic, negative and cold atmosphere?!! For me(and it should be for every decent horrorfan!) atmosphere is the keyword when it comes down to good horror, and that's why \"Exorcist 3\", \"Woman in Black\", \"Jacobs Ladder\", \"Society\" etc. are all superb films. And likewise with \"Amityville:\"The Possession\". What is so utterly endearing with it, is the willingness to flush the pestilent flower face of joy and positiveness down the filthy drain, and if it for some nauseating reason should manage to climb up again, down again it shall be trodden!! And what twisted tones to accompany the stomping boots of night?!! Excellence!! Witness simple but superb scenes like the chasing scene up the stairs, the paintbrush honouring the wall with disharmony, the mischievous pounding on the door, the diabolical face of the golden boy,and tell me, tell me that this is not superb, twisted and dark horror?!",
         "I must admit I was expecting the first one to be a good horror flick but in the end I was really disappointed by it. However, this film (although not a sequel but a prequel) was really. In fact, the best of all the Amityville movies ever made. It didn't have any prologue or anything. The story immediately have the Montelli's family moved in to the house. Almost immediately the haunting began where as the mother (Rutanya Alda) turned on the tap and black liquid oozed out. Soon after, during the family dinner, as Dolores were saying grace the mirror cracked and fell. This was the scene that ignited the father's chain of abuse on his kids. All in all, this was the best Amityville film so far. However, it's a pity they didn't make use of the actually DeFeo's name.",
         "This movie takes place prior to \"The Amityville Horror\" (before the Lutz's moved in and claimed the house was haunted). It is based on the teenage boy who brutally murdered his entire family and believed that he did so while being possessed by forces inside the house, which is a true story. It is genuinely scary and pretty realistic (for a horror movie about demonic possession). Half of the scares come from the otherworldly evil presence in the house and the other half come from the quite realistic and not so uncommon everyday evils that occur in so many dysfunctional families. And as far as dysfunctional families go...this one takes the cake! If you were raised in a Christian household, you will probably find this movie more frightening than the average person. The soundtrack is very creepy and the actors are very likable, so you really feel sorry for them when they all bite the dust. The only complaint I have about this film is that it is too long....instead of ending relatively soon after the boy murders his family, it goes on and on with the priest attempting to exorcise the teen...and although this is where most of the special effects occur, you kind of feel bored because all of the characters you were introduced to are gone. All in all, though, it is still a very good movie and much scarier than the original.",
         "This film, though extremely creepy, is a prequel of sorts to the 1979 hit, \"The Amityville Horror.\" It is loosely based on the 1974 mass murder of the Long Island family who resided in the infamous house. Knowing the true story behind the killings made this movie all the more creepy to sit through. It is, however, highly exploitative and totally absurd during the last act. Maybe one day, a film can capture the true story of this family, without having to resort to such nonsense. This film is indeed a slap in the face to the memory of the DeFeo family. It's a good thing they changed names to either protect the innocent or avoid countless lawsuits. Otherwise, this film is somewhat entertaining if you can separate yourself from the true story.",
         "I am not a huge fan of the Amityville Horror (1979), it was okay movie but not that scary as it was made out to be. This movie starts of with a new family moving in to the house, a father and mother and four kids, two daughters and two sons. At first every seem normal, until the strange things start to happen to younger two kids as the house messed one room up but father dose believe the kids and then he hits the poor kids, then eldest son, then point a shotgun at is father to make him stop what he doing. (I have never hated anyone as much as I hated the father in this movie). Soon after Sonny the oldest of the sons start to act a bit at strange and start to feel sick, then while the whole family is out, we see how the is be come possessed by the house. Small spoiler I liked scenes where we see Sonny get possessed by the house, when we see him screaming in pain, when he stomach he being press down by the unseen evil force was really good scene, that was scary and really dark, that is the reason liked this movie more then first and this movie, it is a lot more darker then first movie and the acting was outstanding from everyone I would have give this movie 10 but I find the ending a tad boring and disappointing so I am going to give this movie a 8 out of 10",
         "Well, I tend to ignore a lot of B movies given their reputation for being under produced and of poor quality. In about August 2004, I had borrowed my brother's girlfriend's copy of this film because she had mentioned it, and I thought I'd take a risk and watch it. Anyhow, I personally found it to be a fairly frightening film. This is coming from someone who is a horror fan and has seen countless horror films, and rarely ever gets as on-edge as I did while watching this. I personally would go as far as to say it was better than the original in that it tells the story from another perspective than the original did. It focuses around a vulnerable teen, with a typically abusive father, and a typical victim family. Throughout the film, the son goes into a downward spiral until he has entirely succumb to the forces of the home his family had purchased some time before, and eventually goes to to murder his family, etc. Ifeel the story was very well told for what it was, the budget it was, and the time in which it was released. I would definitely recommend it.",
         "This is loosely based on the 1979 book \"Murder In Amityville\" by Hans Holzer, and centers on the Ronald Defeo Jr. Murders that took place on 112 Ocean Ave, Amityville New York in 1974 in which Defeo allegedly shot is entire family and pleaded everything from insanity to demonic possession. Defeo was found guilty and sent to prison, but the events that unfolded that November inspired the entire saga behind what is now known as \"The Amityville Horror\". Technically this film is the prequel to the subsequent occupation of the house by George and Kathy Lutz depicted in the first film, and comes off quite disturbing until its uneven climax. Its a perfect example of how Hollywood exploits and the how the media can take a factually tragic event in history and completely blow it out of proportion in order to entertain and amuse the masses. The facts behind the Defeo Murders and Lutz family's claims have been a controversial subject for over 30 years now, and the mystery behind the films and books continue to entice haunted house fans and skeptics alike. Nevertheless, this movie utilizes many of the same demonic, anti-Christian symbolism and clichés that can be seen in \"The Exorcist\", and some of them are quite effective. Point of view, swooping camera shots, creepy music and voices, bleeding cellar walls, and unsettling atmosphere are just to name a few as evil forces wreck havoc on an already unstable family of six fathered by closed-minded brute, Burt Young. Although the film falls painfully flat on its face after the actual murders take place, and becomes an awkward and overzealous attempt at making another \"Exorcist\" ripoff with the battle between a misunderstood priest, James Olson and the demonic entity. The final climax is convoluted and distorted, but the disturbing events leading up to it are definitely worth checking out. Followed by \"Amityville 3D\", When will Hollywood give up?",
         "Amityville II The Possession was basically the same as the first, except with a bunch of twisted ideas thrown in. But I think the ideas \"thrown in\" add a sense of kraziness into the whole story. The movie was definitely better than the first story and also gives the viewer an idea of why the house is haunted. Another part that separates this from the previous film is the music. The music provides a sense of anxiety and is perfectly matched to the film from beginning to end. The ideas of possession and incest are really great touches also. Anyways, the movie was decent and worth seeing at least once."
