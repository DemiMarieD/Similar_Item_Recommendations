         "Indeed Mark Wahlberg is a bit cack in most of his films, but The Big Hit is a masterpiece of comedy. The action is fun, but is not meant to be taken seriously. I think that some people might have watched this film expecting a standard action film, in which case I can understand their disappointment. It's just good fun and Lou Diamond Phillips is brilliant. His over-the-top performance is perfect and is something I'll never forget. The Big Hit is one of those films where you either get it or you don't. If you don't then I can understand how it might seem a bit two-dimensional. However, anyone who hasn't seen it should take a chance.",
         "I had absolutely no idea that this movie was supposed to be a silly, spoofy action film when I saw it at the theater. The first 10 minutes makes this perfectly clear. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for just being \"guilty pleasure\" escapist entertainment. Yes the movie is silly and corny - but that was the intent of the film. Its more than understandable that this movie isn't for everybody, either you love it or hate it. However, if you watched the movie and took it seriously (ie the breakdancing during the first 'hit'), then you definitely missed the point. 8 out of 10.",
         "This movie is about a day in the life of a hit man played by actor Mark Whalberg. Melvin (Mark Whalberg) has good life thanks to his talent as a hit man, but has very working class mentality going about his life. But none of the girls he associates with shares his work ethics, but just sees him as a cash cow, and a guy to dump all their troubles on to, until Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips) kidnaps a Japanese mogul Jiro's (Sab Nishi) daughter Keiko (China Chow) and dumps her on to his lap. Keiko is the first to sympathize with Melvin and hits it off with him. There are three stories going on simultaneously in this movie: One with Cisco and his boss Paris (Avery Brooks) who's a friend of Jiro's and wants the guy who kidnapped Keiko dead (not knowing that it's actually Cisco who did it). Second with Melvin's girl friend Pam (Christina Applegate) who's Jewish, and has a mother who is against her marrying this Irish Catholic guy. Third with Melvin and Keiko who's being kept at his house. All three converge at Melvin's house at lunch, and pandemonium breaks loose. The story line is one of the most original, and is a feel good movie '90s style where the under dog anti-hero gets the good he deserves in the end. The riot is seeing all the other materialistic people around Melvin all trying to take advantage of him showing how nice of a guy he is despite his choice of profession. Was this movie great ? Yes !! And is highly recommended.",
         "You must not think of this movie as a pure action movie,because it is not ment to be. This is one of the best action/comedys that are ever made. It mixes the humor with the action so well and the story is just plain nuts.The movie takes new directions all the time and it never stops to surprise you. The main characters gets involved in the most redicolues dilemmas you have ever seen and I guarantee that you will laugh many times.This movie also has some very violent scenes and some bad language.So it is not for kids. In the main roles you will find Mark Wahlberg,Christina Applegate and Lou Diamond Phillips which is my best friend Ole Martin's favourite actor. So if you are looking for a laugh and some great action then this is the movie for you.",
         "Watch Melvin Smiley's more than complicated life erupt in chaos. His fiancée's parents are coming for a visit, his (other!) girlfriend is to blame that he's kind of out of money, he really ought to return the tape of King Kong Lives... On top of all that, Melvin soon gets problems of an even worse kind. A professional hit-man, Melvin suddenly finds himself in terrible danger of getting killed by his own co-workers when a kidnapping turns out to have been a bad idea. It's crazy. Exaggerated, chaotic, full of somehow weird characters, often unrealistic action scenes, fun. I'm surprised this movie is so little known, and I am even more surprised that so many people hate it. Sure, if you expect a serious, realistic action movie, The Big Hit isn't the movie for you. You really need a sense of humour for this. Expect an action comedy, almost a parody, and you'll be entertained for sure.",
         "Mark Wahlberg portrays Melvin, a professional hit man whose financial problems make him a reluctant partner in crime in a kidnapping scheme. Melvin's closest associate, Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips) plots to kidnap the daughter (China Chow) of a wealthy foreign film maker (Sab Shimono) and demand a huge ransom in the process that will help all of their financial positions. What originally seemed like the perfect crime soon turns deadly when their boss (Avery Brooks) who also just happens to be the godfather of the kidnappee finds out about their scheme. In an effort to save his own skin, Cisco pins the entire thing on Melvin. Now Melvin is running (and gunning) for his life from a squad of deadly hit men as well as the power hungry Cisco. In the process, he also begins falling for the beautiful kidnap victim (only in the movies, folks). Sure, the film is hokey at times but it makes up for that with an abundance of gripping action scenes and hilarious comedy.",
         "When a group of hitmen kidnap the goddchild of their boss all hell breaks loose. This is plot for this awesome comedy/action thriller starring Mark Wahlberg, Christina Applegate and Antonia Sabato, Jnr. This is a high-octane comedic look at hitmen - and what would happen if you double-crossed your boss. Turn up the sound on this one, sit back, and be amazed. It's movies like this that show how good an actor Mark Wahlberg really is. 8.5/10",
         "There are some movies that you just watch to relax and enjoy some great one-liners, and some movies you watch for the hilarious plot. This is one of both of those types of movies. A situational dark comedy, watch this one when you just want entertainment that makes you laugh. This is the story of a hit-man who is trying to get ahead by doing the dirty work all of his friends create. Turns out he is very talented at what he does. If you would like to see Mark Wahlberg in an early role, I'd recommend this one. He plays the straight-man so well. The characters are so well-casted. I enjoyed the humor. To like this one, you can't take life too seriously. If you've ever seen \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", this has similar humor, but it's like \"L, S and TSB\" on Prozac. Tame enough for most of your friends, but still funny enough to get a belly-laugh. I bought it sight-unseen and have been very happy with it!",
         "Wahlberg plays a contract killer who wants no more than to be liked in \"The Big Hit\"; a solid three star flick which features good action, stunts, pyro, CGI, camera work, etc. Protag Wahlberg juggles two difficult girl friends, a double cross, and a cute kidnapee (Chow) with the demands of his profession in this not-to-be-taken-seriously film with a spritz of romance. A fun and kinetic watch for those into the crime/action/comedy/romance genre mix. (B-)",
         "When you watch this movie,you can't return it to the videostore because it's great.This is an action comedy and it will laugh you to death. There is enough action and humor in this movie,and great actors but still,...I don't know what but there something missing.If you see Pulp Fiction,you will know what I'm talking about. Melvin Smiley, a successful young hit-man, is living a normal all-day life for his Jewish fiancé Pam, but kills for money in Paris' organization. In addition, he has a relationship with a beauty from the neighborhood and gets bothered by a pimply video store guy, because he did not return \"King Kong Lives\" for two weeks. He and his three teammates Cisco, Crunch and Vince one day decide to kidnap the daughter of super-rich businessman Jiro Nishi - off the record. What they do not know, is that Jiro just went completely bankrupt due to a successes movie production, and, even worse, that his daughter Keiko is the god-daughter of Paris, the boss of the kidnappers. He and his men are now searching for the kidnappers in order to grind them up properly. Meanwhile, handcuffed Keiko falls in love with killer Melvin while both preparing a kosher meal in order to satisfy Pam's visiting parents, who are out of the house with Pam - with a body in the trunk. And when I remember of Christina Applegate,...Mmmmmmmmmmmm! I would rather recommend you Pulp Fiction,because it's more funnier and more tens than this film!But you must see this one too!"
