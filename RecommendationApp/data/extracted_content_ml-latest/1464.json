Uber weird. \r\n\r\nMore twist and turns than the highway itself :P\r\n\r\nFor sure it's fun to try and nail down exactly what happened but IMHO it's a little more fun not to know - each time you rewatch it you might see/think/feel something different.",

      "synopsis": "In the opening scene, Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) is a saxophonist who is seen sitting in his house one morning, smoking a cigarette, looking disheveled when the intercom from the front door of his house buzzes. Over the intercom, a distorted man's voice says: \"Dick Laurent is dead\". When Fred looks out a window, police sirens are heard in the distance, but the streets outside his house are empty. Fred then plays his saxophone at a nightclub that night where his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette) does not join him. Fred's performance at the Club Luna is insanely over the top. He calls his house during a break, but she does not answer (several different phones at the house are seen to be ringing). Arriving home later, Fred sees Renee asleep in bed. Fred apparently suspects that Renee may be cheating on him. The next morning, there is a mysterious package that arrives on the front doorstep containing a videotape. A very quiet Renee doesn't mention the tape, but Fred sees it and demands that they watch it (thinking it may be a sex tape of her). The tape only displays a 20-second image of the outside of their home. The releaved Renee tells a perplexed Fred that the tape \"might have been from a real estate agent\". One night Fred tries to make love to Renee, but gives up in failure. She tells him it is okay. He tells her about a dream he had: she was crying out for him, \"Fred, where are you?\" But he couldn't find her and says that he saw someone in bed that looked like her but wasn't her. When she screams in bed, he seems to wake up, but when he turns to look at Renee, it is not her and now he wakes up for real. The person he sees is a man with greenish-weird makeup and a dark wig that looks like Renee's hair. (It is the first time we see the \"mystery man,\" whom Fred meets again, as explained below.) As the days pass, another tape arrives, showing the interior of their house and even shows them in bed sleeping. Fred and Renee call the police and two detectives, Al and Ed (John Roselius and Louis Eppolito), watch the video. The two cops recommend Fred and Renee resume using their security system, and search the house for signs of forced entry. One of the departing the cops say \"We'll keep watch over the house. We'll do the best we can\" having neither found nor resolved anything. That evening, Fred and Renee go out to a party held by Andy (Michael Massee) a band manager friend of Renee. Renee is getting drunk and stumbles into Andy's arms while pleading with Fred to get her another drink. A frustrated Fred goes to the bar for a drink where he meets a strange looking Mystery Man in Black (Robert Blake), who tells Fred that if they met before and that he is at his house right now. Fred phones his house and the voice of the Mystery Man answers at the house while he's standing right in front of Fred. Fred walks away and asks Andy who the Mystery Man is and is told that he is a friend of Dick Laurent. Both Renee and Andy glance at each other with concern when Fred mentions that Dick Laurent is dead (clearing hiding something between them). Fred then forcibly grabs Renee and they leave the party. Driving home, Fred asks Renee questions about Andy and of her past connection to him, which Renee avoids answering. Arriving back at their house, Fred looks around first and finds no one around. While Renee prepares herself for bed by taking off her makeup in the bathroom, Fred walks around the dark cavern-like house and finds himself standing in front of a dark hallway resembling a vortex that leads seemingly to a unknown destination. Fred walks down the dark hallway that seemingly goes on for hundreds of feet and disappears, and he finds himself staring at a mirror reflection of himself. Renee walks out of the bedroom and stands at the base of the dark hallway and calls out for Fred, as in the dream he told her about. A minute later, shortly before Fred emerges from the darkness of the long hallway, we see a shadow moving through another part of the house. The next morning, another tape arrives and Fred watches it alone. To his horror it contains gory images of him killing Renee. He is then arrested for her murder. Fred is next shown being beaten in an interrogation room by the same two detectives, Al and Ed, who accuse him of killing his wife. A terrified Fred claims that he didn't kill Renee. But seconds later he becomes confused and immediately says to the detectives, \"Tell me I didn't kill her!\" Tried, found guilty and sentenced to death, Fred is locked away on death row in prison for the murder of Renee (a crime he continues to deny committing). Shortly after arriving, Fred is plagued by frequent headaches and is perplexed by strange visions of the Mystery Man, a burning cabin in the desert, and a strange other man driving down a dark highway. He is brought out of his cell once by the guards and to the prison infirmary complaining of \"massive headaches\" and he cannot sleep. The prison doctor gives Fred some sedatives and has the guards take him back to his cell. One morning, during a routine check of the cells, the prison guards are shocked to find that the man in Fred's cell is not Fred. The man is discovered to be Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) a young, confused auto mechanic whom the prison officials discover has a past record for auto theft. Since Pete has committed no crime aside from the auto theft five years earlier, he is released into the care of his parents Bill and Candace (Gary Busey and Lucy Butler), a former motorcycle gang couple, and he is taken home to their house in Van Nuys. At the same time, Pete is being followed by two detectives, named Hank and Lou (Carl Sundstrom and John Soiari), to find out why and how Pete ended up in Fred Madison's prison cell. Pete goes out that evening with his friends Steve V (Giovanni Ribisi), Teddy, (Scott Coffey), Lanie (Heather Stephens) and Carl (Al Garrett) along with Pete's girlfriend Sheila (Natasha Gregson Wagner) first to a drive-in restaurant, and then to a bowling alley where they have drinks and dance in the bowling alley's bar. Sheila asks Pete about his mood and his whereabouts for the last several days. Pete avoids the question by insisting that they dance. The next day, Pete returns to work at the garage where he is welcomed back by the owner Arnie (Richard Pryor) and his co-workers including veteran mechanic Phil (Jack Nance). Pete is called on by a certain Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia), a charming but hot-tempered gangster, to fix his Mercedes. Mr. Eddy takes Pete for a drive where Pete witnesses him wave a tailgater (Greg Travis) on, then rams into the guy's car and he and his two cohorts attack and beat up the driver. Mr. Eddy then drops off Pete back at the garage where the two detectives, Hank and Lou, not noticing Pete leave earlier with Mr. Eddy, sees them returning. Hank identifies Mr. Eddy as a certain criminal named Dick Laurent. Pete goes out that evening with Sheila where she questions him on his moody behavior, but lets lust sidetrack her again. Pete proceeds to have sex with Sheila in the backseat of his car while Hank and Lou continue to watch from a safe distance. The next day, Mr. Eddy returns to the garage with his Cadillac for Pete to repair and also inside the car is a beautiful blond woman named Alice Wakefield (also Patricia Arquette), Mr. Eddy's mistress. At the end of the day, Alice returns to the garage and invites Pete out for dinner. Soon, Pete and Alice begin a secret liaison by meeting at run-down motels every night. Hank and Lou continue to keep tabs on Pete to find out what he is really up to. As the days wear on, Pete begins experiencing a number of psychological problems with headaches, and strange streams of memory... the same type of psychological problems that Fred Madison had. When Alice phones Pete to cancel their nightly get-together, Pete instead rides his motorcycle to Sheila's house where he has rough sex with her, under the delusion that he is having sex with Alice. Another evening or two later, after Pete comes home from work, his worried-looking parents confront him about the recent events and say that the police have been calling them to ask if Pete remembers anything from that night that he vanished. Pete continues to claim that he has no memory about the night he disappeared and ended up in Fred Madison's prison cell, except for flashes of being on the front lawn of his house with Sheila and his parents running after him. While Pete claims not to know what happened to him that night, his parents clearly do. But for some reason that is never explained, Bill and Candace refuse to tell Pete anything about what happened to him the night he vanished. Another day later while working at the garage, Mr. Eddy pays Pete another visit where he makes an implied threat on his life by claiming that he would kill anyone whom he caught fooling around with Alice. After work, Pete secretly goes to visit Alice after work where she tells him that she begins to fear that Mr. Eddy suspects her and Pete of seeing each other. Alice tells Pete about a plan to steal money from a friend of hers so they can leave town. Alice reveals to Pete that Mr. Eddy is actually a porno producer named Dick Laurent and she tells Pete a story about how Mr. Eddy forced her against her will to do pornographic video tapes and wants to get far away from the city as possible to start a new life with Pete. Alice explains the details of her plans. She tells Pete that on the following night, she will meet with Mr. Eddy's associate Andy (the same band manager friend of Fred and Renee's) at his house. Pete will go there and stage what will appear to be a break in and he and Alice will steal money from Andy and then leave town. Pete is wary about trusting Alice, but tells her that he will think about it. That same evening when Pete comes home, he is confronted by a jealous Sheila over his infidelity. Before she walks away, Sheila tries to persuade Bill and Candace to tell Pete the truth about that night. Soon afterwards, Pete receives a threatening phone call from Mr. Eddy and his associate, the Mystery Man, who make an another implied threat on his life. Frightened, Pete calls Alice and agrees to help with her plan. The next night, Pete sneaks out of his house and away from the two detectives in their squad car. He takes a local bus and goes to Andy's house where Alice already is with Andy. Pete climbs a fence and comes in the back door that Alice has left unlocked and, while searching the house, discovers a projector of a porno film of Alice being played. He also sees a picture of the two women side by side, Alice and Renee, and asks about it. She says she is the one in blonde hair. Andy catches Pete and after a vicious struggle, Pete accidentally kills him in a bizarre accident; Andy is thrown and lands with his forehead squarely on the edge of a glass coffee table. Alice steals money and other property, and Fred and Alice flee, driving away in Andy's red sports car, but not before Pete has a nightmarish vision which implies that Alice will betray him. Arriving at a cabin in the desert (the same cabin that was in Fred and Pete's visions) to meet with their contact, Alice looks around but finds the cabin empty. Alice tells Pete that they will have to wait for a while. Alice then seduces Pete and they have sex on a blanket beside their car. When Pete whispers to Alice over and over that he wants her, Alice replies: \"you'll never have me\". When Alice gets up and walks away, stark nude, into the desert cabin, the distraught Pete stands up... and suddenly metamorphoses back into Fred Madison. Fred puts his clothes back on and searches the desert cabin. But Alice is gone and he meets the Mystery Man again with a video camera who tells Fred that Alice is actually Renee, and that Renee is a liar. Fred runs back to Andy's car and drives away with the Mystery Man videotaping and charging at him as he drives away. This suggests that the Mystery Man might be the one who made the videotapes of Fred and Renee's house. But he also seems like a supernatural character who can appear and vanish at will.... possibly even a manifestation of the devil or Death. Fred drives to the Lost Highway Hotel, a creepy-looking nightmarish place in the middle of the desert, and sees the brunette Renee/Alice checking into a room with Mr. Eddy. Fred checks himself into another room and hears Renee and Mr. Eddy having sex in the next room. A while later, Renee leaves the room to go back to her car and drive home. After Renee leaves, Fred breaks into Mr. Eddy's room, grabs him and takes him away in his Mercedes. The Mystery Man watches from another room. In the desert, Fred stops the car and gets out to open the trunk when Mr. Eddy emerges and attacks him. But the Mystery Man suddenly appears and gives Fred a knife to slash Mr. Eddy's throat. The Mystery Man then shows footage of Renee with Mr. Eddy watching a snuff film on a portable mini TV, which shows that Fred knows that he and Renee have been having an affair. The Mystery Man then shoots Mr. Eddy to death and whispers something inaudible to Fred. The Mystery Man disappears and Fred (now holding the gun) drives off in Mr. Eddy's Mercedes. Back at Andy's house, all four of the detectives, Al and Ed, Hank and Lou, are investigating the crime scene with the dead Andy until one of them notices a photo of Renee, Mr. Eddy and Andy together which they see as the motivation for Fred wanting to kill Renee (Note: Alice is no longer in the photo when Pete saw her in it earlier). One detective mentions finding Pete's fingerprints all over the crime scene. One of the detective's states: \"You know what I think? I think there's no such thing as a bad coincidence.\" In the final scene, things come full circle as Fred, still driving Mr. Eddy's Mercedes and wearing Pete's dark clothes, drives to his house where it's revealed that he is the person who walks up to the front door of his old house, buzzes the intercom, and leaves the cryptic message, \"Dick Laurent is dead\", to himself in the past. The two police detectives, Al and Ed, pull up in their squad car when they see Fred standing at the front door of his old house and move in to arrest him. Seeing the detectives advancing towards him, Fred runs back to his car and drives off with the detectives in close pursuit. As it gets dark, Fred speeds down the lost highway pursued by the police as he enters a dark vortex that appears on the road and begins violent screaming fit (like ones earlier in the film). Possibly he is metamorphosing into another person....",

         "First of all let me say, that it is not as serious, if you don't get the movies of David Lynch at once (or even never). Lynch is not a film maker who tries to make movies with a problem-solving message, but an artist. Moreover he started as a painter and so he tries to create an atmosphere more than to develop a story. Most viewers will have realized that \"Lost Highway\" is a story about a schizophrenic murderer (even Lynch mentioned it). But that is not the complete clue to the movie. Cause everyone is aware of Fred's metamorphosis (although no one seems to really care about). So his mutation seems to be real and till the end no one proves the opposite! But \"Lost Highway\" is not a common movie about schizophrenia like \"Beautiful Mind\" or \"Das weiße Rauschen\" (Which is a must-see, too!). INSANITY IS NOT THE SUBJECT, BUT THE NARRATIVE PRINCIPLE OF THE MOVIE! In other words: The movie is not a presentation of mental sickness, but a complete sick presentation, which means that the subjective perception of the protagonist becomes the objective reality! You'll find this way of telling a story quite often in surrealistic literature (i.e Franz Kafka's \"Die Verwandlung\" engl.: \"Metamorphosis\" - just note the title!!). All Lynch-Movies refer to mental illness or the state of dreaming: No character ever seems to care about the illogical and irrational twists of the plot(just like in dreams), the landscapes are unrealistic and change appearance or size and the story takes place at deserted areas (forests, claustrophobic rooms, industrial areas, desserts) far away from civilization or reality! Insanity - Sanity/ Evil - Good/ Reality - Fiction are no longer categories one can rely on. The protagonists see their surroundings and environment always threatening, but they never question it! They act with such a matter of course, that one has to ask whether it is ignorance, naiveté or self-deception. Perhaps you don't have to ask yourself how far you are able to UNDERSTAND the message. Perhaps you have to ask yourself how far you are willing to ACCEPT the message. Be aware, that once you started seeing the world at a different way you will follow that white rabbit right the way in his burrow...",
         "David Lynch is known for his art films; films that defy the rules and rubricks a movie should follow. Of course, Lynch isn't one to follow any kind of Hollywood Rule. His films always have a general sense of the surreal, of emotions only understandable to the characters and actions that defy comprehension. They always have lurid eroticism or at least one character with a sexual perversion. And, for the most part, his films are incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. 'Lost Highway' has just been defined for you, though not explained. Perhaps the film is not meant to be explainable, perhaps it is just an abstract work meant to involve us and toy with our emotions until we forget it right after we leave. But the film is memorable so that cannot be the reason. Maybe Lynch is just working out personal demons and only he is meant to benefit from doing the film. I'll explain what I mean. 'Fred Madison' [Bill Pullman] is a sax player who performs at the local club. He and his wife 'Renee' [Patricia Arquette] live in a funky Lynchian house that seems designed specifically to disturb the audience. Their marriage and sex life is not going well. One day, 'Renee' finds a videotape on the doorstep. When they play it, it is almost like a promotional video for their house, moving down every hallway before entering the bedroom where 'Fred' and 'Renee' are shown sleeping. The tape abruptly shorts out to snow. 'Fred' and 'Renee' are obviously quite bothered by this. They call the police, who don't really impact the situation in any way. Later, at a party, 'Fred' meets an ingratiating pasty-faced man [Robert Blake] at a party who calmly explains ''We've met before, haven't we'' and then goes on to explain they met at 'Fred's house and that the man is ''There right now, phone me''. He does seem to be at both ends of the line. 'Fred' immediately grabs 'Renee and they leave to go home. This leads to one of the most tense and terrifying sequences I have ever viewed on a piece of celluloid since Hitchcock. Since we know Lynch is directing, we know anything could happen......And does. I have not given away anything. In fact, the events I have described might have never happened. In fact, any event or character that enters the film may or may not have happened. The film exists in it's own queer dimension. Lynch shots the film like a noir, with 'Renee' as the femme fatale. The colors are pitch-dark and lush which helps structure the film into what it is, a psychological nightmare. It manipulates our emotions to a shocking extent and we don't know how Lynch is doing it because nothing in the movie makes sense. Lynch himself uses the phrase 'psychogenic fugue' when describing the movie as he says the hero is 'inventing a fantasy because his real life is so screwed up.' Patricia Arquette is more blatant when describing the film; 'Fred Madison is a f@#$ed up guy who invents a fantasy because his real life is so f%$#ed up. But Fred is so f%$#ed up that his fantasy falls apart...'' Makes sense to me. It would explain the bizarre events and would explain the ending. Fred is so angry and so paranoid that he has a fit in his car, twisting and whipping his head around in circles because his fantasy has gone wrong and collapsed. The film reveals clues that support this explanation. At one point, the pasty-faced man says of Renee ''Her name is Alice, if she told you her name was Renee, she was lying. And you, who the f$#@ ARE YOU!'' This suggests that Renee has used him and that 'Fred' doesn't even know who he is. If you were inventing a fantasy about yourself and you wanted to create a given persona, isn't it possible that you could forget who you were in the first place? Some people have suggested that the 'Mystery Man' [Robert Blake] is a manifestation of 'Fred's' illness. But then why does it seem that the 'Mystery Man' is trying to help 'Fred'? Perhaps 'Fred' has created the 'Mystery Man' in the hopes that this being will solve the mystery for him, to egg him on until he saves himself. And the mob boss 'Mr Eddy' [Robert Loggia] is the real villain: cold, calculating, abusive and spontaneously violent, just like a virus. And 'Renee/Alice' is just one of the virus' cohorts, reproduced from the DNA of the virus to spread the illness and incapacitate the victim. Or perhaps the most likely explanation; It is a Lynchian fantasy designed to screw the mainstream audience and entertain open moviegoers.This makes the most sense. People will always want to explain this film, to dig up it's secrets. Maybe the secrets will never be uncovered. Maybe there are no secrets and it is just a Lynch film calculated to please his fans. Any way you see it, it will never be solved. I wish you good luck if you try to solve the film in its entirety,... But you will certainly have fun doing it.",
         "Clearly, as with most of David Lynch's films, Lost Highway is not for everyone. It is, as Lynch intended it to be, a film realization of a dream. In this regard, it is comparable, in terms of artistry and raw intensity to Kurosawa's _Dreams_. Indeed, in terms of sensory experience - cinematography and sound, for example - Kurosawa and Lynch have few rivals. However, the comparison falls away rather quickly in consideration of the film's content. Lost Highway is really no dream, but a nightmare. Let's face it, like it or not, everything Lynch does is intentional. This film has inspired polarized reviews here on IMDB. Those looking for a plot-heavy movie that they do not necessarily have to pay attention to tend to despise it. Those who are open to allowing this manipulative, intensely disturbing and thought-provoking film to carry them into its own parcel of hell love it. This is, in my opinion, what good art can do. Like a dream, Lost Highway has as many plots as it does viewers with their own individual interpretations and perspectives. It forces itself upon you with a vengeance, but simultaneously encourages the kind of disengagement you experience when you are conscious that you are dreaming. I recommend Lost Highway highly. See it with intelligent, open-minded friends who like to talk about film experiences. And expect that the conversation will keep you up way past your bed time.",
         "I believe it was the legendary Homer Simpson who once gave the ideal description on David Lynch productions. During watching a \u0091Twin Peaks'-episode he said, `Brilliant\u0085but I don't get it'. Too true\u0085you love what you're seeing and you want to be a part of the mysterious Lynch universe! You actually feel the urge to search for solutions, you want to solve the riddle that is Lost Highway and you desperately try to do so\u0085until you realize it's in fact a puzzle that cannot be solved. Therefore, my advice would be: Don't try to be Einstein and develop too many \u0091theories'\u0085 just get overwhelmed by Lost Highway and enjoy the mixture of weirdness, violence and erotica you get to see. It's amazing what David Lynch pulls off here! He serves an absurd and impossible structure that involves an inexplicable metamorphosis of the protagonist and he actually gets away with it!! Meanwhile, he introduces a bunch of bizarre \u0096 but extremely fascinating \u0096 characters of which you don't know they're real or just creations of a mentally ill mind. Lynch in top-condition, in other words\u0085you almost start to suspect he's laughing with his audience. The quality of Lost Highway is brought up to an even higher level by the terrific musical score (Angelo Badalamenti), a blasting soundtrack (Rammstein!) and sublime acting. Bill Pullman and Balthazar Ghetty supply each other terrifically, even though they don't have ONE scene together. And Patricia Arquette\u0085either blond or brunette\u0085 looks gorgeous. No wonder men in this film fall into madness over her. Lost Highway comes with my highest possible recommendation, yet I still prefer the David Lynch of the lat 70's and 80's. Can't really give a reasonable explanation for this\u0085 Films like Blue Velvet and Eraserhead had something extra.",
         "This was the first time I was in anticipation of the release of a David Lynch film. Having only discovered his movies (and Twin Peaks) in the period of 1992-1997. I became a huge fan, owning several films on video as well as the complete Twin Peaks series. I was not disappointed with Lost Highway. A film that left me totally stunned. A film that I did not want to end, in the hope that I could figure out what was going on. A film that left some scenes imprinted on my brain like a tattoo. A film that is a dream. This film is what dreams are. There are times when you feel you control the dream, and times where you feel it escapes you. Slow and rapid events. Images that don't make sense. Fantasy. Horror. Surrealism. Symbolism. All part of a long dream, that I doubt anyone can decipher, including Mr Lynch. Seeing this film for the second time with a person who truly did not \"get it\" (though I thank her for her patience to watch the whole film), made realise that there are two kinds of people in this world. I love this film. I can't wait to watch it again.",
         "This is the first film directed by David Lynch I've seen, not counting The Elephant Man, which is another great film, but is an outsider in his career, since it is not surreal. This film is, however, making it the first typical Lynch film I've seen. And I'm honestly not sure what to make of it. I had heard a lot about Lynch's films before watching, but I guess I hadn't heard enough. I went into this film hoping for a good mystery, an interesting puzzle to solve. As the end credits rolled I didn't know what to make of what I had just seen. I didn't get an answer to the question I kept asking while I was watching; \"What exactly is this film about?\". As soon as the credits were over, I read a comment or two by Lynch fans... and the truth dawned on me. It's not supposed to be solved. It's not a movie where you, when you see the very end, exclaim \"Ah! Now I get it!\". This film won't provide you with some twist ending or have a character come up to the lead and explain it all. It's not supposed to make perfect sense or be easily explainable. It's not real. It's fantasy. Fiction. The whole film is like a dream, or, more appropriately, a nightmare. The film is great; it's just not for me. I won't let that affect my rating, however. This was an excellent example of masterful film-making. Lynch's direction is eminent, evidenced by the fact that I kept watching, despite not understanding half of what was going on or being able to sympathize with any character(something we are much too used to from mainstream movies). The lighting is great. Lynch really plays around with it, and it's always interesting to look at. It also really adds to the mood, nicely set by careful editing and music usage. The acting is flawless, and that is not a term I use lightly. All in all, a wonderfully well-done film, but definitely not for everyone. Wasn't in my tastes, but I enjoyed how well-made it was regardless. I recommend this to fans of art films, rather than conventional ones. Fans of Lynch should enjoy this. Very surreal and loose. 10/10",
         "I started this film upon renting it one night at 11:00 PM. I finished at about 1 in the morning. I was so stunned and awestruck that I stayed up until 3 in the morning to watch it again. This is one of the most spell-binding movies I have ever seen. Each time I see it my theory of the plot thickens. What I love about the movie is that it leaves you with the option to fill in the blanks. You will keep asking what happened and why that happened, but that is what makes the movie so awesome. David Lynch's skewed opinion of reality is very inspiring and I feel that my reality has changed ever since I watched it. Having watched it 13 times I can pretty safely say that my theory of the plot is set, but I still love to ponder exactly why.",
         "The thing that's great about Lost Highway is there is no absolute solution to the events in the film, everything about the film is open to interpretation and after you watch it you either need to thing and talk about it for a couple of hours or watch it again. In Mulholland Drive, people say that it needs to be watched twice to be fully understood. Lost highway needs to be watched about 3 or 4 time to be slightly understood and will probably never be fully understood. All the clues are there in the film but to include all of them to make sense is very difficult. However it is very rewarding to try and find out the meaning of Lost Highway. Although it is described as a modern film-noir, it's more inspired by Alfred Hitchcock. The use of music to increase the suspense of the film is used a lot here and in many Hitchcock films such as Psycho. Even if you cant work out what it is about, it is still a very tense thriller. Final Score \u0096 10/10",
         "Lighting. That's the thing I remembered most from the first time I saw this film. Amazing lighting. Certain directors, Lynch included, are able to tell the story using camera movement, what's seen/not seen. Lynch, however, has taken that a step further with the way he chooses to light his scenes - he sculpts his shots in a manner that seems almost more like a theatrical lighting designer's work. The use of shadows within the home, the stark colors that accompany certain scenes, even the car lighting in the titles - all of this is used to draw the audience's attention to a certain point, and all of it thrills. With the terse, \"European art-film\" dialogue style (at first the most distancing thing I found in Lynch's work, it is now one of my favorite elements), sharp sound work, a strong cast, and the marvelous, spiralling structure of the film only reinforcing it's strongest feature - its atmosphere - this is a work that will be discussed long after the credits fade. In my short 22 years, the best film I've seen, bar none.",
         "I absolutely loved this movie. I have always loved to watch a good flick that puts my brain to the test. Maybe the film isn't suppose to make much sense, but that's what I love about it. You have to try and analyze it and make your own theories about what just took place. This movie isn't for a lot of people and I mean a lot. You have to like movies like Mulholland Drive, Memento, The Man Who Wasn't There, etc.. to even begin to like this one. I'm not necessarily a big David Lynch fan, but this movie rocked big time. One of the most eery parts of the film is when (Bill Pullman) is making love to his wife (Patricia Arquette) and her face turns into the mystery man (Robert Blake). A very freaky looking individual, indeed. In my eyes, he represents the devil. But, that's my take on it. Another great scene is when Pete is making love to Patricia Arquette in the Desert. The lighting, music, camera angles, emotions and everything is just one of the best pieces of cinemtography I've ever seen in my life. My recommendation is this: If you liked Mulholland Drive, Memento, Pulp Fiction, Fargo, The Man Who Wasn't There, Blue Velvet, then this movie is your cup of tea. If not, don't waste your time, cause you'll hate it, more than likely. 3 1/2 *'s out of 4 *'s."
