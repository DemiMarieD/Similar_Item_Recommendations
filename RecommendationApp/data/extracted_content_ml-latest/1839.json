This movie will not dissappoint. The money driven agent (Billy Crystal) is kicked to the curb by his only client (Chris Makepeace of Meatball fame 1979). Lead by fate to the giant (Gheorge Muresan), Sam brings Max to the states like Carl (Jack Black) brings Kong (Andy Serkis) in the 2005 remake of King Kong. Both Kong and the giant led by misguided unrelenting love, come to the United States seeking neither the fame nor the fortune driving the agent. Like any tragic love-story and somewhat cruel, the world must meet pure love with tragic consequence. Where one couple ends another comes together to find their own lost love. Magic is made here.",

         "I usually don't read others comments before I review a movie, but for this one I did. Mixed feelings by others. Some enjoyed it, some absolutely hated it. Both were right to do so. I liked it. It definitely wasn't a \"great\" movie. I think your reaction to this movie really depends on what you expect going in. It's billed as a comedy, but really it's not very funny so don't expect too much laughter. It is, however, mildly amusing and heart warming. Most importantly, it's clean enough to be an entertaining family movie. Don't expect a deep thought provoker, or a hysterical side splitter, but just watch it. I believe someone else described it as \"predictable fluff\", which is true but that doesn't have to be a bad thing all the time. It's a nice movie so don't end up hating it because you expected too much.",
         "i totally disagree with the person who first commented about this movie. to me, this storyline is about a man with growth hormonal disorder trying his best to look for the love he is yearning for. Trying his very best to fit into the society who doesn't seemed to accept him. He then met someone who treats him with best friend's love and was shown the way to receiving the love he always wanted to have. the man who created all that happiness in returned received something important from the giant, which is family and spouse love. and the comedy, it's just part of making the audience feel some laughter bugs at certain part of the shows. and i must admit, it made me tear a little.",
         "First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving, and even humorous at times. Plus, the location in Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot, was absolutely beautiful. I have to say, this dramatic comedy had me feeling a variety of emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",
         "Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid. The discovery of Billy Crystal's talent scout/agent character in Romania of a giant human is revealing and the behind the scene's view of movie agent is fascinating. Yet the focus remains on sensitive ties of both love and learning about one's self. Eight out of Ten Stars.",
         "This film broke my heart especially when his lost love (played bitchily by Joann Pacula) disses him and actually gets nasty with Billy Crystal who is only trying to help. I thought she would turn out to be a giant herself and that there would be a twist at the end but that was not to be. George Muresan was a little difficult to understand but he brought a warmth to the role. I really enjoyed this heartwarming film and Billy Crystal always makes me laugh. I recommend it highly",
         "I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love. I recommended to you all. It's not the best movie ever, but it was nice!",
         "I'm surprised the ratings for this movie are so low. It's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, don't get me wrong, but it's not a terrible movie either. Billy Crystal plays a talent agent who gets fired by his client then almost drowns. Luckily two giant hands save him from the water, and they are of course attached to the \"giant\", George Muresan (spelling?) who he immediately tries to sign on as a client because there is obvious potential jobs for such a huge man. He brings him to the states under the pretense of reuniting him with the girl he used to like, only she doesn't want to see him at all. The movie has comedy at times but mostly it is a dramatic movie, which it wasn't marketed as, so I think that might be why a lot of people are disappointed. It's not a really deep story and the acting isn't great (Muresan is a basketball player and Billy Crystal is pretty much just going through the motions) but it's definitely worth seeing and is a good little movie.",
         "This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river. Believing he is dead, some huge hands come out to reach him. HE later thinks he is in heaven. He finds out that he isn't, but that he is in a monastery. Believing God saved him, he becomes a monk, searching for who saved him. He later finds a 7 ft 7 in man, who he casts as the perfect villain (he also recites Shakespeare!). See the film and find out the rest!",
         "This is beautiful film making. It did not recieve much publicity, but I found it to be one of the best movies that I had seen that year.*MINOR SPOILERS* Billy Crystal plays Sammy Kamin, a struggling movie producer who travels to Romania and stumbles upon a seven foot tall giant of a man who had saved his life after a car accident. A real life basketball player plays Max (Gheorge Muersan) a kind, gentle loving giant who wants people to respect and care for him. But instead, he is hated by people who feel he is possessed by the Devil because of how quickly he grew as a child. MY GIANT is a touching movie. Comedy beginning and then towards the end, we got into the dramatic moments of the film. Sammy tries numerous ways to make his giant famous, in order to try to score him a role in a movie. But, being famous is not what Max wanted. Steven Segal even plays himself in a ten minute cameo. This movie was great, definetly a winner......5/5.",
         "This movie is supposed to be a comedy, but it isn't funny. When a comedy isn't funny, we know we have a problem. I'm not sure Crystal new exactly what he wanted to do with this movie, whether to tell the story of a failed agent of movie stars (played by himself), criticize the system governing show business, or... In any case, he starts on a couple of these endeavors in this movie, but only barely starts... There is nothing of consequence, the movie just seems to senselessly go from one scene to the next, until it finally reaches the (expected) ending. Nothing tragically bad about this film, but nothing good either."

         "A down-on-his-luck movie agent (Billy Crystal) goes to a movie site in Romania to be with his only client, his former paperboy. But once he gets there, the kid tells him he is getting a big time agent and that he is fired. Despondent, the agent roams the countryside until he loses control of his car and overturns into a pond where he seemingly is going to drown until a pair of gigantic hands pulls him free of the car. Later he awakens in a monastery and discovers that a 7-1/2' man (NBA player Gheorge Muresan) rescued him. Money dances in front of the agent as he figures ways to get him back to America and into the movies. The giant is only interested in getting to Gallup to see his childhood girl friend. First the agent gets him a small role in the Romanian-filmed movie which earns his plane fare. Then he takes him to Las Vegas where he convinces Steven Seagal (in a cameo as himself) to include the giant in a new action film.",
