      "synopsis": "The film opens sometime in the early or late Middle Ages, where Claus is an aging, peasant woodcutter who delivers his gifts with his wife Anya to the children of a certain village. One night, Claus, Anya, and their reindeer, Donner and Blitzen, are rescued from certain death in a blizzard as they are transported to the vast \"ice mountains, way up at the top of the world.\" They find that they were expected, and are accordingly received by a contingent of these same fabled Vendequm, or Elves, led by a wise and venerable old elf named Dooley (John Barrard). They encounter the overzealous elf Patch (Moore), and his trusty companions Boog (Tim Stern), Honka (Peter O'Farrell) and Vout (Christopher Ryan), who soon take charge of the reindeer and sleigh. The kindly couple is then led into the wondrous, wooden elf compound. Dooley soon explains to Claus and Anya that they have been brought here to spend forever crafting and giving a fantastic array of toys to every child on Earth. Preparations for Santa's very first Christmas Eve are made. By suggesting that red should be used for Claus' costume, Patch gets to show that he may be the most inventive elf. Santa's first Christmas Eve begins with our hero, resplendent in his full red-suited regalia, greeted by the Ancient One (Burgess Meredith), the oldest and wisest of all the Elves, who explains to Claus that he and Anya represent the fulfillment of a prophecy that a \"Chosen One\" would be brought into the Elves' world who, \"having no child of his own, would love all children everywhere, and that he himself would be an artisan, and a craftsman, and a skilled maker of toys.\" He charges Santa with his sacred duties and the name by which he will be known throughout the world for all time to come: Santa Claus. Santa then boards his newly recrafted sleigh, while the reindeer are fed with an incredible feed that grants them the power of flight. Santa takes off with a boisterous \"YO!\", signaling the beginning of his legend, which is detailed through a montage of his voyages over the years. The voyages stop in the mid-18th century, first where Mrs. Claus recommends not giving an unruly child a present to punish him for his bad behavior, and then skip ahead to the 19th century, where Dooley is reading the poem, \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" to the elves. This includes a passage that says that Santa's stomach is like a bowl full of jelly, so Santa decides to go on a diet. (It does not last very long.) The film then jumps from the mid-19th century to the late 20th century, until it gets to present-day Manhattan --- where, in a dark and lonely alley, a young orphaned and homeless boy, Joe (Christian Fitzpatrick) struggles to keep himself warm. Across the street, in an elegant townhouse, a young girl named Cornelia (Carrie Kei Heim) suddenly notices the boy before being scolded by her nanny, Miss Tucker (Dorothea Phillips). Back at the North Pole, after Santa tells both Patch and Puffy (Anthony O'Donnell) that he will choose one of them for the newly-created position of Santa's Official Assistant, the two elves compete for the spot. Patch eventually wins out by mass producing toys using his new Patch-o-Matic Supertoy Constructor, as opposed to Puffy, who chooses slower, more traditional methods of hand-crafting. However, unseen by anyone except the viewer, during operation, the machine malfunctions, screwdrivers snap, and the machine creates toys faster and, admittedly, clumsier (indeed, Boog, noticing that the machine may be speeding up too fast, expresses his doubts concerning the situation, to which Patch responds: \"Too fast? Welcome to the 20th century!\"). Later, as Santa takes flight on Christmas Eve, he meets Joe who has been searching for food in the trash. Santa is appalled that such a young child is made to live on his own and offers to take Joe along with him. Joe is realistic, thinking that it is another drunk who got a job as a department store Santa, until Santa has to prove it by transporting him and Joe magically through chimneys. Santa's authenticity gets through to the normally cynical Joe, and the two go for a magical ride in Santa's sleigh. Santa shows Joe all the moves he can do, but falls short of showing him the \"Super Duper Looper,\" as it is too hard for the reindeer. (This sequence eventually inspired executives at New York's Radio City Music Hall to use footage from it to open the venue's annual Christmas Spectacular.) However, on Christmas morning many children find that their toys from Santa made by Patch's Supertoy Constructor prove defective. Ashamed in the company of his fellow elves, blinded by his own distrust of Santa, Patch leaves the North Pole, determined to prove himself to Santa. Puffy is then appointed Santa's Official Assistant. Eventually, Patch meets up with B.Z. (John Lithgow), a businessman who is under investigation by the United States Senate for shoddy manufacturing processing at his toy company; later, Patch also meets B.Z.'s Head of Research and Development, Dr. Eric Towzer (Jeffrey Kramer), along with their chauffeur, Grizzard (John Hallam), and B.Z.'s secretary, Ms. Abruzzi (Judith Morse). Patch passes by a toy store where B.Z.'s toys are being recalled and mistakingly thinks the toys must be unable to stay on the shelves as they must be selling like hotcakes. B.Z. convinces Patch to work with him and B.Z. airs a television commercial that is broadcast on every major television network on Earth. Among those watching the commercial are Joe, Cornelia (B.Z.'s step-niece) and Santa himself. Patch eventually takes flight on Christmas Eve just like Santa, in his own vehicle called the \"Patchmobile\" (which is fueled by reindeer dust and looks like a dozen toys put together), as he drops his own lollipops to all the houses on Santa's route. Patch's outing turns out to be a large success, with his worldwide popularity now rivaling that of Santa's, a fact which Santa is quick to note as he drops off presents to households that already have Patch's lollipops. His well-received lollipops result in B.Z. making Patch exclusive to his company at a press conference. After this success, the ever-reluctant Patch considers himself ready to return to the North Pole, but after revealing to B.Z. that the magic lollipops can make children fly, B.Z. is quick to capitalize on this and suggests using the same magic for candy canes in an effort he plans to market as \"Christmas II.\" Joe and Cornelia catch wind of the plan from B.Z. and Towzer a few nights later, resulting in Joe being captured by Grizzard and taken to B.Z.'s factory. Towzer then reveals that the candy canes in production overreact when exposed to extreme heat, rendering them volatile. B.Z. dismisses this news as a reckless afterthought, and proposes to Towzer that the two of them escape to Brazil, which has no extradition treaty with the United States, thus leaving Patch to take the blame for all the possible chaos. The next morning, Cornelia writes to Santa about Joe's capture; once he learns of this, Santa wastes little time in taking off for Cornelia's place, regardless of the fact that he must make do with only six reindeer, as a result of Comet and Cupid both having come down with the flu. Cornelia tells Santa that she contacted the police about Joe's kidnapping, but doubts she was taken seriously. Back at B.Z.'s factory, Patch rescues the captured Joe. Though Joe is initially angry at Patch for ruining Christmas, Patch discovers that Joe is carrying a wooden likeness of Patch crafted by Santa, suggesting to Patch that Santa might like him after all. The two now resolve to deliver all the candy canes to Santa as a present in the Patchmobile, unaware of the canes' lethal side effects. At the same time, B.Z. finds himself surrounded by the New York City Police Department, in response to Cornelia having called them, which they did indeed take seriously. The NYPD, already having apprehended and handcuffed Grizzard and Towzer, yells to B.Z. via a bullhorn that they they know that he's up there, and he is to surrender or they will enter his office. As the policemen are on their way up to his office, B.Z. eats an entire handful of the magic candy canes --- only to find himself floating higher and higher, disappearing into the stratosphere. Meanwhile, Patch and Joe continue on their journey, until they find themselves in need of rescue, as the Patchmobile's continuing speed causes the candy canes to heat up, in turn causing certain unprotected wiring to violently self-activate. Santa, in pursuit, manages to rescue them from the exploding Patchmobile after a tense moment where ultimately, he must execute the one move he has never been able to properly execute: the \"Super Duper Looper.\" The film ends with a joyous celebration with Santa, Anya and the other elves .... and it seems that Cornelia and Joe will stay with Santa at the North Pole. The final scene ends with B.Z. suspended in space along with the remnants of the Patchmobile, floating higher and yelling for help. (Source: WikiPedia. Posted By Candy_Cane_Sprinkles)",

         "I don't care who you are, this movie is a fun and magical experience for all ages. The actors are superb in their roles and their songs and characters will win your heart. This movie may have been filmed almost 20 years ago but it still carries the message today that it did then. That Christmas should be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of creed, colour or persuasion. I defy anyone, who actually HAS a heart, not to like this movie. I first saw it when I was 3 years old and to this day, I have watched it every year thereafter on Christmas eve. To me, this film holds the very feeling of Christmas. All you need do is watch it. And no matter where you are, no matter what time of year it is, from start to finish... it's Christmas.",
         "Me thinks folks protest too much! Sit back, relax and enjoy this cute little movie. The plot is good. The actors do a very nice job of \"being\" their characters. Villains are vile and heroes are worthy. There is a continual ebb and flow with who is winning, good or evil. Good wins over evil. The scenery is is beautiful and fanciful. The effects are nifty and somewhat corny. What more could one ask for a short period of fantasy flight from the cares of the world? Don't worry about fitting it into today's \"problems with society section.\" Avoid seeing discussions of drug problems, violence in the world, sex in the city. Don't consider deep, hidden meanings. Just have some popcorn, turn down the lights, get into your comfy chair and enjoy yourself. This is a movie made for the cold winter nights.",
         "I have long lasting memories of this film from when I was very small. It was on the television every Christmas, and my sister and I loved. At one point we actually taped it and watched it again and again and again. In fact, most of my generation loved it. OK, so it is badly done, and the plot is predictable and a bit thin, but remember it is designed for kids and was made in the early 80's. A grown adult watching it for the first time would hate it and think it is just a pile of rubbish, that is how I feel about Barbie & the Nutcracker Prince, but kids seeing that when it first came out loved it!!",
         "While this movie admittedly has its detractors I personally am NOT one of them. It's utterly charming. Among it's strengths-it's perfectly cast, all the way from Dudley Moore on down to the extras. The sets are breathtaking, and the music is engaging (including Sheena Easton's beautiful \"Christmas All Over the World\"). With all this movie has going for it it does have its drawbacks. The first half definitely works better than the latter. It seems almost as if they were trying to make 2 movies for the price of 1, and that does detract from the overall effect. It gets a bit confusing once it hits the half-way point but it is still worth seeing all the way through. It's the sort of movie that can still hold up after repeated viewings. You can watch it with your kids, or make a guilty pleasure out of watching it by yourself. Either way do yourself a favor and watch it.",
         "I have seen this movie every Christmas since I was a child, and I believe it brings explanations of how the fable of Santa Claus, and all of the childhood beliefs came to be. It may be a watered down version of Willy Wonka, but it had great effects for the 1980's, and it brings out the child and Christmas spirit in everyone. It is a grade above Ernest Saves Christmas ( I love watching it as well on a comical basis) especially when it comes to the story line and characters. Dudley Moore was wonderful as Patch the elf, and delivered a great performance without being a drunk or married to two women. It's movie of morals, and the spirit of Christmas.",
         "Santa Claus the movie is without a doubt the greatest Christmas movie ever made. This is not to say that its story is one of the greatest ever written, but the film is a stunning piece of seasonal and magical nostalgia for anyone who is enchanted by the its seasonal charm. David Newman has taken a great deal of criticism for his writing styles. Well, whatever the merits of Newman, he proves with Santa Claus that he CAN write an exciting and entertaining epic for the big screen. His script does have flaws and plot holes, but this could be due to editing of post production. Newman comes up with a lovely entertaining script that doesn't sag once throughout. This is expertly handled by Jeanot Swarzc's luxurious direction. Swarzc lets the actors indulge in what is a Hollywood pantomime. Add to this the movie is backed by one of the most impressive sets for any movie, a wonderful Lapland/Northpole, covered in endless snow, a terrific looking Santa's workshop, some of the greatest costumes ever created for Santa and his friends by the master Bob Ringwood, and finally a wonderful Christmas Time New York. In typical Alexander Salkind style, this all gells together marvellously to bring to us what childhood dreams are made of. The movie is Dudley Moores as the hero elf Patch. Moore gets to kid about to his hearts consent, and get payed [$4MILLION] for the pleasure. His enthusiasm rubs off on the other cast members, in particular John Lithgow as the evil BZ. A few years earlier BZ could easily have been played by Peter Sellers, today perhaps Rowan Atkinson. For what it is worth Lithgow is hillarious in the role, he is very covincing as a real life scrooge. Plus David Huddleston as Santa. An inspired a choice as Christopher Reeve was as Superman, Huddleston is the ULTIMATE personification of Santa. He is how we remeber him. He even sounds like him. In truth he makes us BELIEVE him. With all this plus Magic candy, Wonderfull scenery, Top notch acting. Plus the best Flying scenes in motion picture history of Santas reindeers, and patching cars, wich prove to be better than the Salkinds earlier Superman effects, and also Henry Mancini's best ever musical score, a heart warming piece abetted by some good songs from the likes of Leslie Bricuse sung by Sheena Easton,. Santa Cluas IS underated. Have a heart when you watch this movie. Put on Your seatbelt and join Santa in dreamworld. Thanks to Alexander and Ilya Salkind, Piere Spengler, Jeannot Swarzc and Dudley Moore.",
         "I can not remember what age I was when I first seen this movie. But I do remember that it used to be played on Irish TV every year on Christmas eve.My best memory from childhood was sitting by the coal fire to let my hair dry and watching this movie. My favorite part was always when Joe shouts Yo and the raindeer take flight! It still makes me shiver. I am now 24 and only wish I could get it on DVD here in the UK so I could play it on a regional 2 player. I have a baby on the way and I would love someday for my children to enjoy the wonder of Santa Claus the movie as I did all those years ago. This film gave me a lot of happy Christmas' Dx",
         "Personally, I love this film! I've gone out of my way to buy myself acopy from America (as its not being produced anymore) I think its a lovely film for kids and adults of all ages. I watch it every year on christmas eve. The story is simple and easy to follow, no complicated names/locations, just a good film! Get yourself a copy. I know eBay regularly stock it! One to watch 10/10 Matt",
         "This is a fun movie for the whole family. It is truly the legend of Santa Claus come to life. One of the must see movies for my whole family every Holiday season. Dudley Moore, John Lithgow and David Huddleston are perfect in their respective roles.",
         "Under-rated little family film that works due to a couple of over-the-top performances more than anything else. We get a glimpse into the history of the titled character (played by David Huddleston) and his wife (Judy Cornwell) as they make the North Pole their home. Years and years pass and we get to the present-day, but trouble looms as the toys manufactured by elf Dudley Moore (in a wonderful performance) start to fall apart on all the children of the world. Moore feels shame and decides that it would be better to leave. Thus he falls in with evil toy manufacturer John Lithgow (in another fine role) and this is when the fun really starts. Burgess Meredith also has a short, endearing cameo. A production that is tame enough for young children, but is also interesting enough to keep the adults happy as well. Good overall. 4 stars out of 5."
