         "I gave this movie 3 stars because my (very young) kids seemed to enjoy it, but I really cannot understand how anyone could compare this favorably to Babe the Pig. Babe is a sensitive, entertaining, and even intelligent movie. Gordy is nothing like it. Gordy is cheap, boring, and insulting to anyone with a modicum of intelligence. The acting is poor, the writing predictable, and the hairstyles drove me crazy. It really looked like it was made in 1985 instead of 1995. In contrast, Babe has such a timeless quality about it. My kids don't really like Babe, I assume, because it goes at a slower pace and is not so flashy, but I'm sure that once they are older, they will enjoy it much more than Gordy. Gordy just has no substance. If you are looking for something that you can enjoy with your children, this is not it!",
         "While visiting family with my four year old daughter we found a video of \"Gordy\" and put it on for her. She loves movies, but after about a half-hour she turned to me and said \"I don't like this pig movie\". She loves \"Babe\". It's nice to know she has some taste. The only thing remotely good about this film is Kristy Young, the little girl C&W singer, and the trained piglet seemed like a pretty good swimmer. In the half-hour we watched, the animals never looked like they were talking, the plot was completely uninvolving, and the acting was mediocre at best. One nice thing was finding out the reason that Tom Lester (Eb from \"Green Acres\") never got anywhere with his career. He's a one-note performer. At least Eb had some decent writers. Now my daughter is happily watching \"The Aristocats\".",
         "I sat down with my just turned 5 year old for \"Family Movie Night\" and we let him pick this off the free video on demand. Sure the kid loved it, but words cannot describe how awful this movie is. I would rather saw off my head with an electric toothbrush (modified of course) than to watch this movie again. There are so many parts of this movie that are just completely unbelievable, it makes you want to cry (Ignore the fact that the pig talks and humans can understand him....that's the most believable thing in the movie). During one scene, the kid and pig are walking down the road lost when all of the sudden the only people in the entire country that know them pass by them in their RV. Granted this is just some country road and the people in the RV are traveling all over the country singing. Another scene has the bad guys throwing a pig off a couple hundred feet bridge where Cousin Idiot is able to catch the pig in his arms down below without the other people noticing. The wealthy businessman dies and leaves his company to his young grandson. However, because his grandson is too young to run the company, he gives complete control to Gordy. Gordy is a f'ing pig mind you. The pig is then shown interviewed numerous times on stock market / business type shows where the host asks him a question and the pig snorts a few times in response. The entire plot seems like it was generated by some drawing board created by a 3 year old. I cannot imagine how this actually got funding to produce or how badly an actor needed a job to look at this script and say \"Hell yes, sign me up.\"",
         "The opening of the movie was kinda boring, so I thought it would be not so good at first, but in the end, it was really funny. I rated this 6/10 about 40 minutes after watching the beginning of the movie because it was getting funnier, but when it got to where Gordy fell in the swimming pool, I decided to change it to an 8/10. When Gordy fell in a swimming pool to save a little boy, I literally laughed my butt off watching Gordy swim. That was the funniest scene I ever saw in this movie. Gordy's voice kinds reminds me of Andy Barclay from Child's Play and Child's Play 2. Gordy's a brave piglet who saved his family from a slaugther house, most piglets would be scared of one. If you're gonna call anything a ripoff, it'd be Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale (It was so unspeakably awful, I couldn't last 3 minutes after it. It's a hobo's version of Gordy) or one of South Park's top 10 worst episodes where they ripped off the whole plot by making 4 retarded idiots with annoying voices saving baby cows from a slaugther house (That too, is a hobo's Gordy).",
         "After reading such negative reviews on here, I just had to step in and write a review! Gordy came out when I was 6, so it was prime time for me. Gordy became one of my favorite movies, along with \"The Road To El Dorado\" and \"The Lion King\" and many more. Granted \"Babe\" was a big hit and a family favorite for many, I would say Gordy is just as good, if not better than Babe. I admit it may be corny to those older than 10, but it definitely a good choice for a young one. The actors are a little cheesy, but the talking animals are too cute. The plot is interesting as the main character, Gordy, is trying to save his family, so of course the story is good for little ones to learn family values.",
         "This movie is PERFECT for watching with the whole family! My 3 year old was laughing out loud the WHOLE time!!! My 12 year old loved it just as much as we did. The plot was simple, so that small children could easily follow along with it. Doug Stone as the father was perfect! I can't say enough good things about this movie! And since there is a 10 line min, apparently I'm going to have to find things to say about it. omg I'like feeling dizzy, sorry ya'll but I took a pain pill for an abcessed tooth, and feeling a little light headed. And STILL it won't let me post this comment, Um..it was a cute movie, honestly. Made me chuckle all 12 thousand times I had to watch it.",
         "I love this film. An adventure takes place from a country farm where Gordy's father taken away up North and later learned that his family joined, he tries to find them. The pig makes friends with a daughter of a country music singer (Kristy Young), which country music singer Doug Stone plays her father. Later they make friends with a wealthy family which Gordy saves a wealthy son from the pool. That's a fun movie to watch. Plus country music singers like Christy Lane, Moe Brandy, Roy Clark, and Tom Lester of \"Green Acres\" fame appears in this movie as well. I give it 10 out of 10.",
         "This is truly an amazing movie. I KNOW so. Why can't they make more movies like this great gem instead of crap like The Oogieloves and The Boxtrolls? How can you people rate this marvelous masterpiece a 3.8 when The Effing Oogieloves got a 7.3? This belongs in the Top 250! It belongs with The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption in the Top TEN of the Top 250! You 204 people who gave Gordy a 1/10 rating need new lives! I bet it's the same people who love Sanjay and Craig, Marvin Marvin, and Breadwinners! Or even the same people who hate Liv and Maddie! Have you noticed that? This movie is a lot like Liv and Maddie with it's great focus on family and friendship being more important than fame and fortune! And that very focus on family and friendship also makes it a lot like Lady and the Tramp! We need more movies like this! We really do! The closest thing we got to this in a LONG TIME was last year when we got Frozen! You KNOW this movie is great when at least two people I know like it even better than Frozen! It's true. Grandma and dad both thought that! And it's actually three because I have a friend named Aston who liked it more than Frozen AND Babe! Rating this lower than Breadwinners is no better than The Lion King being rating lower than Toddlers and Tiaras. This movie is wonderful and whoever says otherwise is an absolute idiot!",
         "The talking pig who made it big has got people here folks! He's just your average adorable little piglet, from a typical farm family. That is, until his family has been taken away! Now he's off on an epic search in the city to find them! Along the way, he makes friends with two kids, and saves one of them from drowning! Gordy becomes famous for his actions of heroism, and becomes the CEO of a business! Eventually, with all the fame Gordy has attracted, he gets his own stamp! Meanwhile, an unscrupulous business man tries to take on Gordy and get rid of him! His henchman are told to kidnap him, tie him in a sack, and toss him in the river! But with the help of his new friends, they all figure out where his family's been taken to (a slaughterhouse in Omaha). They go there and successfully shut the sinister slaughterhouse down once and for all! And in the end, Gordy and his friends and family all get to live together on the farm forever! This seems to be a love-it or hate-it type movie. But I loved it! A sweet story, cute characters, and a precious piglet! This is the most underrated movie ever! It's beautiful and proves that no matter how small you may be, you can always make a difference! And it's NOT a rip-off of Babe. They are just as good and just happen to share some similarities. UPDATE ON September 17: Actually, Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale is not a hobo's version of Gordy. It is an in name only mockbuster of Charlotte's Web which just so happened to be released three weeks and three days before the live-action version came out. So, what did they do? That's right, they copied the original animated masterpiece from 1973. Very loosely that is. Hence it's an in name only mockbuster. Also, I never knew South Park ripped off Gordy. And I already hate that show just like you do, for pretty much the same reasons. Look at my list entitled \"The most overrated shows and movies ever\" and you'll see my reasons why. And as far as I'm concerned, the real reason Gordy's a great gem of a movie is not because it's funny (although that contributes). No, the real reason it's wonderful is because of its heartwarming story (which is NOT charmless, it's adorable), its lovable characters (come on, you know Gordy's adorable), its wonderful moral messages (I've already touched on this in this review and the one on my other account), and it's just plain entertaining, wholesome family fun. I know a lot of people say it's too dark with the slaughterhouse, but what about Bambi? Or The Lion King? They both feature the death of the most important parent (in Bambi it's the mother, in Lion King it's Simba's father Mufasa). At least Gordy's parents don't die. This is actually one of the few Disney movies where the parents live. Which makes it a lot like Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan, Tangled, and Mulan. Also, Sleeping Beauty was dark too. And then there's people think this is rip-off of Babe, um, no it's not. Babe's not about a pig having to save his family, Gordy's not about a pig aspiring to become a sheepdog. They're different plots people! Plus Sleeping Beauty was A LOT like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, does that make it a rip-off too? And I already mentioned one reason why Lion King and Bambi are alike, but there's more. They both have the Circle of Life theme, they both have the protagonist as next in-line for the throne, they both have the antagonist kill the important parent, there's a fire in both movies, the hyenas assist Scar the same way Man is assisted by hunting dogs, they both have the protagonist fall in love with his childhood best friend, they both have epic battles (like when Scar fights Simba and Bambi fights Ronno), and they even both have the book ends trope! So yeah, you see what I mean? And yet NO ONE has accused Lion King as being a Bambi rip-off. Not that that's what I'm saying, but I'm saying they're more similar plot-wise than this is to Babe. And come on, even shows like Shake it Up and Dog with a Blog have higher ratings than Gordy. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER! I already wrote a review of Dog with a Blog explaining why it's awful and SHOULD have been canceled after the first season like Marvin Marvin. But no, they just HAD to renew it for a season season AND a third. It better not last longer than four seasons! If Gordy was a TV show I bet it'd be rated just as high as Regular Show. OK, I'm done with this before I exceed the 1,000 word limit.",
         "If you're looking for a very well done, deep movie, I would recommend you to look elsewhere. I became curious about the movie when my family and I were headed to our vacation to Charleston, SC. This was just shortly before it came out in theaters; the pig playing Gordy was visiting North Carolina (Statesville, I believe) where we stayed overnight. I wanted to see him but the travelling schedule didn't allow it. I was given Gordy on VHS for Christmas '95 and I've only watched it one other time since. The acting isn't anything to write for nor are the effects for the pig's talking. I have to say though, I thought it was neat seeing a pig swim."
