         "Buster Keaton, a businessman who is about to get into some serious trouble and lose all his money, finds out his fortunes might change rapidly as a relative dies and leaves him $7 million. One hitch: he has to be married by his 27th birthday to qualify for the cash....and - surprise - today is his 27th birthday. Well, he frantically searches for anyone to marry him, starting with his girlfriend and then working down to others. He has a list of seven women - all very pretty, I might add, even with that stupid 1920s overdone makeup. Poor Buster quickly strikes out on all seven of those. Then - and here is where the real fun starts - his business partner puts a story in that day's newspaper saying his buddy is looking to marry a woman and collect $7 million. All you have to do is meet him at the church at 5 o'clock to marry him. Well, hundreds - maybe a thousand - women all storm the church! When Buster sees this - and then gets a note from his girlfriend saying she WILL marry him - he escapes from the church to meet her. Unfortunately, the chase is on as the multitude of women chase him all over town. The hordes of women pursue him the main street, through a railroad yard, past the suburbs and finally into the countryside where he loses them. He still isn't home free as giant boulders start chasing him down a hill and then chase him for miles. Keaton keeps running and running through all of it. He has more endurance than an Olympic marathon runner! It's touch-and-go whether he can make it to see his girl by the 7 p.m. deadline and get married. All of this takes place in a 56-minute film with the last 15 minutes being total insanity with that great chase scene. Silent movie comedy entertainment.does not get much better than this.",
         "Contrary to what you may have read, \"Seven Chances\" (1925) was made before Buster Keaton signed with MGM and relinquished artistic control over his own films. His gifts of extraordinary agility, timing, and visualizing the comic potential in the most mundane situations are everywhere in evidence. The plot of \"Seven Chances\" is ancient. A young bachelor stands to inherit millions if he can find a bride by a certain day and marry at a certain hour. The date is invariably the same as the day the will is read, and in the hands of Keaton, his writers and cast, the comic possibilities are brilliantly exploited. The same premise was the basis for at least three other films before Keaton's, and was remade (abysmally -- from what I've read) as \"The Bachelor\" with Chris O'Donnell in 1999. The chain of events that flows from news of the inheritance just builds and builds over the course of the film, the gags growing increasingly clever as time grows shorter. \"Seven Chances\" clocks in at less than an hour, but the final 15 minutes (which Buster Keaton reportedly reworked several times) are among the most hilarious in all of silent film, perhaps in the history of screen comedy. Initially, only Buster, his business partner (T. Ray Brown) and the lawyer (Snitz Edwards, who was so terribly homely he was cute) are aware of the dilemma. After Buster botches a proposal to his longtime girlfriend, (Ruth Dwyer), he pops the question to several more female acquaintances, with predictably embarrassing results. It is then that Brown and Edwards (unbeknownst to Buster) decide to place a newspaper announcement advertising his plight. Once the newspapers hit the streets, the chase is on. Keaton is pursued through 1920s Los Angeles by dozens, then scores, then seemingly hundreds of would-be brides. They come in all ages, shapes and sizes, makeshift veils trailing after them. No obstacle is too great in their pursuit to beat out each other for the prize of marriage to a man they don't even know, and Buster throws out plenty of roadblocks in his wake. In 1979, Walter Kerr wrote the definitive book on silent comedies, \"The Silent Clowns.\" One of the jacket blurbs reads, \"I found myself laughing out loud at routines from movies I have never seen.\" I don't have Kerr's gift, but I can tell you that \"Seven Chances\" is the most consistently funny movie Buster Keaton ever made. All of his movies include inventive sight gags, but \"Seven Chances,\" more than most of Buster's movies, relies on character comedy as well as situational comedy for its humor. And it scores a bull's eye on both. A sheer delight.",
         "This film might seem familiar, as it has been remade several times--the last time just a few years ago. Buster Keaton stands to inherit a fortune providing he marries before time expires. But, he has no prospects and time is running out--what to do, what to do? Well, he tries again and again and again with no luck. That is until the ladies find out about the fortune that awaits them as his bride. Then, EVERYONE under the sun comes out of the woodwork--all ages, races and sizes. And, because so much money is involved, it goes from being a cute comedy to complete pandemonium! These women WON'T take no for an answer and they are super-dooper aggressive--and Buster runs for his life! Well, the ladies aren't about to let their fortune get away and hundreds of maniacal brides-to-be (all in white) give chase--resulting in one of the funniest chases in film history. What happens next is for you to see for yourself. It's funny, well-made and fast paced fun.",
         "Buster Keaton's comic genius makes \"Seven Chances\" a wildly entertaining film. The first half of it is quite good, if imperfect, but the second half is a tour-de-force of sustained humor and creativity. Keaton plays Jimmie Shannon, a young man who learns that he stands to inherit a fortune, but only if he marries by 7 PM that very day. It's the kind of goofy premise that in lesser hands could be a complete flop, but Keaton gets all kinds of possibilities out of it. For most of the first half of the film, Jimmie is busy racing around proposing to every woman he can find. His true love, Mary, tries to find Jimmie herself, but he is already off on his frantic search for someone to accompany him to the altar. The search is always funny, at times extremely so. This first half has a handful of things that don't quite work, such as the black-faced servant (who was, though, probably intended as a sympathetic character), but if it were not for that and a couple other small details, this would be a nearly perfect film. In the second half, all of the complications set up a frantic chase sequence, with literally hundreds (at least) of angry women pursuing Jimmie through the city, while he tries to get to Mary. This might be the best comic chase sequence ever filmed. It is hilarious and incredibly inventive, with careful choreography, a great variety of backgrounds, and a huge collection of gags both obvious and subtle. No description could do it justice - it has to be seen at least once to appreciate it. If you are a fan of Keaton or of silent films in general, make sure to see this one.",
         "This is one of Keaton's absolute best comedies and a superb example of clever invention -in narrative, in gag development, and in the use of composition and editing to achieve comedic effects. Among the unforgettable moments are: The trip from the country club to his sweetheart's home and back by hopping in a car and letting the backgrounds dissolve. The marriage proposal response from the balcony of the country club. The stairway proposal - one going up and one coming down. The hatcheck girl's response to her proposal. Jean Arthur's bit part as \"Miss Smith.\" The proposal while driving and the resultant encounter with a tree. The ethnic mistake. The barber with the dummy heads. The Julian Eltinge error. The race of expectant brides to reach the church. The clocks in a shop window of different times. The ladies' absorption of the bricks. The football field invasion. The turtle on Buster's tie. The entire twenty minute concluding chase, especially with the onslaught of the rocks. Kino's print is the best of all the Keaton films they have released-crisp, clear, sharp and flawless. This Metro-Goldwyn feature only lasts for 56 minutes but it seems to whiz by in even shorter time than that. The score is one for violin,piano and drums. Although much is made of the short opening two-strip Technicolor scenes- four of them - in this print it is a red wash- no color at all. The rest of the film is beautifully tinted. Don't miss this one - a great great comedy.",
         "Buster Keaton catapults himself down a steep hillside, an avalanche of pebbles, rocks and boulders tumbling in his wake. If any one of these objects were to strike him down, he would certainly be killed by the impact. He is almost escaping the rocks now; just a few more seconds of frantic sprinting is required. Suddenly, Keaton looks up, only to find a massive horde of woman striding purposefully towards him. He is stuck between a rock and a hard place: an avalanche behind him, and a flock of would-be brides ahead. Quickly and delicately weighing his chances of survival either way, Keaton turns determinedly towards the barrage of boulders. It is hilarious little moments like this that make Buster Keaton's silent comedies such a joy to watch, and 'Seven Chances' is certainly one of the funniest I've seen, brimming with the talented actor's trademark deadpan humour. The premise on which the story is based is singularly ridiculous, and so this allows Keaton to have a great deal of fun, placing his character in appropriately bizarre situations. Young Jimmy Shannon (Keaton) loves his sweetheart Mary Jones (Ruth Dwyer), but can never quite muster up the courage to tell her, and most certainly could never take that plunge into marriage. However, one day he discovers that his grandfather has left him the princely sum of $7 million, but only if he gets married\u0085 by 7 PM that day! After he is rejected by Mary (due to an unfortunate misunderstanding), Jimmy seeks out another would-be bride, ultimately realising that finding a wife isn't as easy as he had hoped. The first half of the film is admittedly light on Keaton's patented stunt-work, but it remains a clever and witty situation comedy, with poor Jimmy suffering the laughter of onlookers as he moves from one girl to the next, tentatively asking for their hands in marriage. When all this fails, an advertisement in the afternoon-edition newspaper brings hundreds of women to Jimmy's side, but by now he's realised that Mary is the only girl he could ever marry. As he struggles desperately to get to her home by 7:00, he is pursued by a horde of money-crazy ladies: big and small, young and old, beautiful and ugly. This is truly where Keaton comes into his element, and a hectic scramble down a hillside \u0096 pursued by an avalanche of rocks \u0096 is the film's most memorable moment {the idea for this scene came by accident, when Keaton inadvertently dislodged some rocks while he was running. The preview audience responded so favourably that he decided to re-shoot an extended sequence}. The paper-mâché rocks look quite convincing, and I was pretty much fooled into thinking that Keaten was really dodging the real thing (until I noticed him get bowled over by one of the boulders, without any apparent ill-effects!) 'Seven Chances' moves by at such a frenetic pace that there isn't a moment that could be trimmed. Though it runs for just 56 minutes, I had a huge smile on my face for every single one of them.",
         "Seven Chances is one of Buster Keaton's comedic masterpieces from the mid-1920's. It has been beautifully restored by Kino for both the VHS and DVD versions, with a lovely compilation of an attractive musical score by Robert Israel; a technicolor beginning, and tints. A most enjoyable film, and worth every dime if you buy it. Look for a young, pert Jean Arthur in a bit part as the secretary, without her customary blond curls. Jimmie (Buster Keaton) is a young stockbroker who has gotten into financial difficulties with his partner Billy. When Jimmie learns a rich grandfather has died and left him 7 million dollars in his will it looks like Jimmie's troubles may be over. But there is a catch: Jimmie must marry by 7pm on the evening of his 27th birthday, which is the same day he is notified of the possible windfall. He asks his girlfriend Mary to marry him, and she says yes, but then he bungles the proposal when he tells her the reason why he must marry her \"today\". No girl likes to think she is being married just to obtain a fortune, and Mary spurns Jimmie. This leads to Jimmie's partner Billy convincing him he must marry \"some girl\", since he owes it to their friendship and partnership to obtain the money to salvage their business. The madness then ensues, where Jimmie proposes to every female in sight, including famous female impersonator Julian Eltinge. The second half of the film is Buster's brainchild entirely, and will have you laughing non-stop, as Jimmie escapes the wrath of an entire city of thwarted brides, who all wanted a shot at his 7 million and were denied. The most famous shots are the running-down-the-mountains-with-the-boulders-chasing-you scenes, invented by Buster, but there are many other deliciously funny moments as well, and a suitable, happy ending, complete with a Dalmation's kisses. See Seven Chances before you pass on. You owe it to yourself. :) One final note: a previous commentator here wrote that Buster did not care for his Seven Chances. That is not quite true. The business situation surrounding the planning of the film did not suit him, since the vehicle was chosen for him by Joseph Schenck, and he preferred to do his own material, but Buster did have creative control over the 2nd half of the film, and it shows. When the film was restored and re-shown starting in the 1960's, before his death, Buster Keaton was able to realize how much of a crowd pleaser this film was, and he changed his mind about it. If you are a student of the 1920's and love comedy, you will find lots to love in Seven Chances. It's sweet.",
         "I had never seen a Buster Keaton movie before this one; now, I only wish I hadn't missed so much of the local Keaton film fest. This film was unlike anything I'd ever seen before -- a jaw-dropping of hilarity and acrobatic skill. You want to sit there, stunned at the stunts Buster pulls, but it's so hilarious, you absolutely can't stop laughing. It's simply a good movie for about 45 minutes; then, the last 15 are incomparable.",
         "I love Seven Chances as much if not more than any of Keaton's other features, even if it does not enjoy the same reputation as The General or Sherlock, Jr. Using the sure-fire concept of a man who must take a wife or lose a fortune, Buster builds and executes one of his greatest extended gag sequences -- the chase of the reluctant groom by the army of brides. The first sections of the film detail Buster's inability to get anyone to take his proposal of marriage seriously, and then Buster pulls out all the stops on the famine to feast prospect once scores of women of all shapes and sizes begin to hunt down our hero while dressed in their wedding gowns. Seven Chances completely capitalizes on its comic potential, and Buster offers up another unbelievable tour de force of superb movie making.",
         "Seven Chances (1925) **** (out of 4) Buster Keaton's greatest comedy is also one of the greatest comedies ever made. This film has huge laughs, one of the greatest chases ever not to mention some of the greatest stunts ever captured on film. In the movie Keaton plays a shy fellow who can't build up the nerve to tell his girlfriend that he loves her. He gets a letter stating that he will inherit seven million dollars if he gets married before seven that evening but there's a mix up between him and the girlfriend but the biggest problem is that every other woman is willing to marry him for the money. I had forgotten what a wonderful gem this film is but I was laughing harder and more often than any other film that comes to my mind. I'm not sure where to start with the laughs because each scene contains one and the majority of the scenes contain multiple laughs. The film's 56-minute running time feels like the matter of seconds because everything is just happening so incredibly fast. There are three great things about this film but I'll start with the laughs. I might go as far as to say that there isn't a joke in the film that doesn't work. The wonderful moments inside the country club where Keaton tries to find a wife, the politically incorrect joke of Keaton accidentally asking a little girl to marry him, the racial joke of Keaton almost asking a black woman to marry him and of course the wonderful gag with the dummy in the barber chair. That's just to name a few because there are at least a hundred other jokes. The second brilliant thing about the film is the fact that Keaton hired hundreds (if not over a thousand) women to chase him when they discover he will inherit millions. The scene inside the church with all these women trying to pile in is just something incredible on the eyes. This stunt leads to the third masterpiece of this film and that's the final twenty minutes where these hundreds of women chase Keaton either trying to marry him or kill him. Anyone who knows anything about Keaton knows that he would put his life at risk to pull off a stunt and there are at least eight different stunts here that could have or even should have killed him. Watching him perform these stunts is truly breathtaking and him running into the barbed wire is also quite painful. Oh yeah, Snitz Edwards is brilliant as the lawyer and you've also got Jean Arthur in an early performance. Certainly one of the all time greats."
