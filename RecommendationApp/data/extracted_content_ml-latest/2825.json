She lives with Irene, who's 27, whom Rosie knows is in fact her mother, but that's their secret. Irene's brother Michel, unemployed, a compulsive gambler, comes to stay with them. Around then, Irene meets Bernard; they come to care for each other. This leaves Rosie without attention, so she puts all her adolescent hopes and romantic fantasies into a relationship with Jimi, a good looking kid she sees on a bus. Is it adventures with Jimi that land her in juvie? Once she's there, why doesn't he answer her letters?",

         "\"Rosie\" is riveting... a very bleak, very disturbing coming-of-age story... the kind of movie that wouldn't get made in Hollywood in a million years... It's about a thirteen year old girl's relationship with her mother... about how that relationship is affected by the men in her mother's life... that's just the tip of the iceberg... to say more would spoil the twists and turns that await the unsuspecting viewer... I've seen a lot of movies this year, and this is one of the very best... see it if you get the chance...",
         "Coming of age films set in middle-class environments can be illuminating, but throw into the mix a mother who became pregnant at 14, an unemployed resident uncle who is also a gambling addict, and a mysteriously handsome boyfriend, and you have the ingredients for an utterly convincing and riveting film which reveals more and more of the central character's situation as the film progresses. These revelations are drip fed at regular intervals, and lead to a dramatic closing scene. The small cast of actors is excellent, but perhaps it is the setting which gives this film such a hold on the audience. Basically, there are only two 'sets'. The first is the claustrophobic apartment, where a harassed mother attempts to maintain some sense of civilised living - like everyone sitting down at table for proper meals - but where pressures arise from the three residents living in too close proximity. The second is the bleak landscape of Antwerp's outer semi-industrial suburbs, where mysterious bits of machinery litter a bleak landscape of bare fields and anonymous tower blocks - a perfect setting for a young girl to live out adolescent fantasies. This is an excellent film - highly recommended."
