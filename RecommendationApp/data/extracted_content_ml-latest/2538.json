         "A stirring portrait of an American dancer and choreographer. This film gives an all-round characterization of the dance world. It shows dance as ennobling, artistic, competitive and gruelling. Mr. Taylor emerges as highly motivated, articulate and expects much dedication from his dancers. His choreography is highly creative. This film provides a short history of Mr. Taylor with some of his early performances. I recently saw a performance of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and was highly impressed. The diversity of his dance shows was innovative and intriguing. This is well illustrated in the film where we are treated to a wide range of dance sequences, style and music. If you like dance this is a must viewing for you. It also shows the dance company on tour and performing briefly in India.",
         "Suffice to say a great movie, entertaining and compelling. However, any student of dance should always keep keep this in the back pocket if he or she is thinking of making dancing a profession. A really hard life this is, the dancer."
