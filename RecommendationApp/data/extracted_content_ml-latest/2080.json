      "synopsis": "In a small turn-of-the-century town, a couple designated by the names 'Jim Dear' and 'Darling' are celebrating Christmas. Darling is overjoyed to receive a Cocker Spaniel puppy, whom she names Lady. Time passes, and Lady is well-taken care of by her owners, who delight in her company. At 6 months, she is given a collar with a license. Lady then goes to visit two neighboring dogs, Jacques and Trusty. Jacques is a wily Scottish Terrier, and Trusty is an old Bloodhound. The two compliment Lady on her new license, before Lady rushes off to greet Jim Dear, who has come home from work. Time passes on, and one day, Jacques and Trusty come to visit Lady, and find her feeling depressed. Lady explains that something seems to have happened to Jim Dear and Darling. She then explains how one day after coming home, Jim Dear referred to her as 'that dog.' Another time, she tried to playfully take a ball of yarn from Darling, who then struck Lady. Jacques and Trusty soon explain to Lady, that her owners are expecting a baby. Lady is unsure what a baby is, but the two explain what they know. However, their speech is soon interrupted by a mangy grey dog named Tramp. Tramp then explains that babies are 'homewreckers,' and that Lady can expect to be lectured frequently, and sent to the doghouse in the yard. Jacques angrily orders Tramp to leave, but Tramp just smiles, as if he knows the truth to the whole thing. Time passes, and lady observes all manner of changes, from strange people entering the house, to Jim Dear leaving early in the morning to get something for Darling. Finally, the baby arrives, and Lady feels even more alone, as her owners spend all their time with 'it.' One day, out of curiosity, Lady goes into the new nursery, where Jim Dear and Darling show her the new baby. Lady is intrigued by the little baby boy, and her owners give her some reassuring pats on her head, signs that they still love her as well. Sometime afterward, Jim Dear and Darling take a small trip, and leave their son and Lady in the care of Aunt Sarah. However, Aunt Sarah has no tolerance for dogs, and prefers the company of her Siamese cats, Si and Am. When the cats end up causing a mess, Lady is blamed, and taken to a pet store for a muzzle. The experience frightens Lady, and she runs from the pet store. Unsure what to do, she ends up in a bad part of town, where she is chased by 3 large dogs. At the last moment, Tramp appears, fighting them off. Upon seeing the muzzle on Lady, he offers to help her get it off. After sneaking into the local zoo, they manage to trick a beaver into thinking the muzzle is a 'log-hauler.' The beaver gets the muzzle off, and uses it to help him finish his dam. Tramp then takes Lady to a restaurant named Tony's where the owner (Tony) and his cook Joe prepare a meal for the two dogs. After dinner, the two stroll through the night, and fall asleep at a local park. When they awake, Lady is upset for not going home right away. Tramp tries to 'open her eyes' to life without leashes and fences. However, Lady feels a responsibility to watch over the baby. Tramp takes her home, but along the way, decides to have a little fun by rousing up a henhouse that he sees. When the owner appears with a shotgun, Tramp and Lady make a run for it. Lady doesn't get far, when she's caught by a dogcatcher, and taken to the pound. Once inside, she is ridiculed for her license and cleanliness, before another female dog named Peg gets everyone to stop. Talk then turns to the Tramp, who still hasn't been caught and (to Lady's shock), appears to have known quite a number of female dogs. Eventually, Lady is released to Aunt Sarah, who ties Lady to the dog house out back. Jacques and Trusty come over, hoping to cheer her up, but the mood is spoiled when Tramp appears. Jacques and Trusty leave, and Lady lets her pent-up emotions out on him, from the embarassment of being being in the pound, to hearing about the other women Tramp has been with. Tramp leaves, but Lady's attention is soon drawn to a rat, that she sees enter through an open window in the baby's room. Lady barks, trying to get Aunt Sarah's attention, but the old woman thinks that Lady is just making a racket. Tramp hears Lady, and after she explains what has happened, he enters the house. Making his way to the baby's room, he confronts and fights the rat, finally killing it, just as Lady arrives after freeing herself from her leash. Aunt Sarah finds them in the room, and thinks that they were intending to attack the baby. After locking Tramp in a closet, Aunt Sarah puts Lady in the cellar, before calling the pound. Shortly thereafter, Jim Dear and Darling return, to see Tramp being led away by the dogcatcher, claiming he attempted to attack the baby. Trusty and Jacques hear this and assume the worst as well. However, once Jim Dear looks in the baby's room, he finds the dead rat, and it soon is apparent that Lady and Tramp were trying to protect the baby. Jacques and Trusty rush off to stop the wagon before it reaches the pound. After spooking the wagon's horses, the wagon overturns, but ends up injuring Trusty. Time passes, and soon it is Christmas again. Tramp has been made a member of the family, and he and Lady have puppies of their own. Jacques and Trusty (with a cast on his leg) come to visit them as well, and they celebrate the holidays together.",

         "I grew up watching this movie. I consider it a wonderful movie for both children and adults to watch. While many of today's animated Disney movies are aimed at kids, this movie is from a time where adults were primarily the target audience. This movie lacks the 'kiddie' humor and tells a wonderful tale of genuine emotion and compassion. The love story between two non-human characters removes most bias that we automatically impose upon human characters. I feel that few movies will ever match this one in quality.",
         "If this film isn't a classic, I don't know what is! This is a great story about two dogs who fall in love, although they're from different sides of the railroad tracks, so to speak. These dogs act more human than many humans do. It's heartwarming, humorous and just plain clean family entertainment! This is a film that has stood the test of time and passed with flying colors. This is one to BUY and keep! So what are you waiting for? Go buy it!",
         "Fairy tale about the romance between two dogs from opposite sides of the tracks gets colorful, warm, old-fashioned Disney treatment. Cinemascope cartoon unfolds with valentine-like flair, all the ribbons and bows are in place, yet the requisite cutesy flourishes and manipulation inevitably turn up (one dog, thought to have been killed, shows up LIMPING in the next scene!). Yet, it's hard to complain when the rest of the pieces fall into place so snugly. The plot is, by turns, comfortably predictable and still pleasingly reassuring, though a bit heavy with incidental chatter. The Peggy Lee music is delightful, and the \"Bella Notte\" sequence alone, with the spaghetti, breadsticks and the drippy candle, is simply superb. *** from ****",
         "\"Lady and the Tramp\" is indeed one of my all-time favorite Disney movies. I just love every single bit of it! The story, the characters, the music, the stunning animation style...everything is amazingly done! This is exactly what today's Disney flicks have been lacking- they don't recapture the spirit and magic of the original Disney masterpieces like this movie and the other Disney classics such as \"Bambi\", \"The Aristocats\", and \"The Fox and the Hound\", except for contemporaries like \"The Lion King\", \"Toy Story\", \"Tarzan\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", and \"Mulan\", which are still well-set up. Okay, back to \"Lady and the Tramp\". This movie deserves ten out of ten stars, and those of you who haven't seen it yet have gotta watch it. It's not presented only for the youngsters, but also for those who are young at heart. If you really enjoy it as much as I do, don't miss the astounding follow-up to the original in the delightful \"Scamp's Adventure\"!",
         "There is nothing as wonderful as the wag of a dog's tale. The writers, actors and animators, together with Disney magic, capture the unique and limitless variety of personalities that exist in the canine world. This film takes these wonderful canine characters and shows the world from their perspective. The adorable footage of Lady as a puppy reminds me of the behavior of my own hounds when they were pups. The beautiful \"Park Avenue\" Lady grows up and falls for the happy-go-lucky, vagabond, Tramp. Add a dog-hating aunt, a baby, some cats, some rats and the adventure is complete. The songs sung from the dog pound together with those sung by the wicked Siamese cats are the most purely fun of any Disney animation. The song sung at the lover's romantic Italian dinner brings a tear to the eye. Finally, Lady and the Tramp share a spaghetti noodle that leads to one of the most memorable kisses in Hollywood history. This is a wonderful film that will be enjoyed for generations.",
         "One of the few Disney cartoons at this period not based on a famous piece of literature--so at least no one can complain that it doesn't do justice to the original! It's an unpretentious little gem, told from the viewpoint of the animals and against interesting backgrounds with superb animation and vocal work. Cat lovers may find it painful to watch how sinister the two Siamese cats are depicted--but not if they have a sense of humor. Actually, the 'Siamese Cat Song' is one of the highlights of Peggy Lee's novelty numbers. 'Bella Notte' and other simple melodies are integrated nicely into the plot with satisfying results. This was the first Disney cartoon made in Cinemascope so the artists had to fill a broader landscape for the camera to photograph. And yet, the transfer to video on VHS format is extremely well handled--you don't feel you're missing anything. I believe the film is also available in letterbox but I find the VHS print I own to be more than satisfactory. Delightful Disney classic for young and old alike.",
         "Lady and the Tramp, one of my favourite childhood movies, goes down as a classic animation and one that I am sure is enjoyed by children today. Who doesn't like watching cute animals with large, kind eyes? Lady and the Tramp is about love and sacrifice, bringing together a posh female dog with a homeless stray, who is sexy in his own right. Also included are the memorable Siamese trouble-making cats (Peggy Lee) and the wonderful candle-lit scene where are lovable heros enjoy spaghetti. This film should be enjoyed and treasured for years to come. It's gone down in Disney and film history. Although made for children, there isn't any reason why adults cannot enjoy this film.",
         "Yet another winner from Disney about an upper-class dog who falls for a mutt from the streets. The timeless love story works just as well on a feature-length cartoon as it does with live-action fare. The animation is first-rate, the characters are fun and the songs will stick with you long after the movie is seen. Great entertainment for all ages. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",
         "Peggy Lee was a national treasure. What an amazing thing that she wrote most of the music for this movie, but only in old age did she receive credit. I agree that issues of class seem merely consistent with the era, but consider that the flavor of the day was vanilla. So in those days going out for Italian was a walk on the wild side (unless you grew up in Brooklyn)! Then an upper-crust girl marries a boy of mixed race origins?! And it's clear from the dog pound scene that Peg \"got around\" (just look at her hair!), nevertheless, she was valued and respected among the dogs. Yes, the film is hokey. But rats are evil. And the soundtrack is outstanding.",
         "''Lady and the Tramp'' is one of the most adorable movies from Disney, and until I read in IMDb, I would never guess that it is from 1955! I always imagined it to be from the 70's, I don't know exactly why. Lady is a cute golden cocker spaniel that was a present from '' Dear''(the husband) to '' Darling'(the wife) at Christima's. She was threaded very well since she was a puppy and is an adorable dog that loves to spend her time with her owners. Two of her best friends and neighbors are Jock and Trusty. One day, Tramp, a god without a breed and without a license goes to the wrong side of the town (the rich side) and ends up meeting Lady. She stays scared with his lifestyle, but at the same time she could not avoid fallen in love with the experienced dog. They fall in love at the same time that Lady is having problems at her home ( Darling is pregnant, so, nobody in the home really cares about her as before). But her love with Tramp will have bad consequences, being the first one being caught by the Dog Catcher and knowing more things about Tramp that she actually would like..."

Lady runs away with him only to be caught by the dogcatcher.",
         "Jim \"Dear\" and \"Darling\" have had Lady, their pedigree cocker spaniel, since she was a puppy. Using her charms on them, Lady has been a pampered part of their upper class life, which all three consider perfect and complete. Lady's life takes a bit of a turn with the imminent addition of a baby into the household. Lady doesn't really know what a baby is or means, but gets a lesson in such from her two neighborhood friends, Jock, a proper Scottish terrier, and Trusty, a hound who doesn't realize that he may have lost his sense of smell. The baby's arrival indirectly has an effect on Lady's perfect life, most specifically when Aunt Sarah, with her two mischievous Siamese cats, comes to babysit. To escape this negative turn in her life, Lady eventually turns to Tramp, a mongrel she once met. Tramp lives a carefree life on the \"wrong side of the tracks\", and is renowned within his circle as being one of the most resourceful dogs, who is able to escape capture from the dog catcher as being unlicensed. He is also known as a womanizer. As Lady and Tramp fall for each other, the question becomes whether their two divergent lifestyles can mesh together, and if so what form that will take.",
