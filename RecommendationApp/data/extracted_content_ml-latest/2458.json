      "synopsis": "Officer Frank Dooley (John Candy) is a 10-year veteran cop of the LAPD who gets framed for the theft of a television set by two corrupt detectives. In court, Dooley's accusations against the two \"well respected\" detectives who framed him falls on deaf ears and is dismissed from the force, but escapes criminal punishment. After the defeated Dooley leaves the courtroom, the next case features hapless defense attorney Norman Kane (Eugene Levy) attempting to defend a white supremacist leader (a Charles Manson look-alike), who threatens him with death should Kane fail to keep him out of prison. A fearful Kane reveals his ineptitude to the elderly by-the-book judge (Stacy Keach, Sr.), who agrees to give the criminal an especially long sentence in exchange for Kane immediately leaving law behind. The unemployed Dooley and Kane meet for the first time when they both apply for work at Guard Dog Security, a low-rent firm run by the gruff Clarence O'Connell (Kenneth McMillan) whom is part of a security guard's union requiring heavy contributions that is represented by Klepper (Jonathan Banks) and Lazarus (Brion James). Becoming licensed security guards after a single afternoon of training, the pair are made partners by supervisor Maggie O'Connell (Meg Ryan) and assigned to night duty at a pharmaceutical company's warehouse. After being loudly ordered to take a lunch break by senior guard Bruno (Tom Lister, Jr.), they happen upon an armed robbery of the warehouse and prove no match for the masked, heavily armed thieves whom get away in a truck with several of the warehouse's supplies. Kane, with no experience in handling firearms, runs and gets chased by a group of Doberman guard dogs in the warehouse, only to be saved by Dooley who beats up the dogs. The next day, the pair are berated and fined $100 each by O'Connell, leaving them suspicious of the company they work for. They attend a meeting of the union, where Kane pointedly questions union president Michael Carlino (Robert Loggia) about how the union dues are spent following Carlino's rejection of his grievance against Guard Dog. Over the next few days, Dooley and Kane find themselves assigned to work at a landfill and a toxic waste dump. It is here where Dooley and Kane hear a smilar story from two other security guards whom worked at a similar warerhouse three weeks earlier and were re-assigned to the toxic waste dump as punishment. Convinced something illegal is afoot, the pair track down Bruno at his gym and roughly interrogate him. Bruno cracks and states that it was O'Connell who had him order them to lunch the night of the robbery. Afterwords, the duo make a quick getaway from the gym. Dooley and Kane then question an old informant at a pier in Santa Monica about how much he knows about Carlino and his union organization. The informant confirms (demanding a bribe from Kane at first) that the company, Guard Dog Security, is a front for a union racketeering group that may be Mafia controlled. They bring their suspicions to Maggie, O'Connell's daughter, but she rejects them as having no evidence to back them up. The pair next attend a formal dinner party thrown by Carlino in hopes of gathering some evidence. While trapped inside a overheated steam room, they eavesdrop on a meeting between Carlino and union treasurer Lou Brackman (James Tolkan), they learn of Carlino's use of the union's pension fund to finance dealings with a Colombian drug cartel and his plans to have the money robbed from an armored car and then have insurance cover the loss. Dooley and Kane prove too late to save Brackman from being murdered by Klepper and Lazarus to keep him from talking and find themselves framed for his death. As a result, Dooley and Kane are forced to run for their lives from both the thugs and the same two bad cops who framed Dooley. When Maggie asks her father if he has anything to do with Carlino's business doings, O'Connell refuses to answer her and tells her to stay out of his business. After a night spent evading pursuers (where Dooley and Kane are forced to impersonate a transvestite and gay leatherman to evade the police), the pair make plans with a now receptive Maggie to prevent the armored car robbery. Kane and Maggie take over driving the truck, while Dooley will meet them ahead of the would-be robbers. Dooley has problems with his motorcycle and is forced to hitch a ride with The Cowboy (Steve Railsback), a wild trucker who eagerly disobeys traffic laws. Meanwhile, Kane and Maggie must avoid assaults from multiple cars attempting to hold them up. With The Cowboy's help, Dooley is able to arrive in time to save the armored car from a guided missile strike and foil a final attack from Klepper and Lazarus. O'Connell, no longer willing to abide the scheme, arrives having captured Carlino and several of his associates. The criminals are arrested and Dooley is invited back to the police force, along with a reluctant Kane.",

         "This was a nice surprise. I figured it would be stupid and not all that funny. Wrong. It WAS funny. Yes, it's a harmless \"no-brainer\" type of movie but it was fun and had likable lead characters, people you could easily root for to make good. In this, it was a pair of security guards: \"Frank Dooley\" (John Candy) and \"Norman Kane\" (Eugene Levy). Every comedy has its stupid moments, this included, but the good outweighs the stupid. What also makes this above-average is that it is not just a comedy. There is action and suspense in here and the combination works. Believe me, this film is not all laughs. I watch this and makes me sad that Candy is no longer with us. He was a great entertainer.",
         "Armed and Dangerous is one of John Candy's best films! Eugene Levy, Meg Ryan, Brion James, Robert Loggia, James Tolkan, Kenneth McMillan, and Tom Lister Jr. were all good. I loved the performance Lister and Candy did together! I don 't like to make fun of anybody but it was so funny every time Candy would make fun of him and I loved Lister doing his Zeus Trademark in the film! If are a fan of John Candy and the above cast mention and love hilarious action packed comedies with good music then I strongly recommend that you watch this classic movie soon!",
         "Although I'll probably take some heat from saying this, but I love this film. I grew up watching it and it gets funnier every time I see it. If you're a die hard Candy fan, you have got to see this movie. Although this isn't Candy's best film, it definitely shouldn't be overlooked.",
         "This is one of the movies that I dont see why people hate it. It was too me a funny movie. Maybe it's the fact im a fan of the talent involved with this movie. John Candy is good like usual. Eugene Levy is good as usual. Meg ryan looks good.. :D what? Was this supposed to be the godfather? no. its just fun, and funny movie. It's too me a good movie. But since I am trying(and failing) to add more meat to these reviews i post here's the plot outline i stole from imdb. heheh Frank Dooley is an ex-cop, thrown out of the force after being framed by corrupt colleagues. Herman Kane is an out of work attorney who quit because he lost his nerve. Both men turn to a private security firm to find employment, but everything goes quickly wrong when the first warehouse they guard gets robbed! Dooley and Kane suspect foul-play, and there's something fishy about the security firm's union too. Our two heroes decide to investigate, and uncover intrigue and conspiracy, with only their ingenuity and resourcefulness keeping them alive Thanks to Simon N for that plot summary. It's a decent plot, I still cant see whats so bad about this movie. Oh no. theres one scene that might offened people but im not going to get into how stupid i think getting offened by a movie is: but that scene is when candy and levy go into this sex store and stuff happened. I wont ruin it because that's probably the funniest part of this funny movie. 7/10 or 70%",
         "This film is an all-time movie classic. Candy shines in this clumsy romp with the laughs flowing thick and fast. The all-star cast shows the obvious appeal of the script and doesn't fail to deliver in a film that appeals to a wide age-range. The plot takes a back seat as the best enjoyment comes from watching the cast deliver and the effervescent John Candy performing at his comedy best. This film has a feel-good factor and the quality of the performance has brought me laughs again and again.",
         "I saw this movie for the first time last month, and im still laughing about it!! This movie has some of the funniest parts ever in it. This movie isnt as funny as Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, but it's pretty darn close!! If you liked Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, you should definately check this one out.",
         "Frank (John Candy) is a good policeman but he is framed for theft when he catches other officers pilfering electronics. He is kicked off the force in short order. Meanwhile, Norman (Eugene Levy) is an inept lawyer who messes up big time when he assigned to defend a Charles Manson type offender. The judge in the case orders Norman to find alternative work. With few options, Frank and Norman both enroll in a security guard officers training school, where they become fast friends and partners. This is, in part, because so many of their classmates are complete idiots, like the man who wonders if he should put his own name on the application line that says \"name\"! Frank and Norman's first assignment is to stand watch inside a factory but they soon realize that their company, Guard Dog Security, may have some criminals on the staff, ones that are stealing from the companies they are supposed to be guarding. Can Frank and Norman, with the help of the firm-owner's daughter, Maggie (Meg Ryan), expose the bad elements in the company, without getting fired or killed? This is a very funny film with abundant laughs. Yes, it may be considered a more \"low-brow\" vehicle, but it is still very mirthful and will cause any viewer to laugh themselves silly. Just watching the less-than-intelligent guards on the staff of the security firm makes for a fun, fun evening. Candy, Levy, and Ryan are terrific but, then, so are the relative unknowns who round out the rest of the cast. Sets, costumes, and production values are great, too. If you want to see a classic Candy film, this is a great choice, for it displays his marvelous and abundant talent, no doubt. But, anyone truly wishing to transport themselves to a world of laughter will find this one a very good choice.",
         "In a way, maybe it does weaken \"Armed and Dangerous\" just a little to have so much high action, but how can you not like a John Candy/Eugene Levy movie? In this case, they play security guards who discover all sorts of corruption. But mostly, it's an excuse to be silly. Low humor, sure, but still likable (especially the clothing-switching scene; I bet that they liked filming that!). Anyway, it's one of many movies that shows what we lost when John Candy died. In other words, it's armed and dangerously funny. Also starring Robert Loggia (happy birthday, Robert!), Kenneth McMillan and Meg Ryan. A 50 caliber...",
         "While most reviews describe this movie as 'just an average comedy', even at this, Armed and Dangerous is a laugh and a half. It's charming, fast-paced, and furthermore, I adored Candy and Levy's interactions on-screen. One minute, they're ragging on each other, the next, they're the best of friends. The movie also has, though almost impossible to find a copy of, an excellent soundtrack, including \"Armed and Dangerous\" by Atlantic Starr, and, of course, half a dozen or so other popular 80s hits. With that, the movie is also on DVD, and while it doesn't have much in the way of extras, it does include anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Stereo 2.0 Surround Sound. Possibly the only complaint one could make we might all agree on was that it was just too short. At just under an hour and a half, as endearing as each minute is, the film does leave much to be desired. All in all, Armed and Dangerous is a mid-80s classic well-worth watching. It's the perfect blend of action and comedy, and SCTV fans will find that it's no flop for either Candy or Levy; even as the script is considered by some to be lacking, both hide it well.",
         "I loved this movie about a framed police officer and an inept lawyer - turned - security guards. Once licensed and assigned to their new jobs, they uncover a labor union (teamster/Mafia) plot to embezzle a load of money from the employees Pension and Welfare Fund. John Candy is almost serious in this role as he ferrets out the bad guys, defends the honor of Meg Ryan's character (Maggie Cavanaugh) and helps to reverse her father's wayward ethics. Oddly enough, Eugene Levy is the funny guy to Candy's \"straight man\" act. It is an odd formula, but it was quite effective. This is one of Candy's better movies, and the most serious role in which I've seen him, thus far. (LOVED Candy's small role as Augie Morosco in \"Once Upon A Crime,\" 1992) --- (On the firing range, after a demonstration) \"As you can see, it's really quite simple. Just remember, when you pull the trigger, the bullets come out going very, very fast. So make sure to keep the weapon pointed away from you. Now that's about it, you are now ARMED guards, God help us all.\" Maggie Cavanaugh. --- I am a true John Candy fan, and own most of his movies. But while many of his fans have all but dogged this production, I found it quite entertaining and a breath of fresh air. Also starring Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr. as \"Bruno\" (President Lindberg in \"Fifth Element\" and many, many more), Robert Loggia as \"Michael Carlino,\" a Jimmy Hoffaesque character, and Kenneth McMillan as \"Captain Clarence O'Connell,\" Maggie Cavanaugh's father. Meg Ryan's performance was sweet and honest. She has done better, but this was in 1986 and her experience was not yet as worldly as it is now. Even without taking that into consideration, hers was one of the brightest of the supporting roles. In the end, Candy's character's reputation is redeemed and his life as a law enforcement officer is restored and plays out to a very satisfying 1980's ending. While there are better comedies out there, and also while most of Candy's other movies are better, this is one of my favorites of his line. It gets a 6.8/10 from... the Fiend :."
