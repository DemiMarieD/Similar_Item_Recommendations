Yet to think that they don't have fans from movie land would be wrong - case in point Death Wish 5: The Face of Death.\r\n\r\nOften considered to be the runt of the litter, it's actually better than what some would have you believe. OK! So the formula is the same as usual, Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey will have to take up his vigilante arms once again when someone close to him falls by the wayside. The law is still an ass and the bad guys can literally get away with murder, but they can't get away from crossing the path of Kersey.\r\n\r\nIt is what it is in that respect, another chance for Bronson to please fans of the series, to attack his role with machismo and a quip on the tongue. Where inventive deaths are conjured with a side order of vigilante relish. There's even strains of film noir in here, with a henchman as a transvestite and another with a dandruff problem that bothers him so. There's even a mannequin factory for added noirish flavours.\r\n\r\nThe production isn't exactly high end (tongue in cheek folks), and the usual suspension of disbelief is very much required, but for fans of Chuck and the series, then this delivers the goods. Bloodily so. 7/10",

      "synopsis": "Back In New York City, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is in the federal Witness Protection Program using the name Paul Stuart, teaching architecture at a local college. Kersey is invited to a fashion show given by his girlfriend, Olivia Regent (Lesley-Anne Down), who was formerly married to mobster Tommy O'Shea (Michael Parks), and with whom he had a daughter Chelsea (Erica Lancaster). Backstage during the fashion show, O'Shea threatens Regent, insisting that he wants to see his daughter even though the courts removed his visitation rights. O'Shea and his goons are using the garment factory to launder dirty money, and demand that Albert, the factory manager, increase the amount of cash they launder. Kersey sees the bruises on Regent's wrist and learns O'Shea is downstairs. O'Shea meanwhile threatens Albert and insists he has to pass more cash. Albert resists, saying that it will create trouble, and O'Shea wounds Albert with a fabric knife. Reggie intervenes and is wounded as well. Reggie decides he has enough of O'Shea's abuse and takes Albert to the hospital. Tommy threatens Regent , and Kersey enters the factory floor. Kersey confronts O'Shea, but his goombah Tommy threatens Kersey and points a gun in his face. The daughter Chelsea appears and O'Shea leaves. Chelsea shows her mother the blood on the fabric knife. NYPD officers Tony Hoyle (Saul Rubinek) and Hector Vasquez (Miguel Sandoval) visit Kersey at his home. Kersey tells them about Tommy O'Shea and Hoyle reveals that they've been trying to nab Tommy for years. He asks if Regent is willing to testify. Kersey will talk it over with her. That night at a restaurant, Kersey proposes to Regent, and she accepts. Regent excuses herself to go to the ladies' room after spotting Tommy. An associate of Tommy's, named Freddie Flakes (Robert Joy) enters the bathroom in drag and ties her up tightly, and tapes her mouth shut. While mocking her and lecturing her about her possible testimony, he bashes her head in a mirror, permanently disfiguring her face. Flakes leaves, passing Kersey as goes to check on Regent. Kersey goes to the hospital, where he is told by a nurse that Regent will need to have reconstructive surgery. He then talks with Lt. Mickey King (Kenneth Welsh), who admits that they've been working on the O'Shea case for 16 years. Kersey is angered by this, but King wants Kersey not to pick up his old vigilante habits and let the police handle it for once. As this is going on, Tommy breaks into the factory and demands from Reggie information on who he talked to. He threatens him by burning his hand and face, before killing him. Lt. King and female officer Janice Omori (Lisa Inoue) set Albert up as an informant, but Sal sees through his act and runs Flakes down with the car, smashing through the window of a restaurant. Flakes then runs over Omori with the car, killing her. Kersey sees Omori die, but Flakes drives away before Kersey can do anything. The next day, Kersey takes Regent back to his apartment and informs Hoyle by phone that Regent will not testify. He then goes over to Hoyle's house at night and says that she will: Kersey couldn't tell Hoyle over the phone because someone else was listening in. Hoyle informs Vasquez, and they send a cop over. The cop comes over and Kersey answers it. Kersey stops and hesitates at letting him in, recognizing the cop as being Flakes. Kersey informs Olivia to use the fire escape to make her quick getaway, as Flakes and two other men break in and start shooting the place. Flakes follows Regent up to the fire escape, and shoots her in the back. Kersey escapes by jumping off the ledge, and falling into a pile of trash bags. Franke, Chicki (Kevin Lund) and Sal (Chuck Shamata) move in for the kill, but sounds of police sirens interrupt their plans. The following week, Kersey and Chelsea both mourn Regent 's death and watch TV to see that Tommy has been cleared of his involvement in his ex-wife's death. NYPD officer Tony arrives to offer his apologies to Paul, but Kersey orders him and the team sent to protect Kersey off his property. A short time later, Vazquez arrives with Tommy and handing him a court order: since Kersey wasn't legally married, Tommy has claim over his daughter. Kersey fights but gets knocked unconscious. Kersey now becomes a vigilante, and gets his gun ready. Kersey follows Chicki to an Italian restaurant where he orders cannoli. While Chicki is in the restroom, Kersey laces it with cyanide. Chicki finishes one cannoli, but dies shortly after starting the second one, and as he is choking, Kersey pushes his face into the plate. Vasquez reveals to O'Shea that Chicki was killed by Paul. (Revealing two things at the same time: that Vasquez is dirty and O'Shea thought Kersey was his alias Stuart all along). Paul's next target is Flakes who is in the bedroom with his big breasted girlfriend, whom he manages to take out in his fortress-like home and blows him up with a rigged electronic soccer ball. Kersey then calls Hoyle and arranges to meet with him privately. As Hoyle hangs up, he hears another conversation (which signals to him Kersey was right regarding an earlier conversation). Kersey waits at Regent 's house, holding one of Chelsea's dolls until Vasquez comes and points a pistol at Kersey. Without hesitation, Kersey shoots Vasquez. Hoyle arrives and sees Vasquez dead, and finally understands how far deep this goes and Kersey's vendetta mission. Hoyle is in cahoots with Tommy, but finally lets Kersey handle it his way. \"I was never here\" he tells Kersey as he leaves. As a funeral procession for Flakes takes place at a local church attended by local mobsters, a young boy enters and gives O'Shea a receipt. Back at his headquarters, O'Shea's associates open the crate and it is revealed to contain the dead cop (Vasquez). Tommy talks to Sal back at his house, and the two resolve to take a final stand again Kersey by using Chelsea as bait. Sal grabs Chelsea and Kersey follows Sal, just as Tommy predicted. Back at his house, Tommy hires three more men, Frankie (Scott Spidell), Mickey (Tim MacMenamin), and Angel (Sandro Limotta) to take care of Paul. Kersey arrives at the factory and using his survival instincts, tricks the three into shooting up a dummy in a forklift with the presumption that it's him. Kersey appears and kills Frankie and Mickey and wounds Angel in the leg. Angel is led by Kersey to the plastic machine. Kersey turns it on to wrap him in plastic. Angel reveals Chelsea's location, and is hooked up on the movable rack by Paul. He then radios O'Shea using Frankie's channel, announcing that he is coming for him. Chelsea hears this and easily escapes Tommy's grasp. O'Shea orders Sal to find and kill Kersey. He comes across Angel and mistaking him for Kersey, shoots him. Sal turns off the machine and continues to search. Kersey appears and knocks Sal into a grinder in the next room. The police soon arrive as Chelsea escapes the factory building. Inside, Kersey manages to find Tommy and beats him. Lt. King arrives and is quickly wounded by Tommy. Kersey manages to defeat Tommy by knocking him in a pool of acid, and leaves him to die. The final scene shows Kersey making sure King is okay before he leaves, calling out \"Hey Lieutenant, if you need any help, give me a call\" before reuniting with Chelsea.",

         "The beginning of this final installment of the long-running \"Death Wish\" series is shaky with inappropriate humor (even the title comes off as a tasteless pun, as a central character is disfigured by having her face bashed into a mirror) and a lot of mobster-movie clichés (the henchmen to Michael Parks' villain are howling stereotypes), writer-director Allan Goldstein transforms \"Death Wish 5\" into a surprisingly entertaining little crime thriller. Though frequently riddled with inept moments (the mobsters unload round after round into walls after their target has jumped out of sight) and plot holes (how is Kersey tracking the bad guys, and since when did he become an explosives expert?), the film is the most well-developed of the series in terms of character, plot, and pacing. I've never seen Charles Bronson more convincingly expressive than he is here, and Michael Parks (\"Kill Bill, Volume 2\") is utterly reptilian in his loathsomeness. While the plot is essentially a repeat of the previous films, it contains a confident gloss that lifts it out of exploitation and closer to a mainstream film--it isn't entirely successful, but rooting for Bronson never gets old.",
         "What a massive and regretful shame and lost it was that our good old beloved screen legend Charles Bronson passed away last august. Suddenly it meant that a great and talented actor and certainly one of the toughest and coolest action flick stars ever was gone forever and it also killed all the hope to ever get the final sixth episode in the \"Death wish\" saga. I know it was extremely unlike dream but right until I heard the sad and shocking news somehow part of me was always hoping for him to still make a return to the shoes of Paul Kersey for the very last time. At least the minor possibility was there. Unfortunately this was one of the last films of his respectably long career. Bronson was aged and tired but his acting was nevertheless still enjoyable. If I only look at \"Death Wish V: The Face of Death\" as an individual action movie it's definitely pretty senseless, simple, ordinary and cheesy. But that would be a mistake. The only proper way to see this film is to consider it as the fifth part of the famous motion picture series and at least when I personally watch it with this in mind I can only admit: in the end it's far from being all that bad.",
         "**SPOILERS** The fifth last and most vicious and violent of all the \"Death Wish\" movies based on the sadistic and brutal scenes in the film, even though the body count in \"Death Wish V\" seemed to be the lowest of all the previous sequels with the exception of the original \"Death Wish\" back in 1974. Paul Kersey, Charles Bronson, now thanks to the Withness Protection Program is living as an non-violent and law-abiding citizen in New York City, Paul is a professor of architecture at a local university. With his life back to normal, no more shooting of criminals, and having a classy and beautiful lady-friend Olivia Regent, Lesley-Anne Down, who has a cute and adorable daughter Chelsea, Erica Lancaster, things couldn't be better but then \"They\" came on the scene. What \"They\" did to Paul's future wife and to his and her friends, including little Chelsea, made Paul turn into the crime fighter and personal avenger that he tried to put behind him. In the end \"They'll\" never be the same, or in one piece, again after the outraged and infuriated Paul Kersey does \"His Thing\" or \"Job\" on them. \"They\" are a Westie-like organized mobster gang headed by Paul's lover Olivia's former husband and little Chelsea's father Tommy O'Shea, Michael Parks. Tommy is a borderline psycho who loves to hurt and torture people that he doesn't like or who don't obey him as fast as he want's them too. Getting his hands on the garment industry in NYC Tommy has a stranglehold on Olivia who has a line of clothes thats produced from a business that she owns there. The O'Shea mob starts to put the screws on Olivia's business and those working for her. The local D.A Tony Hoyle, Saul Rubinek, gets a number of workers in the garment center to agree to testify against O'Shea and his mob. Unknown to D.A Hoyle there's a member of his staff who's tipping off O'Shea to who's to testify and has the O'Shea mob murder them before he, D.A Hoyle, can provide them with police protection. One of those who's at first viciously mutilated and later murdered by the O'Shea Mob is non other then Olivia,this brings the wild animal out of the peaceful and kind Paul Kersey. Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey takes on organized crime in \"Death Wish 5\" unlike the mostly unorganized street thugs and criminals that he took on in the previous four \"Death Wish\" films. Again like Kersey did in the earlier movies he does the bad guys in, and finishes them off, in the most spectacular ways that he can devise. Even though he was 73 at the time in 1994 Charles Bronson is very believable as the avenging vigilante Paul Kersey knocking off the entire O'Shea Mob. Kersey does his unpleasant and bloody job not only with bullets but with cyanide-laced pastries exploding soccer balls and clothes making and knitting machinery. Tommy O'Shea, as well as his gang, gets his comeuppances by being dropped, by Paul, into a boiling vat of acid and made to look a lot slimmer and 150 ponds lighter. Not realizing that their no match at all for the angry and rampaging Kersey the O'Shea mob tried to trap him, by kidnapping and holding hostage Chelsea, at the plant and do him in. Kersey was on to them from the start and in the end it was he who was the hunter and they, the O'Shea Mob, who were the hunted with the results, in this deadly cat-and-mouse game, being a forgone and bloody conclusion for them not Paul Kersey.",
         "Every Death Wish movie is a classic. They continue to get higher body counts and plenty of action. I never get sick of watching Bronson blow away these scumbags. All of Bronson's movies are great and I think he is by far the greatest actor that ever lived. My favorite films of Bronson have to be the later ones. Kinjite, Death Wish 1-5, Murphy's Law etc. Bronson had big budgets to work with and plenty of people to blow away. The ending of each Death Wish just gets better and better. Blowing people away with Rocket Launcher's, Cannon's, Bazooka's, throwing villain's into Acid. How can any action fan not love this stuff? My favorite Death Wish film is part 4. What a great plot and plenty of Bronson action but Part 5 is also very good and the Villian played by Parks does a really great job. I saw this film in a packed theater and fans were clapping and cheering for each Bronson kill, It was great! The DVD was even better. Death Wish 5 had a good plot and plenty of bad guys for Bronson to play with. I would really like to see Bronson make at least on more Death Wish movie. In part 5 his closing line was \"Call me if you ever need any help.\" Well, Mr. Bronson today's action heroes are a joke and we could use your help to mop up these clowns. Guys like Vin Disel, Arnold, Stallone, Van Dam, Siegal to name a few. Even at your age these punks can't hold a candle to your acting or screen presence. I hope to see you again on the silver screen soon. That is my \"Wish\"",
         "After years in L.A., Paul Kersey is back in New York with his new fashion-based designer fiancée Olivia Regent and along with her young daughter Chelsea. Kersey has put away his old habits, until Olivia's ex-husband Tommy O'Shea (who happens to be mob figure) uses her business to run an illegal money laundry scheme and tries at every optometry of scary her from testifying against him in court. They go one step to far when they disfigure and then later on kill Olivia. By law Chelsea is to live with her father. This tips Kersey's world up side down and vengeance mode comes kicking back in. What a crying shame. I'm shocked to see the user rating for this \"Death Wish\" instalment to be so low. Making it by far the weakest of the series. I don't agree, but hey you can't have it all your own way, right. Anyhow, this was the filth and final \"Death Wish\" to date and it was actually the first one I ever saw. Maybe that's why I seem to cut it a bit more slack then say number four. So, it's been going on for twenty years and Charles Bronson (who was around 70 at time) is still around looking to quite fit and rather animated. Definitely more so than his two previous efforts. Back to form with his dry, ice-cool persona and showing some feeling along the way. What I like about this outing (other than being a improvement over \"Death Wish 4\") is that it seems to go back to the dark underbelly and cruel vibe (maybe more so) that worked in the earlier forays. Kersey is up against more upper-class foes, than the usual street pests. At heart is goes back to the basic, heavy-handed revenge yarn, where the detailed situations are harrowing and the violence is simply cold-blooded. He might not want to return the favour (as firstly he lets the cop do their job), but his finally forced back into his beloved side-trade, as it's in the blood and the loved ones are taken away from him\u0085 again. Once you start, there is no going back\u0085 even when the police know his secret. The way he subtly toys around with the guilty criminals to get them rather anxious, waiting for their turn to be mowed down. Only adds to that ominously nasty touch that waits and the dark humour has real snappiness to it here. The deaths scenes are at times wickedly inventive (well it beats going up to someone and just shooting them) and rapid stunt work is exceptionally pulled off with such thrilling poise. Oh and how can I forget about the gratuitous slow motion? Some times it works and other times your thinking\u0085 \"Oh why?\". Anyhow you gotta love it on this occasion! As director (and writer) Allan Goldstein stylishly tailored it on a much larger scale that seemed to pay dividends with its competently showy set pieces and crisp pacing. There's always something there to hold your interest. In all, there's no denying it's by the numbers and the predictable plot has a fair share of clichés grounding it. Although it goes out there to delve a little deeper into the material (a highly witty and concise script: \"Idiots with guns, make me nervous\".) and truly making you feel for the characters. The hammy bad guys are typically portrayed as slimy, ruthless tyrants that deserve what they get. You'll sure be cheering on Kersey here, after you cop a taste of the lively performances of Michael Parks (who's tremendously scummy as Tommy O'Shea) and Robert Joy (makes light work as the paranoid nutter Freddie 'Flakes'). Lesley-Anne Down's presence simply glows and is credibly good as Olivia Regent. Giving able support are Saul Rubinek, Kenneth Welsh and Miguel Sandoval. The technical side of the production is soundly staged. The special effects are put to good use and come off well. What is nailed down is a traditionally sounding music score that likes too flutter about with loud echoing cues and the standard camera-work sufficiently frames every shot with nice scope. By me saying it shares some common ground with the original films. I guess you'll be hoping for something rough around the edges and some exploitation to fit right in. Too bad, as that isn't going to happen. Those looking for the obligatory rape scene too (which appears in basically all four), forget it. This one is going for the mainstream pool. Even the ending has that cop-out feel about it with what has gone all before it. For all your troubles it's nothing more than a glossed up, blunt action/crime vehicle for Bronson, which manages to mix the good and not-so-good aspects of the series. Only fans should bother.",
         "I have noticed in the previous parts that Charles Bronson's character is himself a total psycho/mentally \"ill\" person. And that's totally understandable knowing what he's been through. So both the bad and the good guys are real extremes also in their sickness (in these movies). You have to be \"freakin'\" crazy to fight these crazies. \"Fight evil with evil\". \"If you \"have\" to fight, you have to fight dirty.\" \"Because war in itself is bad, evil and crazy.\" (These citings are not from this movie, they're just clichés.) Is there any other way? But compared to the bad guys Bronson's character is also very, very sad and sympathetic. It's sad that some people have to see and experience so much evil in this world. It is a very interesting character and portrait of a time and a frame of mind. And the bad guys are not as comical as in some other Death Wishes, they are somehow more realistic. From the start setting of this film some mental professional would suggest that Bronson's character is begging for blood and violence in his life: He has hooked up with some psycho-sadist-mob boss's ex-wife, who has a daughter with the mentioned. But let's not be shrinks. Shrinks (both amateur and pro) seem to be wrong very often, maybe as often as non-shrinks. Maybe it's just because they have fallen in love. And maybe Bronson/Kersey has heard about this only later. One of the most important questions that these movies rise is: What would YOU do? Would ethics and philosophy of forgiveness be enough, if some person would for example kill some of your loved ones with no reason. Would you think that that person has deserved forgiveness and is worth of that? If that person would be a repeated killer, who has been in jail a couple of times already for his/her former crimes/killings? Would you think of that person as an equal to some person you love, and who you know is trying to be as good person as he/she possibly can? The movie is very well directed, shot, acted. Good editing and music. The atmosphere is whole. Some nice pictures. It's also more sexy than all the other parts combined. This might be one of the 3 best of the 5 Death Wishes, but wouldn't 3 have been enough? Obviously not, because these movies are just a small glimpse of the \"vigilante\"/revenge-movies genre... Worth seeing.",
         "I am a great fan of the Death Wish films as I love to watch Bronson knocking off one by one the scum of society. My favourite is the number III by a long chalk but this one isn't bad either. This one also has some very comical moments notably when Chickie dies when eating a cyanide flavoured \"canoli\" (whatever that may be !!). Also, what is interesting here is when Bronson gets rid of the scum using different methods than just the usual old \"gun\". In this vein, I liked most the radio-controlled football which blew apart Flakes' face, and the death of the villain at the end in the acid bath when we see his flesh melting away off the face in the acid. The only reproach I would make to the film are its picture and sound quality ( on the dvd at least ). These are really not up to scratch for a film made in the 1990's. I eagerly await the day when Death Wish 3 and Death Wish 4 will be available on dvd. Bronson is truly a great actor, whatever the role he plays, but he is especially effective in the part of a vigilante.",
         "CHARLES BRONSON reprises the role of vigilante PAUL KERSEY for the last time in this final chapter to the \"Death Wish\" series. The story starts out with Paul Kersey going under the name PAUL FINE & taking up the job of a college professor, he is also engaged to a new woman named OLIVIA, who also has a pretty little daughter, but like always, being Kersey's girl puts you in the arms of danger & Olivia is soon attacked & later killed by a group of men who work for her mobster ex-husband, so Kersey as always, decides to take revenge. Fifth chapter in the series is in my opinion, the best sequel to follow after the excellent, but violent original, the violence was also surprisingly played down & the story is much better than the last three installments, you see, unlike the last three where Kersey's family is killed, rather than picking up a gun & blowing the scum away who killed them, Kersey stands back & lets the cops handle it, but when it turns out that the cops can't do anything, he decides to take revenge, but in a different way, while he still uses a gun to blow some of the bad guys away, he also uses poison, bombs etc. Bronson puts in a fine performance, as do the rest of the cast & the bad guy characters are extra slimy & hateful. All though I was secretly hoping that Kersey would return in at least one more \"Death Wish\" movie & go on one last crusade before retiring, I'm kind of glad the series ended with this one, it was a fun decent sequel that closed the series out with style (At least I thought) I mean let's face it, each sequel was basically a remake of the last, i.e. Kersy loses his family, Kersey seeks revenge on the ones who did it etc. I mean you have to ask yourselves the question, What are odds of the same thing happening to the same guy five times? Bronson/Death Wish fans should check this out. R.I.P. MR. BRONSON, were gonna miss ya! ***1/2 (stars)",
         "Gangsters have bullied and murdered a woman. Now they had better watch out, because her fiancée is none other than Paul Kersey \u0096 and it's time for Mr. Bronson to dispense some more swift justice! While this entry in the Death Wish series doesn't have the highest body count (see part 3 for that) and isn't the most grim and gritty (see part 2), it is the most sadistic. You see, in previous films Bronson got his wrathful business done with his trusty sidearm \u0096 but we get some variation in this one. Here he breaks out a marvelous assortment of deadly amusements such as the exploding soccer ball and poisoned pasta mentioned in other reviews \u0096 all seen in graphic detail as they work their murderous magic. Add to that the stress on facial disfigurement and scenes involving torture by steam press, plastic wrapping machine, and radial saw \u0096 and you have a new and wonderfully vicious formula for more Death Wish mayhem. This is not the best in the series, but Bronson's presence alone gives it distinction, and it manages to make the most of the obviously very limited budget. If you're a fan of the series like me, you'll enjoy it in all its unpleasant, uncompromising glory.",
         "With his cousin and long-time partner Yoram Globus gone after the private feud that errupted when Cannon Films went bankrupt, Menahem Golan turned to schlock producers Ami Artzi and Damian Lee to produce the fifth entry of the series. Surprisingly, especially considering the general quality of their output, they manage to improve on the poor quality of DEATH WISH 4. The production values (as low budget as they may be) aren't as cheap as they were before, Bronson is a bit more lively in his performance, and the screenplay tries more for a story of substance. What really makes the movie fun at times is its twisted sense of humor. There's some nice black comic-moments, such as with one particular mobster's funeral scene, or the later plastic wrap sequence. Even better is Michael Parks' performance as the chief bad guy. His various comments (improvised?) about anything are hilarious, and he lays on the ham very thickly to be a lot of fun to watch. It still could have been better. One of the two big problems with the movie is that it takes about half of the movie for Bronson to start his rampage of vengeance. Even with Parks' entertaining performance, you'll likely be squirming in your seat with impatience for Bronson to get it on. And when he *does* get it on, it's kind of underwhelming - there's not much of a body count, and the length of time between kills is relentlessly padded. At least the end results are not the worst way the series could have ended. (By the way, Golan actually announced \"Death Wish 6: The New Vigilante\" in the trade papers not long after this one was released, though his company going bankrupt put an end to that plan.)"
