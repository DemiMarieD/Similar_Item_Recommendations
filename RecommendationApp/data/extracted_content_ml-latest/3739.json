      "synopsis": "Opens with a man lifting a trash can and moving it across the street. He dumps the contents on a small boat. Someone starts singing as the man goes on his way on the boat he dumped the trash in. Someone is buzzing a doorbell and we see a man running and climbing down a tree. A shadow on the wall. The women buzzing the door argue and buzz the door again. There is a man on the floor and he gets up slowly but falls back down. The camera pans across the houses and stops on the baron, Gaston Monescu (Herbert Marshall), smoking a cigarette. The waiter comes up from behind and shows him a map. They speak. They talk about how they would start a dinner between Romeo and Juliet. a quick glimpse of a woman on a boat. the baron talks about the moon and says he wants to see the moon in the champagne. He also says he doesn't want to see the waiter at all. A woman answering calls. An operator. She gets excited from a message and relays it to a man in an office. People are arguing and hollering. The woman, Lily the Countess (Miriam Hopkins), from the boat arrives at the Baron's dining room. She says a man almost saw her in the hall. She says she ran all the way up there to avoid him. Says she shouldn't have come but the Baron says she did come. That she is accepted there. He takes off her jacket and she goes to sit at a chair, and then moves to the window. She says if the Marquis sees her, he'll tell the other Marquis and the other Marquis will tell another Marquis. Gossip will reign. She sits in a chair and the Baron tells her to keep on complaining because it's beautiful. She thought he was American at first sight. She's not disappointed to know he is one of them. They kiss and the phone rings. He answers it and he gives the phone to the woman because it is the Duchess. She's invited to dinner at their palace. A shot of the Duchess telling her what to do tomorrow. The woman gives her compliments to the duke. She says the scandal is now on to the Baron. A room full of men arguing. A man asks Filiba (Edward Everett Horton) how much money he had. Filiba said he had exactly 20,000 lira. He cashed the check and put it in his wallet. The man goes back to argue with the other men. The man asks why Filiba let the man in. Filiba said he said to come in because it was a doctor that said he came to see about his tonsils. The other man argues with the police again. The president of the police wants to know if there's anything wrong with the tonsils. Filiba says no and said the culprit was a very charming fellow. They argue more and Filiba said he let the man check his tonsils. All he remembers is he said \"Ah\" and it was the last thing he remembered. The Baron asks about Filiba to the waiter. The waiter tells him about the incident and then leaves. The Baron talks with the Countess. She talks about how something has changed her. She confesses that the Baron is a crook and knows that he robbed the man in room 253, 5, 7 and 9. She asks for the salt and he gives it to her. The Baron confesses that he would have told her everything. He says the Countess is a thief. The wallet is in her possession. He says her embrace is so sweet. He locks the door and pockets the key. The blinds close and he takes the Countess in his arms and shakes her to get the wallet out. He puts the wallet in his pocket and they continue eating. He asks for the time and she gives him a watch that's slow but tried to sync the time. He says that he hopes he can keep her garter. They embrace and she wants to know who he is. He says he is Gaston Monescu. They embrace and kiss. They confess their love. The doors to 300/02 open and a Do Not Disturb sign is posted on the door. The man who dumped the contents of a trash can appears on his boat at night. Someone is singing in the background. A shot of radio waves coming from the Eiffel Tower. A man stands before a microphone with papers in his hand. He tells of news from Geneva about Monescu robbing a peace conference. He took everything except the peace. The police arrested him but he escaped in an unexplainable manner. A man starts to sing the Colet and Company song about perfumes and how they're the best perfumes available. A meeting being held. A woman, Madame Colet (Kay Francis) is sitting by listening. Giron (C. Aubrey Smith) says that the first thing the woman's husband would do would be to cut salaries in times like these. Business bores her to distraction so she says they should leave the salaries just the way they are. At a jewelry shop, Madame Colet is helped by the clerk. He shows her a purse and she says it is too much. She asks about a 125,000 franc item. She'll take it. Colet speaks to Filiba about marriage being a beautiful mistake two people make together. But with Filiba, it would be a mistake. The Major (Charles Ruggles) is turned down by the Madame as well. Filiba and the Major are waiting for the Madame to come down. Filiba says he dislikes the major intensely. They might just as well make conversation. The major only says \"tonsils.\" The Madame sits in a balcony watching a play. Filiba leaves while the Major stays. She says both men are stupid. She wants both men to apologize to each other. The Major tells off Filiba. He goes back to Madame Colet and tells her that Filiba has left. Monescu is using binoculars to spy on Colet and the Major. He sees them arguing. The opera starts and we see the pages of the music turning on their own. The countess speaks to a man in a top hat, takes something from him and goes back in the room. Madame Colet comes out of the room and goes to the Major. Her bag is missing. The Major doesn't know where it is. They make a racket in there and go out to search for it. They search the ladies room and the Major quickly comes back out. The play ends and everyone is leaving. Monescu comes out of an empty room and walks down the hall. Fade to black. The Major goes into jewelry shop and wants to look at some cufflinks. Filiba is there as well. They make small talk but the Major is annoyed. Zoom in on the Countess looking at a newspaper. She lowers it and looks at Monescu. They talk about the opera. They talk about a previous incident Monescu was involved in. He remembers everything about it and gives her a kiss. He tells her everything will be alright. Prosperity is just around the corner. She gets up and says for him to read the newspaper. They see the reward amount and he ponders what he would have gotten for selling it. She tells him to return the purse for the 20,000 francs. Colet is shown bags by people looking to receive the reward. She takes a phone call and says it's not the purse. A Communist idealist says he hasn't found it and insults her about spending so much on a bag. Monescu walks in and shows her the bag. She tells Jaques to tell everyone to leave because the bag has been found. She asks where he found it and he tells her about a statue of Venus. That is where he found it. She says she was nowhere near the niche. They introduce each other. He lies about his identity. He takes out every item just to make sure it is hers. He says he read the love letter but to not accept the Major. They speak about different make up and lipstick. The Major arrives and Monescu tells the Major she should not be seen today. He mistakes Monescu for a doctor. Filiba arrives and the Major asks Jacques (Robert Greig) if the bag has been found just to make a fool out of Filiba. Monescu leaves but not before Colet says she's embarrassed to offer the reward. Monescu says he'll take the reward and she goes off to write the check. Monescu runs up the stairs and tells her that his name is Gaston and to make the check out to cash. Colet looks around her desk for her checkbook. Monescu is looking at a painting. He disappears when she turns to look at him. He's standing in her secretary's room looking at her bed and a piece hanging on the wall. She discharged her secretary for being too happy. He asks if the secretary put the check book in her safe. She checks it and Monescu is looking at her hands to remember the turn of the dial. She pulls out 100,000 francs in her safe. He tells her that it is not enough money to put in the safe. She says it's very sensible and clever. He is hired by her to be her secretary. A meeting with the board of directors. Monescu says he speaks for the Madame when he says for the board members to resign if they do not like the salary cut. They will think it over. Monescu finds out Colet's life insurance is 1 million francs. Burglary insurance is suggested to be raised to 852,000 francs. Madame asks Gaston to come down to enjoy the party. He declines and says he has to be up early in the morning. Gaston speaks to the Countess as she types. He tells her half of her interest will go as usual to her account. The other half will be delivered to Madames personal custody. He says the money will be theirs. She wants to get the jewelry but Gaston says no jewelry. The Countess wants the necklace with the sea pearls and says it'll go beautiful with her neck. Jacques comes in and says Colet wants to speak to the Countess. Colet speaks with the Countess, who is in disguise with glasses. She tells Colet that she has to wake up early to take her brother to school because her mother is dead. The Countess picks up a piece of jewelry and gives it to Colet. The Countess makes Colet's coffee better with sugar cubes. Colet is eating potatoes and notices the Countess is looking at it. Colet says she knows Gaston doesn't want her to eat potatoes and doesn't want to upset him but can't help it. The Madame asks if the Countess has noticed any change. She says yes and no. Colet says he works too much. She wants the Countess to take over some of the duties of his work. She thanks Colet and Colet makes her salary 350 francs. The Countess explains that Colet wants Gaston and that 350 francs isn't enough. Colet is talking to François on the phone and says she can't see him because of business reasons. Gaston says Countess is talking like a child. She wants more than the jewelry now. She wants Gaston to open the safe now. She wants to leave now because she hates the place. She doesn't want him to become a gigolo. A shot of a clock and Countess saying that if Gaston behaves like a gentleman, she'll break his neck. Colet wants Gaston to go out to dinner with her tonight. A phone rings but no one answers. Gaston and Colet come back. Gaston says goodnight and they complement each other on how they dance. The clock strikes twelve. Then when it strikes two, Gaston and Colet say goodnight to each other, Gaston turns off the clock light and goes into his room. There is a party of sorts and Colet is waiting for someone. She sees Gaston and takes him away to talk to him. He's introduced to various people. Jacques tells a member of the board that she will meet him in a bit. Filiba and the Major are arguing and Colet quiets them. Colet introduces Gaston to more individuals at the party. A woman tells Filiba that Gaston is her secretary and Filiba becomes suspicious. Gaston speaks to Filiba and asks if they've met before. Filiba doesn't seem to recall the occasion. Colet meets with the board member. He tells her that there are papers she must attend to herself. He tells her he was a school friend of her husband. He asks who Gaston is and she says he is her secretary. Colet asks Jacques to bring him in. Filiba says he knows he never met that man. He says it's driving him crazy that Gaston asked if they met. He confronts him and before he can finish what he wanted to say, Jacques tells Gaston that Colet wants to see him. The Major confronts Filiba and says he is giving a dinner party. He asks Filiba if he has a dinner jacket. Colet asks Gaston to look over some documents while she goes back out. The board member says he has some questions he has wanted to ask for some time. He hopes he finds those figures of the documents correct. The board member says he's known the Novels for a long time. Filiba smiles at Gaston and then walks off. The man gets mad about Gaston seeming to ignore his inquiries. Gaston asks if he is insinuating anything. They argue about making each other nervous and Gaston tells the man to be calm and that he'll call. Gaston goes to the Countess and is about to say something but is interrupted by Jacques. He tells Countess that Filiba is here. Gaston meets Filiba and says goodbye to him. Filiba asks if he has been in Venice. Gaston says no and asks if Filiba has been in a few cities. He says Venice can't compare to Constantinople. Filiba whispers something to him and he whispers something back that makes Filiba want to go to Constantinople. Gaston talks on the phone and buys tickets to Berlin on the night train. They have to leave now. He reserves them under a Spanish name. They'll clean the place out tonight and leave. The Countess speaks Spanish over the phone. He says he'll meet her at the station tonight. Gaston calls a flower shop and orders deep red roses and wants them sent to Madame Colet the next day at 10 o' clock. He says to charge it to Madame Colet. The Major prepares cards at a dinner table with the names of the people attending the event. He puts Filiba's card at the short end of the table. Filiba is sitting on his bathtub with shaving cream on his face. He's pondering something but shakes his head. Madame Colet walks out of a room in a black dress. She knocks on Gaston's door and he opens it. She asks what they'll do tomorrow and he says they'll have breakfast, go horseback riding, lunch and then a nap. She asks if he likes her look and he compliments her. They say goodnight and goodbye to each other. She goes down the stairs before Gaston asks if she will be staying out late. She asks why does he ask and then says no. She continues down the steps slowly then rushes back up to his room. The Countess is cleaning out her wardrobe while humming. Jacques knocks on Colet's door and she answers from Gaston's door. Jacques tells her the car is here but she says she won't be going. As Jacques is leaving, Gaston informs Jacques that Colet changed her mind. Colet says she doesn't want to go but Gaston tells her to go so people don't talk about them. He's afraid people will ruin her reputation. She says that Gaston is crazy about her otherwise he wouldn't be thinking about her reputation. She says she doesn't like him and wouldn't hesitate to ruin his reputation. She tells him to kiss her and they kiss. Jacques answers the phone and says he'll try to reach him again. He dials a number and says that Gaston and Colet are both busy. Countess puts down the phone and anxiously hums a tune to herself as she continues to pack. Jacques comes to Gaston's door and knocks on it. Gaston answers from Colet's door. Jacques says Giron is waiting downstairs but Gaston says he can't meet him. He says the Madame is also not going anymore. Colet tells Jacques to not dismiss the car. She's leaving. Gaston doesn't want her to leave but she says she wants to make it tougher for him. She leaves after saying they have a long time left. Gaston calls the Countess on the phone. The Countess is happy to hear from him. She starts to get sad and just answers with one word responses like \"oh\" and \"ah.\" Colet is sitting with a drink in her hand. Filiba and the Major talk about how it must be the secretary that's making her feel good. Filiba compliments the Major's suit. Filiba also says Gaston isn't a bad person and that he's just a secretary. The Major said the first time he saw Gaston, he thought he was a doctor. They realize now something is wrong. Filiba says \"tonsils\" to Colet. Gaston checks his watch. Jacques talks to him. Gaston meets the board member and says he doesn't have the time to talk. The man knows his name is Monescu. Colet leaves the party in the car, leaving Filiba and the Major behind. The board member says Gaston will pack his things and leave tomorrow or he will call the police. Gaston estimates the board member will be 87 when he comes out of prison for not calling the police in the first place. Gaston bids goodbye to the board member by calling him Adolf, walks up the stairs, hears the doorbell and comes back down. He opens it and Adolf stands there and tells him to not call him Adolf. Gaston heads back into his room and is about to close the blinds when he sees the Countess. She is trying to open the safe. Gaston asks if she's insane and tells her she has to get out of here. and she says she wants to get away from here, away from him. As far as 100,000 francs will get her. She asks what Colet has over her and tells him to not lie to her. The Countess is about to leave when Colet arrives. Jacques answers the door and lets Colet in. She walks up the stairs without saying anything. She knocks on a door and Gaston answers from her room. She smiles and walks into the room she knocked on. Gaston joins her and kisses her. She takes off her jewelry and says the man must ask where she wants her jewelry placed. Gaston says the night table and she says she doesn't want to be the lady. She goes to her safe while Gaston looks on. She says Francois thinks Gaston is a remarkable man. Gaston asks what she would say if she found her safe to be robbed. She would call the police instantly. He tells her that Adolf Giron, the board member, has been robbing her for years. He expects the police to believe it if she doesn't. He picks up the phone to dial for the police but she stops him. She sits down and Gaston talks about Giron. He says his name is Gaston Monescu and the police will be happy to identify him. She asks if he took the money and he says yes. She says he wanted 100,000 francs when she thought he wanted her. He tells her he came to rob her but fell in love with her. She walks away and he sees the Countess in the other room. Colet sees the Countess. The Countess says she took the money all by herself. Now Colet can have her romance. She advises Colet to put on gloves when she embraces him. It would be too bad if her fingers are found. Colet thanks her for her advice and tells her to go. Gaston walks in and the Countess berates him for wanting to give up 100,000 francs just for Colet. Countess berates Colet for paying so much for a handbag and tells her she can have Gaston. She bids goodbye to Colet and company. Gaston leaves and there is commotion outside the door. The sound of running. Colet is left alone to wonder what happened. She sits on a sofa and Gaston comes back in. He walks over to her and bids goodbye. She gets up and shakes his hand while saying goodbye. He says she could have been marvelous, divine and wonderful. He says if she should hear a knock and there is a police with a warrant, she will be glad she is alone. She says it could have been glorious, lovely and divine but for that terrible policeman. He bids goodbye and kisses her. He asks what she's missing and she nods. He says no and pulls out her necklace from his jacket. She says with the compliments of Colet and Company. He puts the necklace back in his jacket and leaves. Gaston and the Countess are in a taxi and he searches for the necklace. He looks at her and she pulls it out of her own jacket and puts it in the purse. She looks for the francs and he pulls it out of his pocket. They embrace and kiss.",

         "An utterly beautiful film. I watched this for at least the umpteenth time last night - maybe once a year every year since I taped it off TV in 1987. Did it let me down? It hasn't yet and I don't think it ever will: I was as captivated by it as I was the first time, and yet it portrays a world, its people and their actions I'll never know, and probably wouldn't want to know either. Some people I know can't watch any film or TV programme a second time and are puzzled when I can - but then could listen with pleasure to a piece of music for a thousandth time. Lubitsch's peerless masterpiece about two crooks (Gaston and Lily) moving amongst high society, falling in love with each other, with high society and with high society in the attractive shape of rich businesswoman Madame Colet falling in love with Gaston is a witty, charming, sophisticated, erudite, relentless, sparkling etc comedy that by the finish has had the effect of defragmenting my mind and deleting the real world for a short while - no mean feat! Every second of every scene carries it's witticisms, not a moment is wasted from the dignified opening with the title song fading into the rubbish boat on the Grand Canal in Venice to the swift orgasmic climax in the taxi in Paris. At the beginning when the stricken Monsieur Philiba rises and falls to the floor of his hotel room again and the Neapolitan music lulls you across a cheesy model set to where the smoking Gaston is urbanely discussing cocktails with a waiter you should know you are in for something special. Ultra demure Kay Francis gets to says Divine twice in a row! Even looking at nothing but a clock for a minute carries a soundtrack bulging with wit and innuendo. Something as unimportant as Herbert Marshall apparently running up and down Kay Francis's stairs (on camera, in mirrors or in sound only) turns out to be an in-joke - he had only one leg. Other running gags make you smile after the film has long finished, such as Positively Tonsils and No Potatoes. And to think about this film even years later it's always with the lilting, insistent, mocking romantic background music! But I could go on and on, there's enough in this for 10 films of today to borrow if they could make them like this any more. \"Frasier\" on TV has been the closest in sophisticated comedy in recent times, but even so it couldn't match TIP's compact inventiveness. Out of the 97 million movies I've watched this is definitely in my top 5 favourites. It's a pity that so many people can so easily be put off by black and white photography and bygone stars who they've never heard of; in this case what they're missing out on is near perfection, and again another film that will still be available when all of the undisciplined uncensored in-your-face films of today are forgotten.",
         "So funny, sexy, subtle and sublime, this film only gets better with each viewing, BUT it's not available in ANY format! WHY? Ernst Lubitsch used Laszlo Aladar's play The Honest Finder as a springboard for one of his most delightful early-1930s Paramount confections. Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins play Gaston and Lily, a pair of Parisian thieves, both disguised as nobility, who decide to rob lovely perfume company executive Mariette Colet (Kay Francis); Gaston gets a job as Mariette's confidential secretary, while Lily installs herself as the woman's typist. Love rears its head, forcing Gaston to choose between marriage to Mariette and a fast getaway with Lily. Filled with marvelous throwaway gags and sophisticated innuendo, Trouble in Paradise was described by one critic as \"as close to perfection as anything I have ever seen in the movies.\" For over seven decades this film has been unmatched in the realm of sophisticated farce. Films from THE AWFUL TRUTH to THE LADY EVE to SOME LIKE IT HOT are sublime on their more modest social scale and in their basic Americanness. By contrast, TROUBLE IN PARADISE has all the class and Continental elegance one associates with the Paramout of the 1930s. Made before the Production Code clampdown of 1934, this Lubitsch masterpiece shows his talent for sly sexual innuendo at its most witty and polished. The result is pure caviar, only tastier. The story tells of two jewel thieves, Gaston (Marshall) and Lily (Hopkins), who together work at bilking a merry widow, Mariette Colet (Francis), out of a small fortune. They secure jobs as her secretary and maid, but trouble begins in paradise when Gaston starts falling for his lovely prey and when one of her many suitors (Horton), a former victim of Gaston's, begins to recognize Mme. Colet's new secretary. The many laughs in this consistently delightful souffle come not only from Raphaelson's marvelous screenplay but also from Lubitsch's supple visual wit. On one hand there's delightful repartee about a former secretary who enjoyed an antique bed a bit too much, and on the other we have the sexy silhouette of Gaston and Mariette cast over a chaise lounge. From the opening shot of an operatic gondolier who turns out to be a garbageman to a police report about theft and tonsils translated for Italian officials, this film is full of unforgettable moments of merriment. The cast, too, is peerless. In one of his earliest Hollywood efforts, Herbert Marshall does the greatest work of his career. Too often maligned for playing stodgy consorts to dynamic star actresses such as Garbo, Davis, and Shearer, Marshall here gets to display his impeccable timing and supple grace. Frequently hilarious, his quiet approach and crushed velvet voice still let him remain suave throughout. Even Cary Grant would be hard pressed to match this portrayal. (He'd be too frantic.) Kay Francis, too, that popular sufferer of countless \"women's films\" with her \"twoublesome\" r's, gives of her very best. With her sleek, glamorous style and elegantly wry line readings, she is light, sexy, and totally captivating. Her doorway caresses and her finger-snapping seduction of Gaston are priceless. Miriam Hopkins was luckier in that she had many more chances to display her comic flair in film. Today one of the most underrated and unfairly maligned stars of the 1930s, the brittle, feisty Hopkins can rattle off witty banter at a breakneck pace or she can be deliciously languorous and coy. Her enjoyment of her own sexuality is heady even today and the thieving competition between Gaston and Lily, in which escalating crimes turn into escalating passion, remains one of the greatest scenes of foreplay ever caught on film. Ruggles and Horton prove yet again that they are two of the greatest farceurs in Hollywood, and the rest of the cast is equally choice. (One standout is Leonid Kinskey, whose bit as a leftist radical only foregrounds the satiric anarchy of the entire film.) Beautifully handled from start to finish, gleamingly shot and full of Dreier's incredible Art Deco designs, TROUBLE IN PARADISE is Lubitsch's greatest film and one of the indisputable highlights of comic cinema Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, the master of sophisticated comedy, Trouble in Paradise (1932) is the most accomplished example of the \"Lubitsch Touch\" for stylish innuendo and sly wit. With a script by Samson Raphaelson and Grover Jones, Lubitsch derives sparkling humor from the lusty (Pre-Code) love triangle among two jewel thieves, Lily and Gaston, and their intended victim, Mme. Colet. From the opening image of a garbage gondola's gliding through the picturesque Venice canals, Lubitsch makes light of the notion that amorality lies beneath the glossy exteriors of the rich. Elegantly sending up idealized movie romance, Gaston and Lily fall in love as they attempt to rob each other blind over an intimate dinner, sealing a bond between two scoundrels. Such Lubitsch details as a hand's hanging a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on a doorknob and the shadow of a couple cast on a bed neatly communicate the nature of Gaston's relationships with Lily and Mme. Colet, complementing the clever dialogue, spiked with nimble come-ons and ripostes, and delivered with aplomb by Herbert Marshall, Miriam Hopkins, and Kay Francis. Praised for its smoothly imaginative technique and comic invention, Trouble in Paradise burnished Lubitsch's reputation as Paramount's premier purveyor of 1930s Continental class, and it is still considered one of the best adult comedies ever made.",
         "First of all, let me say that this film is as close to perfection as one can get---look at the \"throw away gags\", the play with words, the wardrobe (Miriam Hopkins stole the show; especially in the Opera scene when she comes out of the \"Parlour des femmes\" & asks her \"Sugar Daddy\" for some \"francs\" to give to the ladies room attendant---that black dress was haute couture at its best!), the gait of the actors, the snappy dialogue. They all look so-o sophisticated & worldly. SHEER PERFECTION! It took me 5 years to get this film & it was worth every minute! This is MY FAVORITE film!",
         "Beautiful, spellbinding romantic comedy with a suave jewel thief (Herbert Marshall) falling in love with his intended victim (luminous Kay Francis) much to the displeasure of his girlfriend (Miriam Hopkins). Beautifully shot (the scenes seem to glow), incredible sets and costumes, a very witty script, wonderful performances by everybody, superb direction by Ernst Lubitsch and some fairly racy Pre-Code material. What more can I say? It's perfection. A must-see!",
         "Ernst Lubitsch had a tendency towards pushing the boundaries, whether it was the boundaries of the Production Code or the boundaries of one's stomach, as it's splitting from laughing at his films. \"Trouble in Paradise\" is one hundred percent, absolutely, no exception to this rule. This film has got to be the greatest film comedy of the 1930's (toss up between this and \"Bringing Up Baby\" ... perhaps??). The situations, the dialogue, the characterizations, the rich sexual undercoating ... FANTASTIC!!!",
         "Pay no attention to \"littlesiddie\" - the one naysayer in this group. All the others are raves and rightly so. This is the most elegant and sophisticated romantic comedy ever committed to celluloid. The pacing is perfect, the performances enchanting, the plot priceless, and shame on the Academy for ignoring it. An absolute must-see! Edward Everett Horton and Charles Ruggles as comic rival suitors for the hand of Kay Francis are so adept one might have thought they had been playing together in stand up vaudeville for decades. Francis is wry, experienced, and in it for the romance, not the entanglement, as is Herbert Marshall- they are a match. Miriam Hopkins is the perfect foil for them both. The famous Lubitsch touch is never more evident. A masterpiece.",
         "Although this film is greatly valued by critics, film historians and its many fans, it still does not receive the respect it is due. Turner Classic Movies broadcasts Casablanca, Now Voyager, Citizen Kane, Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib, African Queen and Bringing Up Baby 10 times for every time this film is shown. It is an injustice that this film is shown so rarely. (I would recommend to TCM that they show their \"classics\" less frequently and a number of less well-known films such as this more often.) Trouble in Paradise is a comedy counterpart to a melodrama; it is a romantic melo-comedy. It is unlike any other Lubitsch film with which I am familiar. In fact, it is difficult for me to think of any film with which to compare this masterpiece. The cast is outstanding, each delivering dialog in mock melodramatic style. The soundtrack, the editing, and especially the sublime writing all combine to produce a unique, satirical melodrama parody. Perhaps this film was the model for many later films that hoped to attain the same comic irony, but seem humorless to me. The key seems to be that the actors do not take themselves seriously, but they portray characters who do. Everything about this film is fabulous. I cannot fathom how anybody could suggest this film is outdated in any manner because it captures the ambiance of an era so perfectly. The era is past, but not this film! Do period films made today seem outdated to them? I do not need to heap redundant praise on a film that other commentators have described so well. So that you know where I'm coming from - I admit to being a HUGE Lubitsch fan. The Shop Around the Corner and Ninotchka are also among my very favorite films.",
         "In the first minutes, two nobles dressed to the teeth--the Second Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higgenbottom, let's say--exchange brittle, achingly witty repartee. It's all rather droll until Lady H. picks up the telephone to inform her staff at home that she'll be late for dinner. The director, Ernst Lubitsch, cuts to the other side of the conversation--and we see a fat landlady in a hovel crawling with cats looking baffled at the receiver and saying, \"Whaddaya sayin'?\" At that moment, you know that Lubitsch and his ideal-mate screenwriter, Samson Raphaelson, are playing a pretty sophisticated game--and in the nearly seventy years since this movie, comedy directors from Billy Wilder to George Cukor to Woody Allen have been playing catch-up. TROUBLE IN PARADISE remains the most perfect of all sound comedies--it makes you feel as if you had consumed some celestial compound of champagne and helium. The surprise of the movie today is not the pleasure of its Lubitschian elegance, but the fact that the movie is screamingly funny at every turn--Lubitsch's smart bombs never miss their mark. And for all the applications of his \"touch\" we're grateful for, Lubitsch never again made anything so flawless--in these less-than-ninety minutes, he and Raphaelson turned dialogue comedy into Mozartean music.",
         "Once, \"The Lubitsch Touch,\" was as well known as Hitchcock's reputation as \"The Master of Suspense.\" \"Trouble in Paradise\" is Lubitsch's unqualified masterpiece. This pre-code sophisticated comedy epitomizes the European attitude toward sex in its very first scene between Hebert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins. Marshall reveals he has stole Hopkin's garter without her knowing it and she leaps in his lap. She checks -- at the dinner table no less -- realizes it is gone and with the admiration of one thief for another leaps into his lap. \"Darling!\" she says. No one has to guess what she has in mind, although it is all done with the wit and brio that the \"Lubitsch Touch,\" refers to. It's great to have this film readily available and the DVD version includes an informative and enlightening commentary (Marshall only had one leg and his lurching walk made a certain speedy cutting necessary that helps give the film it's light, speedy quality). Lubitsch also made \"Shop Around the Corner,\" remade by Nora Ephron as \"You've Got Mail,\" and \"Ninotcha,\" with Greta Garbo. His musicals with Maurice Chevalier and Jenette MacDonald, such as \"The Merry Widow,\" are also worth seeking out.",
         "Please read the other reviews for the full measure of this treasure - I will just string together my observations: Amazingly deft display of international sophistication for such an early film - who knew? Pre-code comedy of adult realities, without a hint of exploitive sensationalism. Herbert Marshall as a romantic lead, every bit as good as, say, Cary Grant or Ronald Coleman - at absolute top of form, like everyone in the cast. Again, who knew? Miriam Hopkins, just stunning. Pure chemistry with Marshall. Kay Francis, new to me, but gorgeous and utterly believable. And all the supporting players - C. Aubrey Smith, Edward Everett Horton, Charlie Ruggles, even Robert Grieg, the butler (as also in The Lady Eve, a film of similar polish) - each familiar from many other films, but scarcely if ever seen in better form. I truly do not understand why this film is not better known to me and everyone. I had to see it in a film class, and was frankly expecting much worse considering it was made scarcely three or four years into the \"talkie\" era. This is a polished many faceted gem, criminally under-circulated. It makes you wonder what Hollywood might have accomplished without an over-restrictive Production Code. I see DVD became available only in 2003? This is a MUST SEE!"
