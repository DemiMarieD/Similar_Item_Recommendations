      "synopsis": "It's the future - in 1970 :-) - and the first moon base has been in existence for a little while. The \"enemies of freedom\", including a Minister, need to destroy the base in two months' time. They are going to exchange one of scientists for a look-alike. Finally, Doctor Wernher (Larry Johns) is replaced at a hotel in San Francisco. They put a hidden microphone in the room of Doctor Wernher. Mr. Roundtree (Herb Jacobs) talks to him and tells Doctor Wernher's body double to destroy the station. Wernher asks for a car to leave the hotel and asks for a bellboy (Robert Paltz) to take his luggage out. The bellboy hits him in the nape of his head. He's paid on the spot. When the real bellboy arrives, the change has already taken place. Back at USSF SPACOM, the army good guys discuss the convenience of taking a civilian with them, as they could take the photographs they need, but it's about the politics, says Gen. Pappy Greene (Hayden Rorke). The White House tells Colonel Briteis (Donna Bartell) to check everything around the base. Maj. Bill Moore (Ross Ford) will begrudgingly be the pilot of the flight to the base. Donna and Polly Prattles (Barbara Morrison) enter the office. Donna will be the pilot, but Bill will be her co-pilot. She tries to avoid it, as Bill is jealous of her. [It's nice how her boss calls him spoiled and threatens to spank her if she does misbehave.] Polly is a journalist who wants to understand why the base and making photographs of the surrounding area. The space station Doctor Wernher wants to destroy will be the first step to build the base, essential for our future peace and democracy. Polly gets excited when she learns that she will weigh nothing because of the lack of gravity. The rocket is finally sent to space. Bill wants to hear a baseball match, and Donna mocks him. Donna wants to try to land on the Moon, not just going round the dark side with Dr Wernher. Preparing for the visit, Donna goes through some corridors with \"PLEASE, DO NOT WALK ON THE WALLS\" caption written on. Donna, Bill and Wernher leave the space station in a probe. Donna explains to Wernher about a button which overrides the automatic pilot. Bill overhears them. With his appearance, it looks like he's prevented Wernher to accomplish his mission. Bill realises that Wernher is part of the enemies, and Wernher overhears them. Although Donna doesn't believe Bill, Wernher attacks him. In the fight, the probe travels through space without direction. They have to land on the Moon, and Donna panics because they haven't got enough fuel to come back to Earth. Donna says she's sorry, because she didn't believe Bill before. Wernher remains tied up. Using some magnetic boots, they can walk normally without gravity. Bill releases Wernher because both of them are needed to walk on the moon and try to return home. Wernher will help him because \"he was forced\" to accept the job. Bill is the only one who returns to the probe: Wernher died establishing communications with Earth. They finally contact Earth: she explains that Wernher is dead and that they are on the Moon. The General tells them to stay there - they have become Moonbase 1 - because they have enough water, food and air for ten days. The President has devised this plan. Donna is told to leave the bridge, and Bill admits that he doesn't hate Donna anymore. Because of public pressure, - an unmarried man living with an unmarried woman is scandalous - it'd be better if Donna and Bill would marry, or at least that's what General Greene says. Donna overhears and is happy about it, but Bill doesn't pop the question to her. A shuttle finally arrives, but kind of landcrashes on the Moon: it's not a rescue mission, it's only a missile-looking devise with food, water... in a huge box. Donna talks to General Greene, and he's the one who marries them by videoconference. The President (Ernestine Barrier) says that their mission will keep people free. Bill and Donna kiss. ---written by KrystelClaire",

         "This minor little early fifties space picture was compiled of episodes of an unsold TV series titled \"Ring Around The Moon.\" This explains the films awkward bifurcated structure. The producers claim they thought these episodes look so great, that they decided to release it as feature film instead. While this may be true, I think its more likely the producers couldn't find a sponsor or a network that was interested. Which is a bit odd. For an early fifties T.V. show, this really doesn't look all that bad when compared to other early fifties shows like \"Rocky Jones: Space Ranger\" or \"Tom Corbett Space Cadett.\" PROJECT MOON BASE (or \"Ring Around the Moon.\") seems to have slightly higher production values and more ambitious special effects than other TV shows from the period. From watching this film, its seems there was an attempt to make something more adult than other shows on TV at the time. However, these sets and special effects must of looked inadequate when seen on the big screen even in 1953. There are some surprises here. The fact that the space commander is women is unusual for a film from the early fifties, although back in the early seventies when I first saw this film I didn't think that was so odd. What did surprise me was at the end when the president is shown to be a woman. One enlightened soul in this forum called this film \"sexist\" and \"paranoid.\" I wouldn't call a film that features a women as space station commander and a woman as president \"sexist\", and I don't see what is so paranoid about this film. Then again, maybe I'm clueless. Then again the term \"paranoid\" has been used by so many pedantic critics to describe just about every 1950's sci fi/monster flick almost as if by rote. Perhaps the most unusual thing about PROJECT MOON BASE is some of the names in the credits. The name almost always mentioned is the famed science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlan, who is credited as co-writer. It's a shame that this minor little film is one of the few times Heinlan ever worked on a film. The other name is Richard Talmadge who directed. Talmadge's career goes back to the silent period where he was one the silent periods great stunt men. He also was a star back then in his own right. Over the years Talmadge, acted, directed, produced, wrote and worked as a unit director on all kinds of films. Over all, PROJECT MOON BASE is a rather tedious film. I recently watched it on video and sat through it with only minor interest. Unless your a fifties sci fi buff, or a fan of Heinlan, or interested in the career of Richard Talmadge, PROJECT MOON BASE will probably be rough going. It's a minor curiosity, and a footnote in the career of Robert Heinlan.",
         "Not the worst possible idea for a movie (the screenplay actually credits famed sci-fi author Robert Heinlein), but just a really really boring one, filled with LOOOOONG drawn out scenes of really awful special effects and mindless prattle about spaceship minutia. Why do we need to see a 4-5 minute long scene of the male character slowly walking towards a satellite, pulling out a bunch of nondescript boxes and walking back?! Honestly, the most memorable thing about this movie is how insanely sexist it is. It's rather odd, too, considering that this movie features a female commanding officer AND in the end a female president, but it's totally impossible to miss: the women in the film are whiny, emotional and totally and completely clueless without male guidance. Here's a short list, mostly revolving around said female commanding officer, Col. Briteis. * General Green tells the Col. that she's acting \"Too big for her britches.\" * General Green and then the co-pilot constantly mispronounce the Colonel's name as \"Bright-eyes.\" * When she attempts to correct the General on the pronunciation of her name, he tells her to shut up. * When she protests further, the General actually threatens to SPANK her if she gives him \"more guff\" and points out that the room is soundproof so no one can hear her scream (my eyes almost popped out of my sockets when I heard that one). * The female reporter that is briefly in the movies is named \"Polly Prattles\" (oh lord), wears a sparkly bodysuit, and seems to know absolutely NOTHING about what's going on. * The Col. plays the 'stupid boss' role, refusing to consider that the scientist on board is a fake. * After they land on the moon, the Col. has no idea what to do and has to immediately ask the male co-pilot for help. * After having a minor emotional outburst in front of co-pilot, the Col. apologizes for \"going female\" on him. * When the Col. 'officially' asks for co-pilot's advice, he tells her to \"powder your nose.\" * The Col. spends five hours trying to reach Earth with no success; ten seconds after man wakes up he fixes the problem (all she had to do was press a button). * General Green orders the Col. off the bridge to have \"guy talk\" with the co-pilot about whether or not he's \"sweet on her.\" * When Earth comes up with the weird 'get married' plan, the Col. is never even informed of it. * Upon being sent away from the co-pilot for a total of about 3 minutes, the Col complains that she's \"lonely.\" This is all the more remarkable because I'm not a female-rights activist and don't recall ever noticing such an overt level of sexism in ANY film I've ever seen (and I've seen a LOT). The MST3K version is pretty funny; otherwise avoid like the plague unless you want a weird look at how overtly sexist mainstream movies used to be.",
         "Project Moonbase was a pilot for a planned TV series but that never happened. It is a rather obscure movie but at least it has been released on VHS and DVD in the States. A mate of mine did me a copy of his DVD. The United States is considering building is considering building bases on the Moon and an expedition consisting of a man and women plus a scientist, unaware he is actually a Russian spy is sent there to look at possible sites. After being found out, they land on the Moon and he is made to help to put up a radio mast, but is killed towards the end. The man and woman then get married while on the Moon by one of the controllers back on Earth and their new base becomes known as Moonbase 1. The President then speaks to them, who is female. The movie's score is rather eerie and the cast is mostly made up of unknowns, led by Hayden Rorke and Donna Martell. Their uniforms are certainly unusual: tee shirt and shorts and funny hats! This movie is worth looking at if you get the chance. A good way of spending an hour one evening. Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.",
         "In the near future of 1970 the US government decides to colonize the moon. They send three folks -- Gung-ho Major Bill Moore (amiable Ross Ford), bratty eager beaver Colonel Briteis (the adorably spunky Donna Martell), and enigmatic Dr. Wernher (solid Larry Johns) -- out into the area to take pictures of the lunar surface. But one of them is a saboteur who's determined to foil the mission. Director Richard Talmadge, working from a silly script co-written by noted science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein, treats the goofy premise with utmost seriousness, thereby giving this amusingly chintzy hoot the necessary clunky sincerity to acquire a certain irresistibly campy charm. The often dopey dialogue (sample line: \"Major, I think you're space happy\"), plodding pace, the primitive (far from) special effects (the spaceship looks just like some kid's toy rocket -- and probably was exactly that), tight 63 minute running time, plenty of unintentional laughs (the blast off sequence is hilarious!), Harschel Burke Gilbert's rousing \"spacey\" score, a startling plethora of gross rampant sexism, and William Thompson's static cinematography further enhance the substantial unintentional amusement to be relished in this enjoyable quickie.",
         "If you want a good Sci Fi movie to watch, this probably isn't it. It's old and low budget. In particular the costumes look quite goofy. The players are also unknowns or near unknowns. However it's such an early space movie that it's historically fascinating. The noted Sci Fi writer Richard Heinlein wrote the script. (He's more famous for Starship Troopers.) The movie attempts to portray space in a realistic way. Of course the technology looks thoroughly ridiculous to us now but this was done 60 years ago. Socially it was of interest because of the relative equality between women and men. Equality between the sexes was a theme in Heinlein, and amazingly it made it into this very early movie.",
         "Project Moon Base was made in 1953. Science Fiction movies had come a long way in the 3 years since Destination Moon and Rocketship X-M. Here we are given a glimpse of the future, projected to 1970, and it is a future with the US fully embracing space exploration. The look of the rockets and the overall plan for space exploration presented in the movie seems to be very closely based on the Collier's magazine series on space travel which ran from '52-'54. So this movie would have been very current when it first came out. I have to say, it is a wonderful vision of space exploration. The rocketships, spaceport, space station and moon lander are well done miniatures and the star backgrounds and lunar landscape are also well done. Robert Heinlein is credited with co-writing the screenplay, which tells a sophisticated story of (presumably Soviet) attempts to infiltrate an agent into the US space station and destroy it before a moon base is constructed. This is the surface story of the film, which is handled well in terms of how the space program works and how an agent might try to infiltrate it, but wow does it play out poorly. The scenes with the agent in the ship are really cheezy and amateurish. One of the clues that the impostor scientist is really an agent is that he does not know of the Brooklyn Dodgers - an old WWII trick for trapping enemy agents, but it seems silly here. The sabotage plans are foiled by our heroes (in an embarrassingly bad action scene) but the moon lander is stranded on the lunar surface without enough fuel to blast off. So far so good. But the real story lies beneath all this. It is a story of sex and gender politics in the workplace. And this subtheme is dialed way up! It takes over the movie. In the 1950s women began entering the workplace as equals with men, for the first time ever. Oh they had been allowed descent jobs as secretaries (complete with other implications), and during WWII many women took over men's jobs as the men went off to war, but now it is post war...can educated women work alongside men? Can they supervise men? Will men be threatened by this? Many of the sci-fi movies of the '50s explore this theme, but I have not seen one that could surpass the intensity of this movie. It is out of control and really must be seen to be believed. Col. Briteis (Donna Martell) is the commander of the spaceship. To say she has a rough time in the world of men is an understatement. When we first meet Col, a general tells her she was chosen for this mission for political reasons, not for competence, then he threatens to spank her! Wow. Bear in mind this is the beginning of the movie. Of course all the men pronounce her name 'Bright-Eyes' and oh boy there are plenty of winks and nods. Throughout the movie men are constantly correcting her, laughing at her and patronizing her. For the time period of the film, this is probably all in good fun, but from a 21st century vantage point it is hard to watch and is much more uncomfortable than funny. Bright Eyes...er I mean Col. Briteis...dominates the film, and this is a good thing because she is very sexy. She gets my all-time award for a performance during a blast off. Most everyone else in this obligatory scene looks as if the crushing force of gravity is torture, but with her it looks like...ecstasy. To continue the gender politics theme we have a female US President, and an assertive woman reporter. But ultimately the menfolk need not worry. At the end of the movie the alpha male co-pilot is promoted over Briteis, so male authority is re-established in the nick of time. And he marries her while they are stranded on the moon, so '50s family sensibilities are fully protected. I wish that Coronel Briteis was given a role in which she was depicted as competent instead of petulant. That would have made this movie brilliant and way, way ahead of its time. As it is the movie can be awkward to watch. But if Project Moonbase has any claim to fame, it has Donna Martell, the sexiest rocket girl of the '50s.",
         "The plot of Project Moon Base is fairly simple \u0096 Colonel Briteis is selected to pilot a rocket on a lunar orbit in preparation of an upcoming lunar landing. It's simple enough until it is discovered that an enemy agent is on board with intentions of sabotaging the mission. So whether their superiors like it or not, Colonel Briteis and Major Moore aren't going to be able to complete their mission. They're going to have to try to land on the moon. Many of the comments you'll see on Project Moon Base focus a lot of attention on the movie's treatment or portrayal of women. Is the movie sexist? Those who argue against it mention Colonel Briteis' (Briteis is a female) position on the space voyage or the fact that the President is a woman. Well so what? Project Moon Base is as sexist as they come. I pointed out some of the sexist comments in Rocketship X-M and that movie's got nothing on Project Moon Base. From the intentional mispronunciation of Colonel Briteis name (Bright Eyes \u0096 yeah, right) to General Greene's threat to give Briteis a spanking to Briteis' incapability of fixing the radio after several hours of trying when Major Moore is able to do it in mere seconds \u0096 it's about as sexist as I've seen. Sure, it was made in a different time, so don't take my comments as a slam. I'm just pointing out the facts as I see them. Two things I'm glad to have discovered about Project Moon Base. First, the movie was originally meant to be a television serial. That goes a long way to explaining some of the disjointed scenes and fragmented story lines. Second, many of the props and costumes were also used in Cat Women of the Moon. I thought they seemed awfully familiar. Glad to know I'm not going crazy. Overall, Project Moon Base is a fairly dull programmer with little to hold the attention of the viewer. There aren't any real action scenes and any suspense or drama never materializes. Even by 1953 standards, the special effects had to feel weak and not awfully convincing. Finally, much of the plot is handled rather awkwardly. The notion of an enemy agent infiltration the space program might have been interesting, but here it comes off as just too stupid for words. As is the case with many of the films I watch, there is another hand. So, on the other hand, Project Moon Base is too enjoyable despite the numerous flaws for me to rate it as a stinker. Donna Martell gives Colonel Briteis an infectious nature that's hard not to enjoy. She's a pleasure to watch. Some of the goofy sight gags are almost charming in their naïveté. Take the scenes on the space station where people walk on the ceiling or the chairs on the wall. Stupid, sure \u0096 but fun nonetheless. Finally, there's a real innocence to most everything in Project Moon Base that's often sorely missing from today's movies that I can appreciate. Take the ending of the film where Colonel Briteis is forced to marry Major Bill Moore so people won't talk. And, even though the attitudes of the filmmakers may have been chauvinistic, most of it is harmless enough. Maybe I'm living in the past, but I sort of enjoyed Project Moon Base.",
         "An enemy agent sneaks himself on board the first circum-Luna space flight and, when he is discovered, forces the rest of the crew (all two of them) to make the first landing on the moon. Shortly thereafter he gets himself conveniently killed and the other two members have to get married because apart from anything else they are 250,000 miles from earth - without a chaperon! (Did I mention they were a man and a woman with a history who hated each other on sight? Well they were and they did.) For a movie with almost no plot and even less in the way of characters it is remarkably well thought-out in the technical department. Phones in the near future of 1953 were still huge clunking great black Bakelite things with dials on the front, but they had dinky little aerials on hand set and receiver which meant characters could walk about the room talking without a string getting in the way. Like yeah! I mean how likely is that?? There's all sorts of stuff that technically is far above most of the other SF dross of the period: the ship that takes our crew from Earth up to the space station is streamlined but the one that makes the trip to the moon looks like a pile of tin cans taped together. This was 1953, sixteen years before 2001 introduced the concept that spaceships didn't have to look like a torpedo with wings to a wider audience. And in the space station, where everyone was weightless and walked about using magnetic boots,I loved the notice that said: 'Please, Do Not Walk On The Walls' (it was painted upside-down on the other side of the corridor for the benefit of people walking on the ceiling). This movie also contained the best non special effect I have seen for ages. Towards the end, our hero (on the Moon) is in conference with his boss, The General, (on Earth) via the huge wall to wall Enterprise-like TV screen. Our hero paces back and forth his control room. The General on Earth sits behind his desk and talks to him man to man. Every time our hero walks past the screen, his shadow falls across the General's desk revealing the fact that the actor playing the General is merely sat the other side of a big hole in the set's wall, delivering his half of the conversation to an imaginary camera somewhere in the middle distance, while doing a heroic job of ignoring the other actor in the room with him. A very long 63 minutes; most of which was spent waiting for the heroine's rather peachy, hot-pant clad bum to appear again.",
         "Failed TV show becomes a wildly uneven feature film about a space station and misdirected space shot becoming the first moonbase. Weird mix of comedy, drama and science fiction with more than a dash of (unnamed) anti-communist propaganda doesn't seem sure what it wants to be. Worse you don't know whether you're supposed to laugh at or with the film. The mere fact that this was an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 in its early days gives you an idea about how odd the film is. Its regrettably not very good and there's a good chance you'll end up turning the film off before the ending. Robert Heinlein was unhappy with the finished product because the TV show he worked on was changed against his wishes. Looking at the film and guessing what he actually had a hand in, I'm pretty sure that the evil \"red\" plot is his, I think that the film would still be quite silly- especially in retrospect. For bad film lovers or Heinlein completeists only.",
         "This is a very odd sci-fi movie from the 1950s because those involved really tried very hard to make the movie plausible and set it in the near future. Instead of bug-eyed aliens, this film concerns the American space program and our attempt to go to the moon. Interestingly enough, in some ways the film wasn't too far off--indicating we'd have a working space station and were almost ready to attempt a moon landing in 1970 (whereas we were on the moon in 1969 and put a space station up just a few years later). Time and again, details were important and the film, at times, looked more like a government training film. However, when it came to plot, the movie really fell apart. First, while they were never called \"Communists\", the space program was attacked and infiltrated by \"enemies\" bent on destroying it. This was pretty topical for the time, but was executed very crudely and made little sense. The whole side story involving the professor who was replaced with an enemy agent was stupidly executed and made no sense--particularly later in the film once they were stranded on the moon--his behaviors made absolutely no sense at all. Second, while the film at times tried to be very egalitarian when it came to gender (such as making the President and the first pilot of the moon shot women), the film was so sexist and stupid when it came to the lead female character, Colonel Briteis (pronounced \"Bright Eyes\"). While described as competent and efficient, most of the time throughout the film she seemed to be a dip-stick with a bad case of PMS! Plus, she seemed to be picked for the film just because she looked good in shorts and a t-shirt (the standard garb for astronauts in the film). My wife just cringed at her character and I found it to be unintentionally funny. Plus, the Major, who you KNEW was destined to marry her, was an annoying sexist who only seemed happy when he was not serving under her (forgive the crude humor) but was her superior in rank! Uggh. The film just died when it came to the human interactions and became tedious and silly. So, although I love the sci-fi genre of the 1950s, I must admit this film is fatally flawed. Under no circumstances should it be viewed by a rabid feminist, as it might result in an apoplectic fit at the sexism and stupidity of the characters. Otherwise, watch at your own risk."
