         "content": "After World War 2 the Disney studio had difficulty getting back to where they were prior to the war's disruptive affects on the studio's operations. Having said that, they produced what they called \"Package Features\", which contained multiple stories rather than just one feature, as was the case with \"Snow White\", \"Pinocchio\", and \"Fantasia\", prior to the war. \n\nThis one, \"Fun And Fancy Free\", uses 2 story lines that were in development prior to the American declaration of War, in December of 1941. \"Mickey & the Beanstalk\", pictured on the cover, plus \"Bongo\" the 'Circus Bear'. 2 films that weren't fleshed out sufficiently to be a feature, on their own, but put together with Edgar Bergman and his act for narrative and time filling purposes. I have this and the others in this series on DVD for children and grandchildren, but this isn't Disney's best effort. There are special features on some of both the Video & DVD editions which does make the \"Package Feature\" worthwhile.\n\nOther \"Package Features\" include, \"Melody Time\", \"Make Mine Music\", \"Three Caballeros\", \"The Adventures of Ichabod & Mr. Toad\". All produced in the late 1940s and having somewhat pieced together though highly watchable formats made to suit a young audience.",

         "[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Jiminy Cricket goes about his large library, feeling fun and fancy free. He has a run-in with a giant cat, not to mention a doll and a teddy bear. He notices the bear and doll's expressions seem glum, so he decides to put a musical story on the phonograph (record player). The story is called \"Bongo\", and is told and sung by Dinah Shore. It was about three bears, but no Goldilocks. These were different bears. The story revolves around a young circus bear named Bongo. Bongo was the star attraction at the circus. The fans simply loved him. But unfortunately, his keepers did not. After every show, they slapped the cuffs on him and threw him into his cage. This was no way to live. One day while the circus train was heading to the next town, Bongo heard this voice calling him. It was telling him to break free and live free. So Bongo successfully broke free from his cage and, on his unicycle, rode into the picturesque Bambi forest. He encounters squirrels, chipmunks, and all sorts of animals. At first, Bongo tries to climb a tree unsuccessfully, causing his new animal friends to laugh at him. Bongo didn't get much sleep that night due to a loud caterpillar. Well, Bongo found that the new free life was anything but pleasant. But that would all change the next day. The next day, Bongo unsuccessfully tries to catch a fish, and then he sees HER. A cute little girl bear that Bongo instantly falls in love with. Her name was Lulubell. Things were going great for them until a large, giant, mean bear named Lumpjaw came along. He wanted Lulubell for himself, so he knocked Bongo about. But Lulubell came to his side and showed her love for him by giving him a slap. Bongo did not understand. Lumpjaw fell instantly in love when Lulubell accidentally slapped him instead. See, that is how bears express their love: with a slap on the face. Well, now Bongo felt even worse than he did before. He decided to get Lulubell back. But Lumpjaw put up quite a fight, throwing boulders and swinging trees. But luckily he swung himself right down a water fall with Bongo in tow. Luckily Bongo was caught on a ledge, while Lumpjaw fell into the river below. He was carried away with the stream and was never seen again. Bongo was a hero. He and Lulubell lived happily ever after. Back to the present, Jiminy Cricket learns of a party being thrown by Charlie McCarthy, Mortimer Snerd, and Edgar Bergen- whom Jiminy had never heard of. So Jiminy decides to attend the party. Bergen, McCarthy and Snerd were entertaining a little girl, Luana. Edgar Bergen then tells them all the story of a place called Happy Valley. It was called that because everyone and everything that lived there was always very happy. This was all because of a magic harp who would sing a beautiful song everyday. But unfortunately, one fateful day, a dark shadow was cast over the land. The magic harp was stolen! Well Happy Valley was no longer happy. Crops dried out, so did the river. And three local peasants, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy faced starvation. Donald could take no more and tried to butcher their only posession: a cow. But Mickey thought it would be wiser to sell the cow in order to buy food. Unfortunately all Mickey got for the cow were some magic beans, which Donald instantly threw away. But that night, a large beanstalk began growing under the house which carried it and its three occupants up above the clouds. Mickey, Donald and Goofy awakened to see a giant castle in a giant land. But once they entered, they saw something that set their hearts aglow: giant food! They dug in. But with all this giant stuff around, there had to be a giant PERSON that lived there. And sure enough, the giant came home! Willie the Giant had the magic power to turn himself into anything. Mickey decided to trick Willie into turning into a fly so they could swat him. But Willie was wise to them. He locked Donald and Goofy in a box, but luckily Mickey escaped and found the magic harp that had been stolen from the valley. So while she sang Willie to sleep, Mickey swiped the key to the box, and so Donald, Goofy and the harp made for the beanstalk. But Willie woke up then and tried to grab Mickey, who flew out on a champagne cork. They rushed down the beanstalk and began sawing it down. They did it! The beanstalk fell, and Willie the Giant fell...CRASH!! Back to the present, Mortimer Snerd was sad over the death of the giant, but Bergen explained that the giant was fictitious and wasn't real. Just then, Willie the Giant looked in and asked if anybody had seen Mickey. Bergen fainted. And so ends Walt Disney's 9th animated masterpiece! I feel it was very well done, just like all their other brilliantly animated and live action features. This one features the celebrity talents of Edgar Bergen and Dinah Shore. And featuring the voices of Cliff Edwards as Jiminy, Clarence Nash as Donald Duck, Walt Disney as Mickey (for the last time), Pinto Colvig as Goofy, and Billy Gilbert as Willie. Sadly, nobody from this film are alive today, but I'm sure at the time they knew that had a true gem established. Seeing \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\" brought back alot of memories from when I used to watch it as a kid. So if you're in the mood for a funny, touching musical in the Disney tradition, then do see Fun and Fancy Free today! Back in the days when animation actually meant something! I recommend it!! First class!! -",
         "The duo of Disney and RKO continue the magic onto 1947 with this flick, \"Fun and Fancy Free.\" In it are a couple of wonderful and terrific stories: \"Bongo,\" and \"Mickey and the Beanstalk.\" Again, this movie has everything that you would expect in a Disney classic. Also, look out for more great Disney friends, like Jiminy Cricket!!!!! One interesting fact: did you know that Walt Disney, the man who created Mickey, was the voice of Mickey Mouse? In \"Mickey and the Beanstalk,\" Walt Disney himself voiced as Mickey Mouse, and that would end up being his last cartoon to do so. So, this shows that movies like this just aren't made anymore. (sniff) But still, watch this movie with your children, enjoy it, and have a whole lot of fun with \"Fun and Fancy Free!!!!!\" 10 out of 10 stars.",
         "Fun and Fancy Free is for me one of Disney's lesser efforts, but is still very charming, simple and enjoyable. I did think the live action sequences were dated though, and the film is quite short. Out of all the characters, the only character I didn't care for that much was the puppet. Apart from the hilarious \"well she used to be a good milker, but now... she is an udder failure\" he didn't really make an impact on me. Maybe it was because the ventriloquism was rather substandard. However, I really enjoyed this on the whole. The introduction with Jiminy Cricket- voiced by the one and only Cliff Edwards- in the library was very effective, as was a vast majority of the script. The animation is stunning, and by far the best aspect of the movie, and I hope I am not the only person who found the songs beautiful and memorable, my favourite being \"My what a happy day\". There are two mini-classics here, Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk. Both are wonderful gems, but I will admit I do prefer the latter. Bongo tells the rather simple story of the adorable Bongo and his endeavour into a world he has never known before, after being the star attraction of a circus. It is very sweet and well meaning, and the narration isn't so bad either. Mickey and the Beanstalk is a favourite of mine. Wonderful voice acting, terrific animation especially for the beanstalk and nice music made this memorable for me. Other things that impressed were one Jiminy Cricket of course, well how can he not impress, he is a classic character in the history of animation? Two, I thought Edgar Bergen was very entertaining in this film asides from the ventriloquism, and also child actress Luana Patten was impressive. All in all, one of Disney's lesser efforts, but has undeniable charm due to the animated segments and Cricket himself. 7/10 Bethany Cox",
         "If you ask me, I think Walt Disney put into this movie more of his cheerful, laid-back nature than any other and I haven't even seen a possible making-of featurette to prove because, currently, I only have this on video which is at least 7 years old now. I think it's fair to say that \"Fun and Fancy Free\" is exactly what it says on the tin. It opens with a lively chorus singing the title song and I love how when the animations begins to start up the song follows onto Jiminy Cricket (voiced by Cliff Edwards, died 1971, (I think) at 76) singing his own verses, a laid-back, cheerful happy fellow riding on a large leaf in what soon appears to be a vase. In order to cheer up a sad doll missing her mama and a moody teddy Jiminy puts on a vinyl record telling a story... BONGO: The expressive, vivacious and energetic enthusiasm of narrator Dinah Shore is just unbelievable! Bongo, a former circus bear who had been mistreated by the ring-master, longs to be free and eventually gets his dream! He is befriended by all the forest animals and also falls in love - but will things go smoothly? Give you a clue; \"Every deer and every dove has a way of making love but a bear likes to say it with a SLAP\" MICKEY AND THE BEANSTALK: Jiminy finds an invitation to a party across the way and here's who was there; Luana Patten (died 1996, just 57) the hilariously cheeky Charlie McCarthy, the dazed and absent-minded Mortimer Snerd and the man who threw the party Edgar Bergen (died 1978, 75). Edgar Bergen tries to tell a story (in spite of his frustration at Charlie's frequent interruptions and criticisms) of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy living in poverty leaving Mickey and Goofy miserable and Donald having some violent fits of psychotic rage. Bergen defends him to the end. What about the others? Mickey and Goofy went through it too and they didn't try to murder the family cow! The only way to bring happiness to their home is to fetch an enchanted harp from the castle of a selfish giant but it's an not easy mission because if you can fool Willie the giant you can fool anyone! Can they do it? Mortimer becomes upset at when finally became of the giant and as Edgar tries to comfort him the roof is suddenly torn off by... the giant. Not to eat them but to just pop in. This cartoon musical extravaganza truly did make history in animation; that eye-popping blend of art and live action has been done practically throughout the entire movie. And there's neither bad language nor sex scenes nor violence - just full of Fun and Fancy Free!",
         "This is a good combination of two animated stories/shorts: Bongo and Micky and the Beanstalk. while watching a mixture of stories and a mixture of animation and live action was a little awkward, Jiminy Cricket held it together. This film's latest release on video gives everyone the opportunity to see this tiny treasure for the first time. While, it doesn't rank up with the Best of Disney's animation, it is still worth seeing, if nothing else for Walt Disney's last film as the voice of Mickey.",
         "The 9th animated Disney classic is something I have mixed feelings about, in similarity to what happens with \"The Three Caballeros\". It's a curious cartoon with some to offer, yet not one of Disney's finest creations. For one thing, I like its introduction. I was surprised when I heard a familiar singing voice. I thought «This voice sounds like Jiminy Cricket». And in the next moment, Jiminy Cricket appears, voiced by the same Cliff Edwards. Another interesting fact is that Jiminy Cricket is the narrator of the story in some parts. He introduces us the first of the two stories, \"Bongo\": it is the story of a little circus bear that runs away from the circus and discovers what it's like to be free. I liked the story of Bongo and the character itself. He's a cute and adorable little bear. This is, without a doubt, the best segment of this motion picture. It is, however, narrated by Dinah Shore. As for the second and final segment, \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\", it is narrated by Edgar Bergen, but before that there are a few live-action scenes where Edgar Bergen is working as a ventriloquist and tells the tale to child actress Luana Patten. After the end of the story, there are a few more live-action scenes like this and Jiminy Cricket appears in both. As for the segment itself, needless to say it is based on \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". It's not a bad segment, but honestly I found it nothing special. It features, however, well known cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy. It also features Willie, the famous temperamental giant from some Disney tales. Mickey Mouse is voiced by Walt Disney himself, while Donald Duck is voiced by the inimitable Clarence Nash.",
         "Well, this is yet another in the line-up of Disney movies during this period made up of a few separate shorts surrounded by framing material. We have a musical number from Jiminy Cricket that was intended to be used in Pinocchio but was ultimately dropped. Then there's \"Bongo\", a musical tale all about a circus bear who finds himself falling in love with a wild bear he meets in a forest. But he doesn't understand the meaning of her actions when she slaps him. And last, but by no means least, we have the superb \"Mickey And The Beanstalk\" - a Disney take on the classic tale that I have seen before, as a standalone cartoon (a much preferred way to view the thing, in my opinion). While most of the material here is enjoyable enough, it's not really the classic stuff that most fans feel everyone must see. The opening musical number by Jiminy Cricket is cute and enjoyable but it really just serves to link in to the story of \"Bongo\", which is really a bit of a damp squib. The characters aren't endearing enough and the style veers between the good, the bad and the ugly (and, of course, the recycled). The second half is where everything picks up but even this is not without negatives, mainly the live-action framing device for the tale - a creepy bit of interaction between Edgar Bergen, two of his dummies and a young girl. It's unfunny, unnerving and ends up contributing to a narration to the animated fairytale adaptation that proves quite irritating. There were four directors on this one, and numerous writers, so it is yet another animated movie best left to be discussed based on what's on the screen. In that regard, this isn't a bad time-filler at all. It has a number of things dragging it down but still manages to pull itself to a position of just above average.",
         "This package film from the Disney studio is simple but just irresistible as it features two colorful and cute cartoons interwoven with Edger Bergen and his famous dummies Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd. The first segment is \"Bongo\" based on a short story by Sinclair Lewis. With the exception of narrator Dinah Shore, the whole thing is dialog free and although it moves along at a leisurely pace, it is good enough for the kids but adults will most certainly squirm. The next segment is \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\" which has Bergan doing the narration of the classic fairy tale starring Mickey, Donald and Goofy as they face Willie the Giant (voiced amusingly by Billy Gilbert). Although the cartoon is cute and amusing, Bergen and his dummies along with the adorable Luana Patten provide the bulk of the laughs. I can't help but compare the approach in this segment to \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" because of the good-natured riffing done by Charlie and Mortimer. It makes you wish that Walt Disney had used this formula for other films like \"Alice in Wonderland\" or \"Cinderella.\" It goes without saying that Charlie's riffing on Bergen's storytelling is a particular highlight. I say see this film. It'll warm your heart and keep you amused. Plus, it doesn't have the blatant pop culture jokes you get in contemporary animated films.",
         "I watched this as a kid and every time I see it I just get taken back to when everything was more simple,and beautiful. Great animation, and message. Thank you Disney you made my childhood what it is today.It really should be respected higher. It is classic. The songs, the characters. Even still toady I still sing Goofy's song. And Bongo the circus bear. So much character and nothing said at all. One of Disney's best and should be on IMDb's top 250. And the ending with the Giant and coming through the roof I was so terrified of that when I saw that as a child. The ventriloquism was great to, that little girl was good as well I wonder who she was.... 10/10",
