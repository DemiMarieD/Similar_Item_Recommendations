When April covers the cleanup process underway in the city by TGRI, Splinter recognizes the initials from the canister of mutagen that turned them all into mutants. Meanwhile, the Shredder is alive and well, has resumed command of the Foot, and seeks revenge upon Splinter and his students. Upon learning of the potential for the ooze to mutate animals into minions, he sets out to obtain samples and scientists, kidnapping Professor David Perry of TGRI and forcing him to assist in the creation of two aressive mutants to be his own pupils: Tokka (a snapping turtle) and Rahzar (a wolf). When the Turtles are discovered in April's apartment by Keno, the pizza delivery boy, they reveal their history and Keno tells them about the reborn Foot Clan's efforts to recruit people with fighting ability. Seeing the potential to infiltrate the Foot, Keno offers to sign up but Splinter refuses to put him in danger and believes that they ought to get out of April's apartment instead. Not willing to simply let the Foot Clan regroup, Rafael abandons the others during their search to team up with Keno while his brothers stumble upon an abandoned Subway Station under the city. Professor Perry manages to contaminate the mutagen to ensure that Tokka and Rahzar will not grow intelligent as a result of the mutation in addition to growing. Shredder is persuaded not to kill them by the professor due to their incredible strength (which is greater than anything exhibited by Splinter's pupils). Ironically, they imprint upon the Shredder as their mother. After infiltrating the Foot, Raphael discovers that the Shredder is alive only to be caught and used as bait. Keno gets word to the others and they try to save him from the Foot's base in the junkyard. There they are caught in a well laid trap. Master Splinter saves them and they fight the Foot and Shredder's mutants in an effort to escape with Professor Perry. They make it back to the home in the old Subway where Perry reveals everything he knows to his new friends. Donatello and Perry begin workin on an anti-mutagen when April sends word that the Shredder intends to let them loose on a rampage in Central Park if the Turtles fail to show at a fight to the death at a local construction sight. The Turtles, armed with anti-mutagen doughnuts, face Toka and Razar and the fight spreads to a local nightclub where they interupt a performance by Vanilla Ice and Ninja Rap is born. The doughnuts do the trick and the Turtles again confront the Shredder, who reveals his plans to create more mutants. When he exposes himself to the ooze, he mutates into Super Shredder and trys to bury them all but ends up killing himself instead.",

         "Good times once again as we return with our turtles in a half shell, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze is the popular sequel to the very popular and successful movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We had some minor changes to this film, while the first movie was a success, parents complained of it's dark nature and mild cursing. So this film was a little brighter and family friendly, while it drug the film down a little for some odd reason I still loved this movie. Not only me but some of my other friends loved it as well, I don't know if it's because we grew up with this film or whatever, but we still have so much fun watching it despite it's cheesy themes and the fact that Vanilla Ice makes a cameo with the ever infamous Ninja Rap that he knew the lyrics and dance too before he even knew the song existed. The Turtles have been forced to live with their friend the news reporter April O'Neil because the Foot Clan know the whereabouts of their lair in the sewers. While the Turtles are looking for a new home, they encounter a pizza delivery boy named Keno, who is trying to fight off a band of robbers by means of his skill as a martial artist, where the Turtles intervene on his behalf. The Foot Clan, no longer as large as it was in the first film, have retreated to a large junkyard, where Master Tatsu, Shredder's second in command, attempts to take control of the gang, but is challenged by Shredder himself. Shredder was thought to be dead. He now appears physically deformed and obsessed with obtaining revenge, to achieve which he sends a Foot member to pose as an intern at the news network and trail April. April is shown making a report on the efforts of an industrial organization known as TGRI to neutralize pollutants that have resulted from their experiments. Splinter, seeing the report on television, shows the Turtles and April the canister of \"ooze\" that had caused himself and the Turtles to mutate into their present forms, revealing that it was made by the TGRI. The Turtles infiltrate the TGRI offices to seize a sample of the ooze, only to encounter Tatsu and the Foot. Despite the Turtles' efforts to stop them, Tatsu and the Foot escape, taking the last canister of ooze and Professor Jordan Perry with them. Shredder later instructs Perry to use the ooze to transform a snapping turtle and a wolf into monsters, creating the characters Tokka and Rahzar. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze is silly and over the top, but it's still a really fun movie and has all the action and good times the first one had. I absolutely loved the scene where the turtles try to trick Tokka and Rahzar with the donuts, inside the donuts are the cure to make them small again, but of course they don't fall for it after a while and the turtles have the butts handed back to them, big time. I also love the little flaw where the last film Shredder is crushed in a garbage truck, he comes back to life, but he becomes super Shredder where nothing should kill him at all, except for a bridge that falls on him and the turtles, but the turtles manage to survive, lol. It's all good though, this is just a fun movie and I'll always watch it, besides you have to keep that Ninja Rap alive. 7/10",
         "The sequel to the smash hit 1990 TMNT, starts off greatly with an introduction to a new character (Keno) and has a great pizza scene showing how the city loves New York pizza as well as metaphorically showing the viewers watching that this indeed is a turtles movie...The opening music is great and is perfect for the city scene. The plot is not as well thought out as the original but still does the turtles a good name for them...I still feel they rushed it a little seeing that the movie was in production right after the 1st movie went into theaters...I seem to feel the super shredder was the turning point in the franchise, meaning that it went from a sort of Tim Burtan feel with TMNT 1, and ended up with a corny kid focused feeling with the introduction of the super shredder..and the ninja rap didn't help either..all though I thought it was cool....I just wished secret of the ooze was more of a dark TMNT movie....which the 1st movie held on to strong. The addition of Professor Jorden Perry and the whole TGRI company was a great idea to explain the chemical spill and the mutation the turtles went through. His mature nature and serious tone helped the movie maintain a sense of maturity as well as stability in the plot. The acting was great in this one as well and the comedy was just as good as in the first movie. Although Corey Feldman did not voice Donetello in this one, the replaced voice actor was great...I even might say that the actor that voiced Don in TMNT 2 is just as good as Cory Feldman's voice acting in the 1st and 3rd movie. IN conclusion, TMNT: Secret of the Ooze is a great sequel that is both funny as well as serious and is a great movie for any age. The only thing that bothered me was that is was slightly too focused on the youth audience and didn't stay 100% with the original's dark atmosphere.",
         "The fearsome foursome turtles go after the glowing cannister that mutated them as babies. While the turtles are trying to find the meaning of their lives and the ooze is slipped into the hands of the evil Shredder (Francois Chau). Shredder asks the help of an unwillingly scientist (David Warner) to make his mutant allies, Rahzar and Tokka. The Turles seeks help with the young pizza deliver boy-Keno (Ernie Reyes, Jr.). The Heroes dive into action and of course, Pizza! Directed by Michael Pressman (Doctor Detroit, Some Kind of Hero, To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday) made an entertaining sequel. This is a bigger budgeted film than the first movie. As usual, the highlight is the animatronic characters by Jim Henson's creature shop. The plot of the sequel is extremely silly but never boring. Paige Turco replaced Judith Hoag from the original and Turco is appealing in the film. Too Bad, Elias Koteas didn't return for the sequel and Corey Feldman didn't return to voice Donatello also. The film was a hit like the original. The only flaw in the sequel is the ending, which it is a mess. Rapper:Vanilla Ice appears in a embarrassing cameo. This sequel is amusing for the kids and fun for the fans of the comic book series. (*** ¬Ω/*****).",
         "This film opens with tremendous confidence and energy. The humor of the Turtles may be so 1990 but I still dig it. The opening scene in the shopping mall is way funny and a great way to introduce is to the sequel. At the time the style of the Turtles wasn't so stale, so the plot may seem a bit childish or dumb now. I have no doubts that if this movie were made today it would not be subtitled 'The Secret of the Ooze'. One can hardly expect high art from a movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II but they could have subtitled it something a little less crass. Apparently taking place right after the first movie (where's Casey) it wastes no time bringing back the Shredder and the rest of the Foot Clan. This time Shredder aims to steal the cannister of ooze that mutated our heroes so he can make his own monsters to avenge his defeat. The result is Tokka and Rahzar and it seems like a half-attempt at a live-action version of Rocksteady and Bebop. As you can imagine, this plot isn't very clever. But the movie never really lulls so long as our heroes are on screen. Look out for a cameo by Vanilla Ice (looking alarmingly like Dolph Lundgren) at the end. It's so dated it may be difficult to watch but as long as your alone you won't have to cringe. The DVD has wonderful motion menus as well as a great 1.85:1 anamorphic picture with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras are thin but still it's a great buy.",
         "STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs The turtles have thwarted the evil Shredder and his army of ninja thieves and are now searching for a new home.However,it soon emerges The Shredder is set to return to wreak more havoc,and has the ways and the means of unleashing a terrible new threat to the crime fighting awesome foursome.As they set out to stop him,the turtles come to learn more about where they came from and the secrets of their origin... At the time of the original film's release,the TV series and the toys were at the height of their popularity and so a feature film was inevitable.However,it was a relatively low budget Golden Harvest production that went on to become the most successful independent film of all time.GH still played quite a huge part in the proceedings with this second instalment,however the first film had been a major success,a sequel was as inevitable as the original adaptation that preceded it and so now,a worldwide big major studio like Twentieth Century Fox wanted to have a cut in the stakes and so stepped in to cash in on the franchise.And hey,nobody makes family blockbusters like Twentieth Century Fox,right?Well,maybe Universal. Anyone who would regard Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 as pointless is,in essence,unable to see past their own nose.The law of physics practically states that any successful (especially family based) action film will have a follow up,in the interests of franchising and,well,basically making money.And it's certainly the family that TMNT2 appeals more to.It's a much lighter,sillier and more family friendly feeling outing,in comparison to the dark,grimy feel of the original.The Shredder,for instance and most significantly,manages only a fraction of the dark,menacing vibe he gave last time and for the most part completely lacks substance here.There's a scene in which the Tokha and Rahzor monsters clamber up and cuddle him that forcefully strips him of all the fear and respect he commanded from the last film.To a degree,the same could be said of Tatsu,although in fairness,he did carry a slightly bumbling quality to him in the original.That's not to mention a number of woefully under-used supporting characters,such as April and Chief Sterns.And what the hell happened to Casey Jones?!? Of the new characters the new film introduces,Ernie Reyes Jr. emits a fairly engaging charisma as kung fu fighting pizza delivery boy Keno and David Warner is impressive as bumbling professor Jordan Perry (or maybe the film holds too much sentimental value for me!) One of the main compounding factors of the film (in my eyes) was the plot (or,rather,lack of it) that at best feels very slight and at worst feels practically non-existent.The film is very short,so the feeling of it all being slapped together to make money is never far in doubt.Yet,for all this,the film still manages to carry a charm all of it's own.The script,though patchily assembled,still manages to be engaging throughout and the Jim Henson creature shop creations are as well made,colourful and pleasant to the eye as you'd expect.And hey,when even a Vanilla Ice cameo can't spoil it,something has to be right.***",
         "Well, this second film was more kid-oriented and played more for laughs, but I still got a kick out of it. Paige Turco made a better April than Judith Hoag (and what a cool apartment April has!) and Ernie Reyes Jr. (whatever happened to him?) is a lot of fun to watch too. What WAS the secret of the ooze? I haven't seen the film in years! Re: Vanilla Ice. Yes, his very presence is laughable, let alone his \"performance\". But in his defense, he's less embarrassing here than in 1991's other blockbuster smash hit, Cool As Ice!",
         "There really is no point in going over everything once again for newcomers who should really watch the harmless and entertaining first movie anyway. This time around we get a new April O'Neil (Paige Turco, a vast improvement over her predecessor), no Casey Jones, a little bit of mad science, a returning Shredder, some little athletic kid who kicks people to the ground in between delivering pizza and some great enemies for the turtles to try and destroy. Oh, and as the title would suggest, there's a more prominent role for the ooze that helped make the turtles what they would become and that's the main thrust of the plot: that ooze and how it is to be used/abused by those who get their hand on it. Simplicity itself. This is, let's be frank now, not a great movie. And yet, somehow, it kept me entertained throughout and actually left me with a big grin on my face in places. Perhaps it was the familiarity of the characters, perhaps it was some of the genuinely half-decent action sequences, perhaps it was even just the excuse all these years later of STILL being able to laugh at Vanilla Ice (oh, do watch for that scene as it is priceless). Nostalgia is all well and good in small doses but, thankfully, this movie was amusing, light and entertaining enough in a standard family movie way to pass the time without too much pain. See this if you like: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Double Dragon, Tank Girl.",
         "In the early 90s, everywhere you went you'd see something related to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The craze took the country by storm and kids like you and I were nuts for it. The first feature film was both a hit at the box office and with youngsters, so it was only natural that we get a sequel, right? New Line Cinema wasted no time and the following year we were given number 2. It too was a hit, but was it even as good as the original? Some seem to think so, some even like it more. I like it, but nowhere near as much. Pros: Acting is decent. More of that corny, yet endearing humor. Moves at an OK pace. As usual the Jim Henson people did a nice job on the animatronics. Some breathtaking shots of New York City. The fight scenes are fun, plus the choreography has improved. A pretty cool final showdown. Cons: Lacks some of the energy and fun of the first. Putting everyone in the middle of a Vanilla Ice concert just dates the film. Plus much of it feels like they were trying to pad the running time. Final thoughts: This first of two sequels isn't bad, in fact it's pretty darn entertaining. But like a lot of sequels that came out a year or less after it's predecessor, it feels like it was made for money and nothing more. Still if you're a fan then it's worth seeing. My rating: 3/5",
         "Minor Spoilers I was amazed how fast this one came out!Tell you the truth I like this one the most out of all of the movies.The film is really presented well and when the Turtles show up boy is that a great scene.I just love it when Shredder returns!April is played by a different woman and there is no Bebop and Rocksteady but it has two new mutants which doesn`t fail.The end of the film is really cool.Shredder takes the ooze and becomes Super Shredder!Super Shredder is played by wrestler Kevin Nash.When I saw him I wanted to see him again and again.This is really a good movie.Its one of the best!",
         "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze has oft been described as so bad it's good. I disagree, as it fits none of the criteria: where are the horrible lines, the bad acting, the abundance of ham and cheese which makes many a bad movie hilarious? Aside from those who have nostalgia for it, Secret of the Ooze is a dull venture: the fight scenes are boring, the characters are uninteresting, and the story feels like only the bare bones of an actual script. The first TMNT movie was no masterpiece, but it was fun and sported good fight scenes, a dark atmosphere, and gave the characters actual personality. Secret of the Ooze has none of this. Due parents bewailing the violence in the first movie, the fight scenes are toned down considerably, now filled with slapstick that's both uninspired and ridiculous. The grittiness is eliminated altogether, yet the film never really has a light-hearted feel to it either, at least not in the same vein as the enjoyably goofy '87 cartoon. Everything, including the humor, just felt bland. But what really hurts the movie isn't the slapstick or goofiness: it's the characters. The turtles have become stripped of their individual personalities; each one of them is the same goofy, catchphrase-spewing person (or turtle, if we're going to be technical). Splinter is given little to do, April is given nothing to do save for looking pretty, and Shredder proves to be less threatening than even his '87 counterpart. The new characters, Keno, and the mutant duo of Tokka and Rahzar, prove to be unexciting as well. Now, I was not expecting Shakespeare here, as it is a kids' film after all and one obviously made to milk money, but I at least wanted entertainment, no matter how mindless or contrived it might be. The problem is this isn't mindless entertainment: it's just flat out boring. So, is there anything entertaining about this film? Well, Shredder's new costume is laughably bad. There's the infamous scene with Vanilla Ice doing his \"Ninja Rap\". Keno pulls off some cool moves. And... yeah, that's it. Secret of the Ooze fits the description of \"meh\": it isn't enjoyable, it isn't terrible, and it most certainly isn't bad enough to be good. It's just rushed, mediocre, and isn't likely to inspire repeat viewings."
