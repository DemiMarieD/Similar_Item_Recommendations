         "content": "I loved the first two installments of Jackie Chan's 'Police Story' series, and wish I had seen the intervening adventures of Chan's character, Inspector Chan Ka Kui, ('Police Story 3: Supercop' and 'Project S'--though this is labeled Police Story 4, it's actually his very popular character's 5th appearance). Still, the story (basically a James Bond-type role, as he is forced by his boss to help the CIA prevent a Russian nuclear device from getting into the wrong hands) stands on its own, and is thrilling from start to finish, though something tends to be different and missing from his earlier Hong Kong exploits (though this was made there and dubbed--albeit horrendously--to help make him a star Stateside). If I had to put a finger on it, I think I prefer films that Chan directed himself. It's still extremely enjoyable, with set-pieces--especially when he defends himself with a stepladder--that approach awe-inspiring choreographed action perfection...",

      "synopsis": "In this fourth 'Police Story' movie, Hong Kong 'supercop' Inspector Jackie Chan Ka-Kui (Jackie Chan) is hired by the CIA to follow leads of a nuclear smuggling case. He follows a woman named Natasha to Ukraine, when he realizes that she had been hiding vital information. When Jackie calls for backup, she is arrested. However, Natasha's partner is an unknown man, who turns out to be Tsui (Jackson Lau), a Chinese American nuclear scientist with CIA links, suspected of stealing a nuclear warhead. Jackie follows Tsui to a restricted area, and after a trap set by Tsui, CIA agents together with Ukrainian authorities engage in battle. Jackie finds a briefcase which contained evidence that Tsui had, but as he is chased by unknown forces, he loses the briefcase as he falls through a frozen lake into the freezing water. When he recovers in Russia, he meets Colonel Gregor (Yuri Petrov) who explains the situation. Jackie goes with the FSB and is taken to Moscow where he discovers he's been assigned to work with Colonel Gregor to solve a similar case involving nuclear weapons being smuggled out of Ukraine. His task is to track Tsui, who disappeared after their last encounter. Jackie is taken by a Russian submarine to Brisbane, Australia, where Tsui's attractive younger sister Annie Tsui (Annie Wu) works at an aquarium doing shark shows. Uncle 7 (Terry Woo), the Tsuis' father and the local Triad boss, is seriously ill, and Chan suspects the criminal will show up soon. Unbeknown to Jackie, Tsui is hiding at the hospital, and has given a nuclear warhead to Annie, who hides it at the aquarium. Whilst following Annie, Jackie gets to meet the aquarium animals and is kidnapped by Tsui, who claims to have a deal with Colonel Gregor. Jackie, after realizing he has been used by Gregor decides to return home, but two toughs are sent to kill him, and he is framed for the murder of Uncle 7. He attempts to clear his name by going to see Annie at the memorial hall, but he is (unsurprisingly) unwelcome, having to fight bodyguards and Tsui has to eventually rescue him. Tsui explains that Gregor caught him on a CIA assignment three years before, and forced him to turn into a triple agent: a CIA agent ostensibly turned by the FSB, but in reality serving Gregor's private criminal schemes. Annie, Jackie and Tsui decide to work together to fight Gregor. Uncle 7's elaborate Chinatown funeral then becomes the scene for a complex showdown between the various parties. Annie and Jackie attempt to retrieve the stolen warhead from the shark pool (so that they can return it to the police), but Gregor and his toughs follow them, leading to a climatic confrontation underwater. In the midsts, Gregor attacks the aquarium and shatters the aquarium glass which releases the killer shark, which makes a good diversion for him to escape. Jackie then saves the tourists and follows Gregor. While Gregor escapes with the weapon and Annie as hostage in a getaway boat, Jackie comes up with an unusual plan that allows him to recover the weapon and return it to the proper authorities, while Annie makes her escape, in which he drives and launches a display car onto the boat. Gregor and Tsui are apprehended by Australian police and turned over to Russian authorities. The case is solved, Jackie is thanked for his work by the FSB, and the film ends as he returns to Hong Kong. As is usual in Jackie Chan's films, out-takes (generally accidents involving the star) are shown under the closing titles.",

         "In \"Jing cha gu shi IV: Jian dan ren wu\" (called \"Jackie Chan's First Strike\" in the US), Jackie Chan has to find a missing nuclear warhead. Of course, if you pay too much attention to the plot, you'll miss the rest of the movie. Like any of Chan's movies, the point is to have him kick ass in various and sundry ways. The snowboarding sequence in my opinion should get registered alongside Gene Kelly singing in the rain as one of the great cinematic moments. And the ladder? I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DOES IT, BUT HE DOES IT!!!!!!!! So just have fun watching this (and I guarantee that you will). You could be deaf and still get a kick out of it.",
         "If you've never seen a Jackie Chan film before, this is a good place to start. I speak from experience, for it is the first film of his that I saw. I must warn you, though: his films are not for everyone. The plots are often pedestrian and sometimes incoherent. They also are usually dubbed, making them seem cheesy. Sometimes I describe him to people as a guilty pleasure, but that may give the wrong impression. What Chan does well is sheer genius. Plot is besides the point. It's not what his films are about. What, then, are they about? It's hard to put into words. You may have heard him described as a martial artist, a stuntman, and a slapstick comedian. None of those descriptions do him justice. I could add that he's something of an acrobat and gymnast, but even that doesn't sum it up. There is no actor he can be compared to, for his style is unique; it's like he's developed his own art form. These are not \"fighting films\" in a traditional sense. They're more like the types of acts you might see at a circus, involving props used in astonishing ways and depending on careful choreography and exquisite timing. For example, at one point in this film Chan flips and twirls a heavy stepladder like it was a baton, then sets it down and weaves his own body through the rungs, while fending off attacks from a group of men. Typically in his films, the acts he performs get increasingly formidable as the film progresses, culminating in some large-scale stunt such as him leaping off a building. But even the little things he does are eye-popping. In this film he's constantly climbing walls with an agility reminiscent of Donald O'Connor. You never know what to expect, for he does different things in each film. Well, at least that once was the case. Since \"Rush Hour,\" his 1998 American blockbuster, his stunts have become less intricate, and he's begun repeating ideas. It may be that he's getting older, but it also may be that he's moved from Hong Kong to Hollywood. Undoubtedly the recent films have more polish and better production values, which has helped make them accessible to a wider audience. But his earlier work is so full of invention that I'm able to overlook formula plots, bad acting, and cheesy humor. I do have my limits. A few of his films--\"The Protector\" comes to mind--are so badly done that it doesn't matter that they have cool fight sequences. His films need some measure of competence to work. They are more than a series of routines strung together. Part of what makes them charming is Chan himself. He is a pretty solid actor compared to some of the leading American action stars, capable of conveying a full range of emotions convincingly. He is particularly good at expressing panic. The character he plays is not your standard tough-guy. He is frequently an inferior fighter to those he confronts. When hit, he grimaces in pain. When faced with the opportunity, he runs. He survives by a mixture of quick wits and luck. He is far more a throwback to Keaton and Chaplin than a martial arts master. Of course, I won't call this film or any other by Chan a masterpiece. Perhaps I'm too conventional. If the purpose of films is to entertain, his succeed brilliantly. Whether they appeal to you depends on your taste, but one thing you cannot do is claim he's untalented. It may not be a talent you're used to, but it's one that's likely to remain unparalleled.",
         "The fourth installment in Jackie Chan's terrific Police Story films {although the western release obscured the connection,but more on that later}is basically Chan's take on James Bond. And it is tremendous fun,in many respects one of his best all-round movies. While having some incredible action,it also has a reasonably good plot and acting,two things which even the most die-hard Chan fan will probably admit his films don't often contain. The film has been unfairly criticised for having little martial arts,but it has more than,say,Crime Story or The Tuxedo. This film aims at more diversity in it's action,and ranges from a ski-chase {ending with Chan jumping on to a helicopter than falling into ice-filled water with VERY little protection}to a running battle with a giant {this scene actually has Chan running on water!}to a warehouse fight where Chan uses a ladder with amazing skill. The film moves a little slower than you might expect but the story holds the attention and the last half-hour is incredible non-stop action,climaxing with a terrific car stunt. The centrepiece is an underwater fight with martial arts moves. It somewhat degenerates into clowning but is never less than terrific to watch. A shame that Chan injured himself and therefore {as with Rumble In The Bronx}could not have a final battle,but never mind. Hugely enjoyable then,with Chan obviously aware of the Bondisms and having fun doing them his way {he even complains that he is missing the gorgeous girls at one point}. Sadly the Western cinema release is cut by around 20 minutes. The plot is harder to follow and ,worst of all,some of the action is cut,including some great moments from the underwater battle. The original Hong Kong version is superior in every way and it remains a great shame that New Line and Miramax see fit to chop up all the non-American Chan films they release. Seek out the full version.",
         "In this apparent 'Police Story IV', Jackie plays, of all people, Jackie, a cop from Hong Kong working on a case with the CIA. Pretty soon he is off to Ukraine, and then to Australia for some reason. In Australia, he shares a hotel room with a Koala, and generally beats up very big Russian mobsters. Wow. OK, I'll admit it isn't as awesome as it sounds, nor is it as bad as it may sound to others. The plot is standard spy-stuff, and accompanied by some very poor dialog. The bad guys are the stereotypical bad guys who know they can kill the hero straight away, but opt for something else, in this case, its \"lets have fun with him\" or \"lets beat him\". Ah, classic. Those very big Russian mobsters don't look or sound very intelligent anyway. Sure, the plot might be trying to be too much like James Bond, the dialog bad, and some of the actors poor - but Jackie beats people up using a ladder. A LADDER! Some of the other action scenes are pretty cool too - ranging from Jackie snowboarding, to Jackie fighting on stilts, to Jackie jumping cars. Awesome. 7/10 - Only for fans of action or Jackie Chan",
         "FIRST STRIKE packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and double agents from CIA and KGB . This exciting story about the cop named Chang Wing of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Chang participates in a sting operation against an international spy-ring that is smuggling nuclear weapons from Ukraine. But when one of them (Tsui) escapes , Jackie is ordered to capture him . This leads Jackie all over the globe beginning with Tsui's sister (Annie Wu) at Australia . The story follows him as he attempts to stay alive and chase the villain. When his police buddies are deceived by a wicked criminal band , Wing turns into an unfortunate spy when he is also double-crossed . A young woman helps him to track down and apprehend the gang commanded by a double agent. Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game. This exciting movie is crammed of action-packed, overwhelming stunt-work and lots of violence but with humor. Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fake-shots . Awesome ,incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than its predecessor . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include a stirring pursuit on the snow and underwater fights surrounded by sharks in James Bond style , among others . This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . However while the former outings Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and fine action stars in their own right , like Maggie Cheung and Michelle Khan , at this film his parternaire is unknown . Thrilling and moving musical score fitting to action by J. Peter Robinson . The picture is lavishly produced by the great Asian producers Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and efficiently directed by Stanley Tong . The first version titled ¨Police story(1985)¨ directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was ¨Police story 2(1988)¨ also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches . It's followed by ¨Police story V : Crime story¨ and finally ¨New Police story¨ by Benny Chan . Rating : Accepatable and passable, the picture has its sensational moments here and there , mostly provided by its agile star, the super Jackie Chan .",
         "This is my favorite of all the movies released theatrically in America with Jackie Chan. Police Story 4 is my favorite out of the Police Story series, and is very fun to watch. Jackie plays Jackie, and he plays this character very well. The ladder battle is one of the best fights I have seen in a long while. Obviously, you dont have to see the Police Story movies in order, because they released them all out of order, going something like 3, 4, 1, 2. I recommend seeing them 4, 1, 3, 2. This one is the best and you should check it out right away!",
         "Jackie Chan plays a cop who chases a criminal from Russia to Australia.I don't bother telling more about the plot because it's really not important in this kind of movie.This is like a James Bond movie.But there's Chan, Jackie Chan in this one.The fighting sequences are unbelievable in this movie and there is a lot of action in it.Jackie hangs from a helicopter, skis with one ski, uses ladder for fighting and then there's under water action in the movie.It is also very funny.Jing cha gu shi IV: Jian dan ren wu which is also known as Jackie Chan's First Strike from 1996 was Jackie's first movie for American people to see.Jackie Chan is unbelievable in his moves.He is like new Bruce Lee but with his own style of course.He does his own stunts like Buster Keaton did.It is nice to watch the bloopers during credits.If you like martial arts or Jackie Chan this is a movie for you to enjoy.",
         "\"First Strike\" is at its worst when it tries to be a James Bond spoof and comes off as a cut-rate Bond imitation. It's at its best when it lets Jackie Chan do what he does best: performing awesome physical stunts and engaging in lightning-paced fight scenes. The plot is utterly disjointed, and I would go so far as to say that there are only two or three really good scenes here, but these are SO good they make the movie worth watching anyway. The \"ladder scene\", in particular, simply defies belief; Jackie Chan seems to be pushing the boundaries of what we consider \"humanly possible\". (**1/2)",
         "The second 1990s Jackie Chan film made for a worldwide market. It seems the team has learned its lessons with Rumble in the Bronx, as First Strike is more on pace. Filmed in Hong Kong, Ukraine, Russia and Australia, spy intrigue is combined with kung-fu comedy as Chan gets involved in the illegal sale of weapons by the Russian Mafia (yes, another film with this premise). Thanks largely to the presence of Chan, the storyline is pulled off relatively successfully. The ski stunts are impressive and also humorous - but poor Jackie - he really is wearing a couple of layers' clothing! The Australian action sequences are well choreographed and have a sense of occasion. The action is better paced: it is not kung-fu for kung-fu's sake, although if you want realism in your stories, look elsewhere. As an individual Chan film, it works - but it does not deserve being part of the Police Story series, which it was in Hong Kong. The Chinese style is watered down in pursuit of the western markets - and the producers would have been better off creating a new character for Chan this time. Compared to the first and third instalments, it is lacking. This aside, it is entertaining and enjoyable, whether you see the original or dubbed version.",
         "Part 4 of the Police Story series sees Jackie Chan's agile Hong Kong police inspector Chan Ka Kui become embroiled in James Bond-style international espionage after he is given the seemingly simple task of following beautiful suspect Natasha to Ukraine. When Natasha is abducted at the airport, Chan sets off in hot pursuit only to discover that she is involved with international arms dealers and the sale of a nuclear warhead. First Strike was made in the mid 90s, a transitional period for Jackie Chan, who was priming himself for his big move to the US. In order to broaden the star's appeal with the Western market, this one has a much more international flavour than many of his earlier films, with the action skipping round the globe, from Hong Kong to Ukraine to Russia and, finally, to Australia. The film is also less focused on pure martial arts mayhem, with more in the way of straight forward Hollywood style stunt-filled action, but when the kung fu does happen it is extremely well handled, with Jackie displaying his usual athleticism, impeccable timing, and flair for physical comedy. The rather messy plot and occasionally slow pacing prevents First Strike from being a bona fide Chan classic, but there is still plenty of inventive stuff to make this one a whole lot of fun, best bits being a wonderful fight scene in which Chan uses a stepladder as a weapon, an exhilarating ski chase down a mountain, some underwater shenanigans with sharks, and a scrap with two Russian man-mountains that involves Chan making a vertiginous leap onto a narrow ledge of a high-rise building."
