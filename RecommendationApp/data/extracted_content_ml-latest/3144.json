         "Simply the best of the Doris Day comedies of the 60s. Rod Taylor is handsome and romantic, Paul Lynde and Dom DeLuise are riotously funny as spies gone goofy. Lynde is especially effective in \"in satin\". Doris Day is, well, on top of her game as the charming, virtuous, innocent and freckle-faced heroine--but lookout when she gets her revenge! The finale is hilarious and even more risqué than was usual for the sex farces of the sixties. Probably my favourite DD movie! I know the pairing with Rock Hudson is better known from the period, (Pillow Talk) but this one with Rod Taylor as her leading man has an extra edge of spoofy comedy that makes it stand out among the rest.",
         "I've always loved this film; it's one of Doris' best and has a great opening song and sequence. Doris plays a widow who works at NASA. Rod Taylor plays a physicist who falls in love with her, and tries to get her to fall in love with him. Arthur Godfrey plays Doris' father, who runs a glass-bottom boat in Catalina. Some of the idiots at NASA decide that Doris is a spy, and there's lots of chases and red herrings as Paul Lynde (a security guard), Dick Martin (Rod's business partner), and Edward Andrews (playing a General), all try to unmask her. Doris decides to beat them at their own game when she overhears a phone conversation, and outspy's everyone. Paul Lynde gets to dress in a blue satin formal, and Rod finds Dick Martin and Edward Andrews in bed together! The whole thing is a real hoot, and you'll love those late 60's fashions and hairdo's. It's all a lot of harmless fun, and look quick for Robert Vaughn during the party scene!",
         "This fast and wild James Bond spoof is not the usual Doris Day bedroom comedy of the 60s. It's different in that it has a bevy of talented comic actors in supporting roles, who all have their moments to shine. Paul Lynde in drag is sublime. He looks spectacular in a red bouffant wig and aquamarine satin gown, and is even more glamorous than Doris. They have a \"powder room\" scene that is hilarious slapstick. Alice Pearce recreates her Gladys Kravitz-type character from \"Bewitched\" and is wonderful as usual. It's her last movie role, unfortunately, as she died too young. A young Dom DeLuise has a funny scene that he does in pantomime. Dick Martin shows up with some good reaction takes, and the great character actor Edward Andrews is also in fine blustering form. The stars, Doris and Rod Taylor, are quite appealing, although looking a bit too mature for their fluffy romance.",
         "I was 17 when this film was released and having fallen in love with Doris Day when I was 11, I was first in the queue. It is a wonderful, wacky film of the mid sixties and Doris Day and Rod Taylor are perfectly matched. The story is a simple case of mistaken identity when Doris is mistaken for a spy at the space centre where she works and Rod Taylor is a scientist. The glass bottom boat of the title is run by her father and provides a seperate focus for the story. The title song and Que Sera Sera are beautifully performed and do not detract from the comedy element of the film. I am submitting this today as I have just seen the film again on TV and it has lost none of its charm.",
         "What a warm, wonderful actress Doris Day is, what a knockout, what a screen presence. And just think, at the age of 42 (ancient by Hollywood standards in 1966) she was playing a desirable woman lusted after by several men. Glass Bottom Boat is a very '60s comedy in look and subject matter - the space age and spies. Taylor has invented a gizmo and when there's a leak from his project team, suspicion falls on Day, who works for the company and calls someone named Vladimir several times a day. Vladimir, however, is her dog, and she's calling him so he'll run around while the phone is ringing and get some exercise. The film is loaded with space-age gadgets. Taylor's computerized, motorized kitchen is great, complete with a floor-cleaning robot - wonder if the inventors of today's robot vacuum saw this movie. He also pilots his boat via a remote - but as he points out during a scene where the boat runs amok with Day inside, that needs further work. There's lots of slapstick and comedy support from Dom Deluise, Dick Martin, and Paul Lynde. Lynde, by the way, looked great in drag, and has some great delivery in his scenes. Some of the scenes, especially those of Deluise, had an improv feel. The late Eric Fleming, Clint Eastwood's boss on \"Rawhide,\" plays a CIA man. This was his last film; he drowned shortly afterwards. Rod Taylor, who, by the way, is younger than Doris Day, is effective as Day's romantic interest. Of note, radio personality Arthur Godfrey plays Day's father. There's also an appearance by Robert Vaughan as an homage to his \"Man from UNCLE\" character. Frothy fun, and Doris Day is always a delight.",
         "Is this Doris Day's best movie? Probably not, but it is one of her funniest and I laughed more here than at any of her bedroom comedies from this era. Fashionably advertised as a spy comedy--it's really not (there's one spy late in the film)--it features our Doris as a kooky widow with a menagerie of pets who spends her nights at school (some of her classes are ballet and map-making!) and her days as an aerospace tour guide. On the weekends, she dons a mermaid's tail and swims beneath her father's vessel. Doris is very down-to-the-earth here, never too-cute. I loved the warmly feminine feel she gives to the song \"Soft As The Starlight\", and the lovely look on her face after Rod Taylor kisses her for the first time. The slapstick stuff is very raucous and noisy, but I laughed out loud when Paul Lynde followed Doris into the ladies room dressed in drag, or when Doris makes a date with two different men for a romantic evening, and the men are the ones who end up (innocently) in bed together. Dick Martin says to Edward Andrews, \"Do you wanna meet early and pick out the furniture?\" An exceptionally smart bauble: breezy, plushly-made and essentially brainless, but it makes for a great couple of hours. ***1/2 from ****",
         "Director Frank Tashlin tries to do for Doris Day what he did for Lucille Ball (Miss Grant Takes Richmond), Bob Hope (Son of Paleface), and Jerry Lewis (Who's Minding the Store, many others) casting her in a comedy full of cartoonish color, gadgets, and slapstick. Not surprisingly Tashlin started as a director of Warner Brothers cartoons, moved into live action as a gag writer and became one of the most stylish directors of comedies. In many of his films Tashlin's world is full of out-of-control vacuum cleaners, remote control appliances, and a struggle to cope with the fast pace of modern civilization. In The Glass Bottom Boat (the title is misleading, the Catalina Island attraction is around just for the opening number) Tashlin pokes fun at the spy genre (most notably The Man From U.N.C.L.E. which was a popular TV show at the time). Rod Taylor is Day's romantic interest and the intellectual and corporate head of an aerospace corporation. He lives in a dream house with resort-style guest rooms, a futuristic kitchen, and a foyer that seems to go on forever. Doris Day plays an employee at his company who is mistaken for a spy by everyone but Taylor. Actually she is a widow who lives with her dog (he has a Russian name which adds to the confusion of her being a spy), some fish, and mockingbirds. The mockingbirds are tied into the title song which is sung to the tune of \"Mockingbird.\" (At least one professional critic missed the purpose of the Mockingbird song that's why I'm bringing it up.) Taylor and Day have pretty good chemistry but the story is more about the chase so we don't see much romance. Instead Tashlin prefers to tie the story together with slapstick scenes such as Hi-Fi installer Dom DeLuise and Day getting their feet stuck in a trash can, Day being chased by a robotic floor sweeper, and Day in a runaway (remote control) speed boat. These are signature pieces for Tashlin and he does a good job with them but Doris Day seems a bit out of place. Slapstick requires the actor to fill in the time with quick broad expressions and physicality. We think of a physical actress like Lucille Ball trapped in a glass shower filled with water and drawing laughs from her expressions and cries. In a similar scene with an automatic floor sweeper Doris Day just seems to be there letting the antics on stage play itself out. In another scene she's virtually hanging on in an out-of-control speed boat. We can imagine Jerry Lewis changing expressions every half second and flipping on his back every two. Tashlin's skill makes the scenes funny, but they are not as hilarious as when cast with a physical clown. Day does a lot better in the quieter romantic comedy scenes and is given incredible support by a never-ending list of character actors who steal each and every one of their scenes. Among the best are Paul Lynde as a security chief who dons poor disguises and Dick Martin as Rod Taylor's \"good-time\" partner. Paul Lynde is joined by fellow Bewitched alumni George Tobias and Alice Pearce, virtually replaying the neighbors of that TV show Mr. and Mrs. Kravitz, this time as Doris Day's neighbors, and watch for Robert Vaughn in a quick cameo as The Man From U.N.C.L.E. himself. Add to this a rare supporting role by Arthur Godrey (with his trademark ukulele) as Doris Day's dad (they sing a duet), 60's comedy \"stuffy character\" actors Edward Andrews and John McGiver, and a pre-Walton's Ellen Corby as Rod Taylor's maid. Most films from this era can look really outdated but the sets here still look retro-cool. For breezy 60's fun the film is worth a look and despite a slow start seems to get better and better all the way to the end as the supporting characters come together and start interacting with each other, not just with Day. If only the entire film had the energy of the finale there might have been some much needed belly laughs generated.",
         "This film has its moments of great screwball comedy, and Tashlin seems to keep alive the finesse and sophistication of a Hawks, McCarey or LaCava. The story built around the attraction between two opposite individuals never reach the sublime heights of `Bringing up Baby' \u0096needles to say, Taylor and Day aren't Grant and Hepburn-, and it seems that this film greatest problem is not to dare going too far in its craze, as other Tashlin's films like `Rock Hunter' or `Artists and Models' did. Probably the cause is the plot dealing with the cold war, a subject pretty much on the focus at the time. Now and them you feel that the director is doing a sort of journalism through a territory that doesn't suit him as good as Hollywood and its superficiality, for example. But Tashlin always manages to insert his comments about the decadence of American life, a circumstance that not even the fanciest of technology can hide. In his anarchic fashion, Tashlin's films counterpart Douglas Sirk's melodramas. Both are about the same, but the path chosen to express its vision are opposite. This film has a wonderful use of color, an admirable pacing and a freshness rarely seen in the studio comedies of the time (the singing scene in the boat looks totally improvised). But if Tashlin's background as a cartoonist often contributes to his creative ability to take situations beyond the edge, and to destroy a stiff established order, very seldom this very quality can work against him. And this is what happens with all the bad guys in this film. They are a mere caricature, and one can never feel them as a serious threat. The theme demanded something more serious, and these clumsy amateurs certainly fail. Anyway, watch the film and sing the title's tune; it'll remain with you for ages.",
         "This movie has to be one of my all time favorite Doris Day movies. This movie I think showed her serious side and her funny side. Dom Deluise is at his most funniest. He made a really terrible spy. Rod Taylor,Dick Martin and Paul Lynn really worked well together in the movie. Sometimes you get comedy movies with no real plot and terrible acting. Even though this plot was a little far fetched. It worked okay. The acting was good. The producer's also took advantage of Doris Day and had her use her most wonderful voice to sing some songs in the movie. To me that was okay. I had to buy another copy of this movie, I wore out my first one. This is a must have for good old fashioned comedy!",
         "A star-studded cast with the purist of early 60s silly humor. I first saw this movie on an airplane at age 6. It made me laugh then and it still makes me laugh to this day. Dom DeLouise and Paul Lynde are hysterically funny. Doris Day is as Doris as ever and Rod Taylor made a very dashing scientist! I love watching this movie for all the old styles and realizing that they are all back again. The jokes, though simple and harmless, are still humorous today and they were in 1966. Amazing how silly I though it was to have vacuum that did the cleaning without the assistance of a human. Amazing how they have those now ... a bit smaller that the movie version and I doubt that they would vacuum up a flip flop, but amazing that even a musical romantic comedy of the 60s would foretell us inventions to come. Dig those computers in this flick! And Dom DeLouise has been known (and seen) to eat many a gourmet item, but a transistor hors d'oeuvres? Silly, but sooooo funny. Take a trip to the blue room or red room and enjoy this fun film. But be careful, Doris Day just might be spying on you!"

She later discovers that Bruce is the big boss at her work (a research lab). Bruce hires Jennifer to be his biographer - only to try and win her affections. However, there's a problem. Bruce's friend General Wallace Bleeker believes that Jennifer is a Russian spy, and he has her placed under surveillance. Then, when Jennifer catches on...Watch Out!",
         "While not acting as a swimming mermaid for her father's Catalina based glass bottom tour boat business, widowed Jenny Nelson works in the public relations department of NASA, primarily acting as a tour guide. Feeling like no man can fill the void left by her husband's death, she spends her personal time taking care of her menagerie of pets or taking night classes. Regardless, Bruce Templeton, a research scientist on contract to NASA, does enter her life in a romantic sense despite their auspicious and antagonistic initial meeting. Bruce does whatever he can to infiltrate Jenny's life, even making up a non-existent and so-called top secret work project so that they can spend their working days together. Jenny believes that she is falling in love with him. Bruce's true work for NASA is on a gravity project called GISMO, the secret equation on which enemy regimes would love to get their hands. Based on circumstances, the CIA and NASA officials begin to suspect that Jenny is a spy working for the Soviets, something which Bruce does not truly believe, although he does have nagging suspicions as to Jenny's Soviet allegiances. The true spies working for the Soviets also begin to believe that Jenny is a spy working for another enemy regime. Jenny and Bruce's relationship is threatened by these suspicions, and would be further threatened if Jenny was ever to learn of the deceptions Bruce used to enter her life.",
