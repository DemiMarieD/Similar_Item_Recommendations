         "Go West is a movie that you seldom hear about and even Keaton did not consider it among his best. However, every time I see it, I cannot help but think that it is one of his funniest and most touching films. In his independent work, Keaton had an amazing ability to portray very unfortunate characters and yet not seem to be pandering to the audience for its pity. In this film, Keaton plays a character referred to as Friendless. The opening scenes of the film show him bouncing around from one unfortunate (and hilarious) situation to another. Yet rather than feel pity for him, the audience can root for this character and good-naturedly laugh at how Friendless reacts to and deals with his misfortunes. It's difficult not to admire the way he overcomes all challenges. When he finds a friend in a cow named Brown Eyes, his loyalty to her and the rancher that employed him precipitates an amazing sequence of events, culminating in an unbelievable cattle stampede through the streets of LA. Although, the scene may drag on a bit, I'll never forget the image of Buster Keaton running down a city street in a red devil's outfit being pursued by a giant herd of cattle. It is one of the most hilariously absurd scenes ever committed to film. There are great gags from beginning to end and, as usual for Keaton, the final sequence is very satisfying. In addition, the Kino release has an outstanding soundtrack which enhances the film considerably. I would highly recommend Go West to anyone as an introduction to Keaton, silent films, or comedies in general.",
         "There is a fundamental disagreement about Go West, between those who see it as Keaton's only sentimental movie, and those who think Buster is satirizing sentimentality. I'm in the latter group. Keaton's satire is so subtle, and so devoid of meanness, that people easily miss it\u0097but I'm convinced he's playing the whole opening sequence with tongue firmly in cheek. His character, \"Friendless,\" is just a shade too pathetic to take seriously; even a dog turns away coldly when he tries to pat it. Buster is not appealing for pity here, he's getting in a gentle dig at other performers (particularly, perhaps, one whose initials were C.C.) who did. In a later scene, mooning over a girl who won't give him the time of day, Buster leans wistfully against the edge of a well. His elbow knocks the bucket into the well, the rope unspools and the handle, spinning, clunks him smartly on the head. Don't feel sorry for me, he is saying: laugh at me. Buster's screen character is a stoic (as he was off-screen), and his sense of humor is part of his stoicism. His insistence on seeing the comedy even in painful and humiliating situations is the inexhaustible source of his dignity. Buster had a natural rapport with animals. He shares their mute patience: \"They do not sweat and whine about their condition,\" as Walt Whitman wrote, and neither did he. The heart of Go West is the touching\u0097though faintly ridiculous\u0097friendship between Friendless and Brown Eyes, a pretty little Holstein cow who is ostracized by other cows on the ranch where Friendless works as a hand. Buster trained Brown Eyes himself, and she follows him around with endearing, dopey devotion. In one of the film's best sight gags, he ties a pair of antlers on her head so that she can defend herself against horned steer. She looks like a seriously overweight reindeer. The plot is driven by Friendless's efforts to save Brown Eyes from being sent to the slaughterhouse with the rest of the cattle, and to save his employer from financial ruin. He shows some interest in his employer's attractive daughter, but not a whole lot; poor Kathleen Myers is left with little to do, and looks a bit miffed at playing second fiddle to a cow. Go West is easily Keaton's oddest film, and it's not entirely successful. There's a limit to how much comedy you can get out of cows. Where Buster got the idea of making a movie that centers around cattle I don't know (though I do think \"Brown Eyes\" is a joke about the devoted, cow-eyed leading ladies featured by some other comedians.) But once he got an idea, Buster always explored it thoroughly and carried it as far as it would go. He dreamed up a promising finale: a herd of cattle turned loose in the streets of Los Angeles. Unfortunately, as he himself later said, it didn't work out as planned. There's an enjoyable zaniness and surrealism to the spectacle, but it's all a little overplayed, Mack Sennett style, which is uncharacteristic for a Keaton movie. Even more atypically, he fakes the final stampede by speeding up the film: it just wasn't possible to get the cows moving fast enough to provide a satisfying final chase. The earlier part of Go West, however, contains a number of beautifully Keatonesque moments: his attempt to adopt a bowlegged walk to look like an old cowboy, the elegantly summarized sequence where he rides the rails, the perfect timing of the supper table scenes, in which Buster repeatedly arrives just as everyone is leaving, then finally \"turns the tables.\" Just hired at the ranch, Buster is handed a pail and stool and told to milk a cow. He approaches the cow, places the pail under her udders, sits down a discreet yard away and waits for the cow to do her thing. When nothing happens, he takes the pail and shows it to the cow, in case she didn't notice it was there, puts it back and keeps waiting patiently. Playing it straight, never italicizing his jokes, finding comedy in stillness and in not reacting, a comedy of negative spaces, is the essence of Keaton's style. He never \"milks\" his gags\u0097not even this one. In my favorite scene, Buster pokes fun at his own \"stone face\" persona. He's playing cards with a couple of tough cowboys and accuses one of cheating. The cowboy pulls out his six-gun, levels it at Buster, and orders, \"When you say that\u0097SMILE.\" Buster's reaction is one of his subtlest and most ineffably hilarious close-ups. He pauses; he ponders\u0097not whether to smile, but how to get out of the jam since he CAN'T smile. He tries out the Lillian Gish, Broken Blossoms bit of pushing the corners of his mouth up with his fingers. Not good enough. He sighs. Then a crafty determination creeps into his eyes. He insinuates his pinky behind the cowboy's trigger finger, and with all his strength keeps him from squeezing the trigger while he pulls out his own tiny gun (which, for convenience, he has attached to a string like a child's mitten) and makes the guy back down. Not smiling is a matter of life and death.",
         "\"Go West\" is an enjoyable change-of-pace from Keaton. It has a creative story that enables Buster to demonstrate some different acting skills, while still having plenty of his trademark slapstick, chases, and stunts, especially in the last half of the film. It's not one of his best-remembered films today, largely because it is rather old-fashioned and sometimes slow, but it has a great many merits for those who enjoy silent comedies. Buster's character is down on his luck, and decides to head west. He winds up on a ranch, working as a cowhand. As he tries rather ineffectively to learn the trade, he becomes attached to a particular cow, 'Brown Eyes'. While trying to protect Brown Eyes from harm, he is caught in the middle of the desperate attempts of the rancher and the rancher's daughter to save their business. Keaton is very good in evoking sympathy for his character while still being amusing, and the story is touching at times while remaining pleasantly silly at others. There are times when it does move pretty slowly, but it is always pleasant to watch. The film would be well worth seeing for the last portion alone. Everything comes together in a madcap stampede sequence that is extremely funny and that contains a lot of inventive gags. It's classic Keaton, and a great way to top off a rather different story. If you are a fan of Buster or of silent comedy in general, make sure to give this one a try. It's not the kind of film that could be expected to attract a wide audience today, but it's a pleasant and enjoyable film, and you might like it as much as those of us on this page have enjoyed it.",
         "No, as most critics have said, this isn't one of Buster Keaton's better feature films, but it's not bad and surely it is better than what you might have read in some critic's book. It has its moments and is a bit different in way, if you consider a man and cow falling in love with each other! (This should be a \"cult classic!\") Buster heeds the advice, \"Go West, Young Man, Go West,\" and winds up out in the middle of nowhere after crawling inside a barrel and then the barrel falling out of a train. He winds up taking discarded cowboy clothes and trying his hand at that profession but, of course, has no clue even how to ride a horse. His only accomplishment is taking a stone out of a cow's hoof. The cow is so grateful, it follows Buster around the rest of the movie and the two become quite attached. After some low-key attempts at several projects, Buster winds up - I am really condensing this - back on a train with the cattle hoping to be sold so that the almost-destitute boss can get enough money to save his ranch. The train is robbed, the cattle derailed and the herd winds up in the middle of a big city! That's the real fun part of the film, as it is in so many silent comedies. The adventures of seeing a herd of cattle going down the main city streets and then into barbershops, Turkish baths, Ladies Department Stores, etc., is very funny. The ending was very clever and final punch-line not what the viewers anticipate. All in all, not a lot of laugh-out-loud scenes but a decent Keaton silent film and definitely worth a watch. I am glad most of the reviewers here appreciated this movie.",
         "I have to say I really like this movie because my recently deceased Grandfather had this movie on VHS tape and when I watched it I was able to get a huge amount of laughs out of it because of what Buster Keaton did when he dressed up in the DEVIL costume to get those cows to chase him to the Livestock yard. That was one good movie that should be available for everyone to watch. I just love how it shows that chase down the streets of that one city when those cows are all stampeding after the man in the costume because of how cows chase red things. I just wish that TV stations like AMC and Turner Classic Movies would show this film over and over again because this is a whole lot better than the films that are released today.",
         "Go West is a movie that you seldom hear about and even Keaton did not consider it among his best. However, every time I see it, I cannot help but think that it is one of his funniest and most touching films. In his independent work, Keaton had an amazing ability to portray very unfortunate characters and yet not seem to be pandering to the audience for its pity. In this film, Keaton plays a character referred to as Friendless. The opening scenes of the film show him bouncing around from one unfortunate (and hilarious) situation to another. Yet rather than feel pity for him, the audience can root for this character and good-naturedly laugh at how Friendless reacts to and deals with his misfortunes. It's difficult not to admire the way he overcomes all challenges. When he finds a friend in a cow named Brown Eyes, his loyalty to her and the rancher that employed him precipitates an amazing sequence of events, culminating in an unbelievable cattle stampede through the streets of LA. Although, the scene may drag on a bit, I'll never forget the image of Buster Keaton running down a city street in a red devil's outfit being pursued by a giant herd of cattle. It is one of the most hilariously absurd scenes ever committed to film. There are great gags from beginning to end and, as usual for Keaton, the final sequence is very satisfying. In addition, the Kino release has an outstanding soundtrack which enhances the film considerably. I would highly recommend Go West to anyone as an introduction to Keaton, silent films, or comedies in general.",
         "A young man named Friendless decides to head east when his luck runs out. After nearly getting trampled by an average New York pedestrian crowd, Friendless takes Horace Greeley's advice and heads west via rail. Friendless accidently is sent off the train, he ends up at an Arizona ranch, where the owner gives him a job as a hand. Soon there he meets his first friend, a cow named Brown Eyes. When Brown Eyes is to be taken with the rest of the herd for the slaughterhouse, Friendless goes with Brown Eyes to prevent her turning into a steak dinner, until a rival ranch holds up the train, and Friendless ends up driving the entire herd through the busy 1920's streets of Los Angeles to market. This Keaton film differs from the other's he made in the 1920's, where it is more of a drama, and sacrificing the Keaton routine of the young man who unwillingly is called to do the extraordinary things, in a sense a Chaplin film. There are a few good sight gags though (Buster waiting for a cow to give milk, his failures to get to the dinner table on time), but the scenes with Brown Eyes are the movie. Rating- 7.",
         "After trading all his belongings for a large sandwich, Keaton's nameless character hops on a train with the intent of leaving his small town for the big city. He quickly realizes that city life is no better for him as he's literally trampled underfoot by a crowd of people and jumps on the train again, this time with the intention of seeking his fortune as so many did in the west. He falls out near a large cattle ranch and manages to secure work there. Of course he's quite unsuited for the ranch lifestyle as well. He befriends a cow that's nearly as unwanted as he is and spends most of his time on the ranch protecting his bovine protégé. All is not well at the ranch, however, as the proprietor must sell his herd right away or risk losing his business. Keaton's character accompanies the cows on their train ride and ends up attempting to drive the whole lot of them to the slaughterhouse all by himself. This is fraught with complication and the cattle run riot through the streets (and buildings!) of Los Angeles in an exciting set piece that includes Keaton dressing up in a red devil costume complete with horns and a tail. The film is interesting in that it focuses on an area of Western life that gets less attention: the day to day lifestyle of ranchers and their hands. The first half of the film is full of humorous scenes that set up the character and the situation and the later half of the film has the most laughs as Keaton navigates his way through a series of wild cow in the city scenarios. The story is a bit on the slight side but the comedy works as well as always. This film is proof that even a minor work from a legend like Keaton is still near great.",
         "Though it's not a masterwork like \"The General\", \"Go West\" perhaps has more heart than any other Keaton film. \"Friendless\" Buster, after being literally downtrodden in the big city, heads West, where he finds friendship in the most unlikely of leading ladies -- an equally forsaken little cow named Brown Eyes. Keaton manages to make this implausible relationship believable, which it has to be, since the logic of the film hinges on it. Pulling off this cinematic magic displays a new and surprising side of Keaton's virtuosity as an actor and director. I'd not recommend \"Go West\" as a starter film for those not already familiar with Buster Keaton, but it's a delightful, poignant and funny piece of work.",
         "Though 'Go West (1925)' does not contain much of the technical wizardry and daredevil stunt-work that makes Busters Keaton's films so amazingly entertaining, it does contain a massive amount of heart, and that's just a different reason to watch it. Written and directed by Keaton himself (with writing assistance from Lex Neal and a scenario by Raymond Cannon), the film focuses on the cowboy exploits of a young, friendless man who finds the hustle-and-bustle of the city too much for him, and so ships out west in search of a new life. Though Keaton knowingly sets up the film to be a story of budding romance between himself and a beautiful girl (Kathleen Myers), it is here that tale takes a unique turn. While on the cattle ranch, Keaton falls in love with an adorable young cow named Brown Eyes, who affectionately follows him around wherever he goes. While human friendships have offered him little, in Brown Eyes Keaton finds a companion for life, and he tries everything in his attempts to stop the cow from being slaughtered. The final twenty minutes of the film contains one of Keaton's most ambitious set-pieces {and this certainly says a lot}, as he releases 1000 cattle to stampede through the streets of Los Angeles. Though some of the gags do go a bit over-the-top, there is an incredible energy in the sequence in which Keaton \u0096 dressed in a red devil suit to attract the cows' attention \u0096 sprints feverishly down the busy road, hundreds of bovine in tow, and an entire squad of panicked policemen clutching at his costume's dragging tail. The film's final joke is a classic one: the thankful ranch owner (Howard Truesdale) offers Keaton absolutely anything he wants in return for delivering the cattle and averting financial ruin. Keaton meekly declares \"I want her,\" and casts his finger backwards in the direction of the man's pretty daughter. We are momentarily shocked at our hero's unexpected arrogance, but then Keaton plods off behind a wall and returns with Brown Eyes on a leash, and we understand that it had all been an amusing misunderstanding. Thus ends the most unusual love story of the silent era."
