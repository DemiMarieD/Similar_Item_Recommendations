      "overview": "This true story follows the exploits of a top secret British military mission to destroy Nazi radio ships in a neutral harbor during WWII. The daring plan is led by British Intelligence officers Col. Lewis Pugh (Gregory Peck) and Capt. Gavin Stewart (Roger Moore). Since the ships are in neutral territory the British Military command, while encouraging the scheme, must deny any knowledge of it if it fails. Pugh and Stewart enlist the aid of retired officer Col. Bill Grice (David Niven) and some of his former soldiers. On the pretext of being on a fishing expedition, these seemingly drunken old men in civilian clothing must board and destroy 3 Nazi ships, whose radio transmissions have resulted in Nazi submarines sinking allied ships. While Stewart arranges a diversion on shore, Pugh and Grice carry out the dangerous raid on and destruction of the Nazi ships.",

         "Yes, Peck had a hard time with holding a British accent, Costner's Robin Hood didn't even try. Yes, there were a bunch of older actors in it, it's about older characters. No, it doesn't have an explosion a minute or a bunch of hard bodied guys or gorgeous babes, that's not what this movie is about and it doesn't need them. It's about a bunch of geezer who, despite being a bit over the hill, still have some sense of adventure and a bit of fight left in them. When viewed from that perspective this movie does the job very well. It doesn't need the repeated and obviously fake explosions and computer generated torn body parts that seems to be the requisite for contemporary adventure films. It's a relatively subdued spinning of a yarn based (loosely, I suppose) on a true story. It's heartwarming to watch the bunch of old soldiers (admitedly, not too much older than myself) pull it together one more time. On one of those cold, bleak winter afternoons when you're feeling that you might have missed out on a few of life's adventures, watch this movie and let yourself think, maybe, just maybe there's still a chance to live them.",
         "A ponderous, but stately homage to the British Empire and the actual superlative function of British Intelligence. It is beautifully photographed, and in no hurry, which is somewhat refreshing in the light of modern, hyperactive drama. The film features solid acting by some great names supported by a prime polo stable of British character actors. The film makes a conscious effort to keep close to the historical record, which would be the reason for some of its more unlikely episodes. Only the writers of fiction need restrict themselves to the probable. David Niven is worthy of himself, as is Gregory Peck, with an underplayed British accent. Roger Moore has a great deal of fun being a spy who is NOT James Bond, and is clearly enjoying the role. His feminine antagonist is portrayed as lethal and skilled, and Trevor Howard does himself credit in advanced old age. The film's accurate sets and equipment are the results of many of the actual parties involved assisting in the film, which was made two years after the actual records of the Raid on Goa were finally made public by the British government.",
         "The film opens with incredibly accurate information that Forty-six freighters were sunk by the German submarines in the Indian Ocean in the past few weeks\u0085 The U-boats know exactly where and when to strike\u0085 On one hand, we also know that the Portuguese authorities dismantled the ships' radios when they gave them permission to stay there\u0085 On the other, if Radio Monitoring is right, and the transmitter is actually in the harbor, it must be on a ship\u0085 Not being able to break the code, the British Intelligence has to find out from where the information to those U-boats originates\u0085 To find whoever heads the spy ring, and to get rid of the transmitter without forgetting to violate Portugal's neutrality\u0085 Now if a British Commando cannot violate Goa's neutral status, they might have to turn to amateurs\u0085 The Light Horse has not been in action as a unit since the Boer War in 1900\u0085 If they were caught, it might be taken as a drunken escapade\u0085 We are speaking about ex-soldiers on holiday, stealing a river ferry, sailing it the whole way round India from Calcutta to Cochin\u0085 and then heading for the neutral port of Mormugoa, Portuguese colony... In that port, at anchor is a German ship, the Ehrenfels\u0085 Their job is to seize that ship, or sink her where she is\u0085 Also in that port are two other German ships so if they can knock them off at the same time, so much the better\u0085 As you can see it is a crucial operation where many allied lives might be saved\u0085 David Niven is the only man with any experience at sea\u0085Charlie Wilton will remain aboard to nurse the engine of the old tub\u0085 Trevor Howard will have his only chance to settle accounts for his boy killed in Burma\u0085 Roger Moore has to deal with some spies\u0085 Peck has to lead the whole suicide adventure\u0085 The film moves along beautifully, reaching an exciting and tense climax\u0085 Don't miss it!",
         "What a group of strange reviews. Granted, I am 69 but I just started watching tons of movies since retiring (we had no money growing up). Thank God for cable, especially TCM, AMC and the History Channel. (And to IMDb.com - the first favourite added to my desktop in 1994!) The fact that this is based on a true story made all the difference. Yes, life was like that back then. Re: Mr. Peck's accent - I've known plenty of Englishmen who sounded like that. What odd comments. The locations were great - nice to see something authentic. And I agree, the clothing could have been a bit less modern. Finances were tight all over during WWII. And to say these actors were past their prime! An actor is an actor is an actor - until physically or mentally impaired. (I've felt this way since high school so it is not just compassion for those now in my age group.) All in all, a satisfying experience.",
         "They just turn up in films like this. I loved this film. The combination of these great old stars and charecter actors having a lark in a war film. Fantastic. The trick with this film is not to take it too seriously. Just sit back and release your grip on reality for a couple of hours. Pity we don't get more films like this today.",
         "The Sea Wolves is based on a true incident in which a bunch of middle aged and more than middle aged old soldiers from the British Raj in India got together and blew up three German freighters interned in the Port of Goa on the western coast of India. The British had a delicate diplomatic problem. For over 300 years Goa and some surrounding suburb was Portugese territory and Portugal under Salazar was neutral in World War II. Made it a place for a whole lot of intrigue. The Nazis had a transmitter on one of those ships that was relaying information about allied shipping and the U-boats were cleaning up. You might ask why it was the Nazis and not the Japanese. Very simply the Japanese never developed any real submarine capability just as the Nazis disdained developing aircraft carriers. Had both done so, World War II might have turned out differently, at least that's a pet theory of mine. Gregory Peck and Roger Moore get the job of doing something about the spying and the transmitter. Roger Moore goes into Goa and does a little counterespionage. He certainly as James Bond has the right credentials. He even has a fling with the head Nazi who is a woman played by the very beautiful Barbara Kellerman. Peck trains a force of former members of the Indian army now retired and waiting for the Raj to end as everyone but Winston Churchill knew it would. David Niven, Trevor Howard, Allan Cuthbertson, Patrick MacNee are some of men employed to go into Goa harbor and do away with those ships. These are patriotic men whose country is in her biggest crisis and feel helpless in not being able to be of service. It's that way when you've spent your life in the military. When the opportunity knocks, they kick down the door. In a recent biography of David Niven it's mentioned that Niven enjoyed being reunited with his Guns of Navarone co-star Gregory Peck and another guy who he had worked with, Trevor Howard. But the film was done in actual location in India and it was sometimes 140 degrees fahrenheit. It was pretty stressful and it exacerbated the symptoms of an undetected Lou Gehrig's disease that eventually took David Niven from us. I remember in the early sixties Goa was eventually just taken over by India. The Portugese had a lease there just as they did at Macao and the British did in Hong Kong. But the Indians just weren't that patient. The Sea Wolves is a good and entertaining film about a little known and very minor operation during World War II.",
         "THE SEA WOLVES is a fabulous adventure, based upon the true story of The Calcutta Light Horse, retired British veterans of the Boer War who are called upon to perform a secret mission in India during World War II. (The main historical source is the book, \"Boarding Party,\" by James Leasor.) A witty, well-structured script by Reginald Rose and solid direction by Andrew V. McLaglen make this a good old-fashioned filmgoing experience. (Both were also responsible, along with producer Euan Lloyd, for the excellent THE WILD GEESE.) The film moves along well, graced by a distinguished cast: Gregory Peck, Roger Moore, Trevor Howard, Patrick Macnee and, in his last major role, the ever-suave David Niven. You'll cheer for the gallery of British supporting players who, fighting age and seasickness, struggle to get in shape for this \"last charge\" -- patriots whose desire to serve one more time pulls them away from their comfortable world of polo, cricket, and drinks at the club. They face a worthy adversary in Barbara Kellermann. Perhaps one may quibble with the uneven quality of Peck's British accent, but his customarily dignified presence makes up for it. Moore is rather Bondish here -- the womanizer of the group -- but ironically, more impressive than in his 007 films. (True Bondophiles will notice several 007 veterans among the crew, including editor John Glen, title artist Maurice Binder, and Matt Monro, who sings the closing theme.) McLaglen makes excellent use of the Indian locations, mainly Goa and Delhi, as he builds his story to an exciting climax. (The perpetrators of OCTOPUSSY should have taken lessons from this film.) The result is a truly classy adventure, without the high-tech noise and hot air of so many films. NOTE: The Sea Wolves should have shot those responsible for the dim-witted advertising campaign, reproduced on both the VHS and DVD boxes! It is a MAD Magazine-type caricature which would lead anyone to believe that the film is a slapstick comedy.",
         "Based on a true story, the Sea Wolves are a geriatric impossible mission team called back to duty after 40 years of retirement with the offer of a dangerous mission that carries no hope of reward or recognition for their efforts. And they jump at the chance! The movie itself is rather average, but the story is great fun, and more suspensible at times than one might expect. It suffers only from a decidedly 1970s made-for-television feel to the production, though the story is set in 1943. But even this drawback is ameliorated somewhat by closing credits where images of the real-life heroes from World War II are juxtaposed with those of the actors who immortalized their heroism in this film. Well worth watching.",
         "In March 1943, in the World War II, the Germans use the neutral harbor of the Portuguese colony of Mormugoa to transmit information to a U-Boat about the allied ships to sink them in international waters. In Calcutta, the British Intelligence assigns Colonel Lewis Pugh (Gregory Peck) and Captain Gavin Stewart (Roger Moore) to spy in Goa and they discover that there are three German vessels anchored in the area and the famous spy Trompeta (Wolf Kahler) is based in Goa. They kidnap Trompeta to interrogate him but Lewis accidentally kills the spy after fighting with him in the runaway car. Meanwhile Gavin has one night stand with the gorgeous and elegant Mrs. Cromwell (Barbara Kellerman), who is the partner of Trompeta. They fail in their mission, but Lewis and Gavin convince their chief to use the veterans from Calcutta Light Horse led by the retired Colonel W.H. Grice (David Niven) to travel to Goa on board of the old ship Phoebe, pretending to be drunken businessmen on holiday. They prepare to destroy the Ehrenfels and the two other Nazi radio ships and get the German secret codes under the command of Lewis. Meanwhile Gavin on shore has a love affair Mrs. Cromwell and prepares the diversion to facilitate the mission of Lewis and his men. \"The Sea Wolves\" is an entertaining adventure apparently based on a true but incredible story. The use of retired military in the operation in a neutral zone seems to be too fantastic and romantic to be true and does not make sense why risky the operation exposing old men and not real soldiers. Would it make any difference to England after the sinking of twelve allied vessels? The unknown Barbara Kellerman is really a pretty woman and tailored for the role of a seductive spy. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Espionagem em Goa\" (\"Spionage in Goa\")",
         "A neutral Portugese port in India has three German cargo ships in it. One of them is believed to contain a hidden short wave radio that is transmitting the locations of British war ships to U-Boats, costing the British Navy dearly in the Indian Ocean. Because the port is neutral, Allied forces are not allowed to enter and destroy the radio. A plan is finally devised to use aged retired members of the, no longer in use, Calcutta Light Horse, who are now enjoying the joys of civilian life. But, is there really a radio in the harbor? If so, which ship is it on? This is quite an entertaining film, especially for those who enjoy (and remember) Gregory Peck, David Niven, Trevor Howard, and many many more British actors."

      "plotSummary": "This true story follows the exploits of a top secret British military mission to destroy Nazi radio ships in a neutral harbor during WWII. The daring plan is led by British Intelligence officers Col. Lewis Pugh (Gregory Peck) and Capt. Gavin Stewart (Roger Moore). Since the ships are in neutral territory the British Military command, while encouraging the scheme, must deny any knowledge of it if it fails. Pugh and Stewart enlist the aid of retired officer Col. Bill Grice (David Niven) and some of his former soldiers. On the pretext of being on a fishing expedition, these seemingly drunken old men in civilian clothing must board and destroy 3 Nazi ships, whose radio transmissions have resulted in Nazi submarines sinking allied ships. While Stewart arranges a diversion on shore, Pugh and Grice carry out the dangerous raid on and destruction of the Nazi ships.",
