         "This movie is about a group of off-off Broadway actor wanna bes who moonlight as illegal money collectors. One of their crew (Barbara Hershey) wants to leave and start a new life with her young son. Unfortunately, her ex-husband (Robbie Coltrane) is the theatre impresario/loan shark who pulls the strings of everyone's ambitions. A very unusual vision of the gangster comedy theme. It takes the generalized neuroses and psychoses of actors (ego, ambition, narcissism, paranoia, etc) and runs the gamut from somewhat healthy to psychotic. People alternate from friends, lovers, and assassins at the turn of an audition announcement and will begin monologues from plays and movies with little to no warning (this will be fun for theatre/movie buffs). The plot, unlike some movies, actually requires attention and a large cast (most of whom are one to two sceners) delivers excellent performances all around. FYI: has some scenes of graphic violence. Worth a rent/buy used. Due to its singular style, I would suggest renting first, as it will not be everyone's cup of tea.",
         "I actually like this movie. I can see how some people might find it pretentious but those people are just not buying into the concept. It's kind of a campy send-up of Tarantino-ish films substituting a motley group of sleazy actors for just plain sleaze-balls. Instead of long monologues by inane lowlifes about pop culture (a la Pulp Fiction) you get more articulate and literary monologues culled from films, sometimes done with some style and finesse, other times done just for unintentional self-parody, by a colorful group of actors/gangsters. As with any parody, there are times when the characterizations seem over-the-top but mostly I found them clever and funny. To the film's credit, it doesn't take itself too seriously, simply drawing a parallel between the actor's process and the process of the gangster getting into character for the gruesome deeds they do. Barbara Hershey plays the lead character trying to `get out of the life' and out of acting. She is not the most charismatic actress but she does have her moments even if there are times it seems her character's disaffection for her world fails to hold our sympathies. Robbie Coltrane never quite seems convincing as the thick-accented Eastern European gang leader and aspiring impresario. However, Lisa Marie as Myrna is wonderful as the incredibly hot if not-so-talented actress and there are other fine performances from others in the film. The ending is schmaltzy but for the most part the film is quite entertaining.",
         "There is almost no reason for me to write. Many of you have done the job for me. But I take the misuse and co-option of a \"Downtown\" NY vibe in this movie as a personal affront. Amos Poe has some kind of Alt -street cred, although now I can't remember for what. Something to do with Debbie Harry. But he (on the basis of this film) is not an artist, not an entertainer, not a good post-modernist, not very smart! As many have pointed out, he knows how to quote from much better things. And he knows how to cast weirdly iconic actors and use interesting East Village locations. But the killing scenes are excessive, the acting scenes are unconvincing. And neither illuminates the other. Jim Jarmusch, forgive me! Any doubts I have had about your genius have been erased by this slop. I understand now (I already liked it a lot) what a massive achievement Ghost Dog is. You have quoted Godard, but added something to our understanding, as Godard did with such as Fuller and Ray. This guy, on the other hand belongs in the Press area of a European Blondie Reunion concert, holding a Poloroid camera. He totally wasted my time with his smarmy, hipper-than-thou bullshit. Lisa Marie is hot though.",
         "Some movies are like olives or wine; you need to have developed a taste before you can fully enjoy them. The story was unexpected and definitely better the second time around since I was paying attention this time. If you like dark humor you'll love Barbara Hershey and this great cast doing a wonderful job. It is well above par for this genre.",
         "Maybe it isn't THE worst but it sure comes close! The concept? A group of wanna-be actors moonlight as collection agents and thugs for a theatre impresario cum gangster. In between shooting people, including each other, they recite scenes from movies, everything from 'The Third Man' to 'Repo Man'. Does that sound stupid? You bet! Watching this until the end is a chore. Only masochists or people with a perverse fascination for truly awful movies will manage it. Writer/director Amos Poe probably argues that \"quoting\" from other (MUCH better!) movies is some kind of post-modernist statement about art and creativity. Really it's because he doesn't have enough talent to write his own original dialogue and characters. An unspeakably AWFUL movie that everyone involved with should be embarrassed about.",
         "I would not trust the review or ratings on this site. Over the years, I've found that if you like independent, quirky films that are not predictable and clich√©, you can disregard most of the ratings here because people that are active are no help. I only recently joined to give my two cents, only because I finally got sick of the awful reviews and strange ratings. This movie is hilarious, and offers a dark, comic backstage view of the NY theater, and the New York street that's without compare in films. The actors are top shelf, and they are not out there doing it on a hunch. You should rent it and make up your own mind rather than listen to anything written here, including me.",
         "Yes, it's on film, it is around 90 minutes like a feature, it's got something that resembles a plot that provides and excuse for the performances, and it seems to participate in a genre marked by \"Pulp Fiction.\" But take this for what it is, some very good actors jamming. Barbara Hershey's characterization is superb -- hers and the other performances had me mesmerized (like a frog by a snake?)-- it's that thing that actors do, that transformation that gives a shiver of the uncanny.",
         "and a really HUGE warm pile of crap. This stinker can be smelled from a country mile away. Dont go too close or might get some on you. Idiotic story and even worse acting..if thats possible. Run! and dont look back, or you may just turn into a pillar of salt.",
         "Poorly acted, lamely scripted, unnecessarily violent, and pretentious far beyond the typical indie films, \"Frogs and Snakes\" was one of the worst films of 1998. While a bad film may be enjoyable on some level for its cheesiness or other lame aspect, this film's self-importance and supposedly \"deep\" dialogue makes you want to gag. Nothing redeemable.",
         "Underground director Amos Poe presents this Tarantino-esque gangster movie, which is also a close portrait of a woman trying to break free from her old life. All trimmed with some violence, black humour and loads of quotations from the world of theater and movies. (watched @ the world premier at the Filmfestspiele Berlin)"
