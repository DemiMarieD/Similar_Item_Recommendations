         "I don't mind watching Leslie Neilsen as he is quite funny at times. This movie is really aimed at very young children who will find the slapstick gags extremely funny and not so lame as the rest of us think! The gags are pretty lame and repetetive, but, oddly enough, I liked the movie. It had a charm and a nice warmness that made me enjoy it!",
         "The movie \"Mr. Magoo\" is an adaptation of the popular cartoon. For what it's worth, it does a good job of presenting itself as a live-action cartoon. Leslie Nielsen has made a career of acting in screwball comedy. He seems to fit his role well as the famously weak-eyed character. In this day and age of political correctness, making a movie such as this was bound to raise a few hackles. The little disclaimer run by Disney about the blind should give you an idea what the PC movement has done to movies today. The point of the cartoon was not to put down the blind at all. So forget what others say, and look this \"Magoo\" over!",
         "Mr Magoo was a hilarious movie. I don't know why everyone gives it so much grief. First of all, Leslie Nielsen is one of the funniest actors alive, and I personally like movies in which the characters just happen to walk right into a worst case scenario. And after three Naked Gun movies, who's better qualified for that job than Leslie Nielsen. In this movie, Nielsen's character, Mr. Magoo, has to solve the case of a stolen ruby from his mueseum. Coming along with him are his dog, Angus and his nephew, Waldo. To those of you who saw the film and hated it, remember, the film is directed toward kids and Disney fans. It wasn't meant to be an \"A\" class movie. PS: Would you like it more if you knew that Jennifer Garner is in it?",
         "Ha! Ha! Ha! I laughed all the movie. Leslie Nielsen knows how to make \"stupid\" movies. It's not the comedy of the year but it's great for family and friends who want to take a break from BIG BANG movies. My Vote: 6/10",
         "i honestly don't understand the low rating this movie has on this site.I'll admit it's no masterpiece,but it is vastly entertaining.to me,Leslie Nielson is perfectly cast as Mr.Magoo.if you don't know the character of Mr.Magoo,he was originally a cartoon character who is absurdly near sighted,leading him into all kinds of trouble,yet he is generally oblivious to most of what's going on.oh yeah,he is also very wealthy.the live action movie portrays the character pretty much exactly the same.he always seems to come out of any potential trouble with virtually no signs of any problem.in the movie,Magoo,helps solve a crime and help put the baddies in jail,with a lot of help,from both his nephew and his dog.yes,i said dog.this dog is is very intelligent and saves Magoo from many mishaps,both minor and major.Kelly Lynch portrays one of the criminals and she does a very fine job in her role.not to mention she is hot,hot,hot.anyway,like i said earlier,the movie is certainly very amusing,and contains an absolutely hysterical sequence with Magoo in the kitchen.there's also some great action and some great martial arts moves,courtesy of Lynch's character.for the most part,this is a great family movie,with maybe a bit of mild language.for me,the live action version of Mr.Magoo is an 8.5/10,based simply on how entertaining it is.",
         "I remember when I went to this movie with my mom in Germany. I laugh so much watching it ... and like for 10 years I kept it in so good memories. Then came the day when Mr.Magoo was being showed on our TV station in Latvia, I wanted to see it so much ... I even taped it. But when I watched it I was so disappointed. I didn't even smile while watching it. Well what I wanted to say with this, you can't rate this kind of movies like a grownup. It's not a comedy made for us but for the kids, and watching this they won't be disappointed. And the parents won't be disappointed too because they will see their kids smiling and smile with them. Because of the grate memories 10/10.",
         "Mr. Magoo, a favorite cartoon character, is brought to life by the comical Leslie Nielsen. As a millionaire and art lover, Magoo opens the exhibit of a large, beautiful ruby at the local museum. Soon after, jewel thieves break into the museum and steal the gem. However, through a series of mishaps, it ends up in the tackle box of Mr. Magoo. The thieves are then, of course, after Mr. Magoo and go through many twists and turns to recover the ruby. Along the way, there are car chases, boat chases, and helicopter chases. There are even baboon chases. Will be stunning jewel end up with the good guys of the film (such as Mr. Magoo) or will it ultimately be taken by the thieves? This film is by no means a gem of a movie. Yet, it is watchable (especially the second half) and mildly humorous. Kelly Lynch seems to relish her role as a female thief. Mr. Magoo also keeps a little English bulldog whose appearances are always welcome. This viewer purchased the video for $1.00 at the secondhand store and feels she got her money's worth and more. Recommended as acceptable family entertainment for a break from the regular television schedule.",
         "Mr Magoo is as wealthy as he is short-sighted and it is this combination that sees him trapped in the museum he is patron of late one night, when a robbery occurs. The CCTV footage makes him look like he was in on it and the FBI/CIA investigation focuses on him as they try to locate a stolen diamond while keeping the robbery on the low-down. Meanwhile, as he fishes, Magoo manages to have the stolen jewel dropped into his fishing box (best not to ask how) and thus is unwittingly pursued by thieves and cops. OK. This is based on a old cartoon character so I tried to ignore the modern PC outrage over this film by disabled groups protesting the depiction of partial blindness. According to IMDb it was this that saw the film sliding into video obscurity however I beg to differ. I was outraged by this film \u0096 but not for the reasons of objecting to the fact that it gets laughs out of a disability, but rather the fact that it totally fails to get laughs out of a disability. I'd love to pretend to be politically correct and sensitive but there we go! No, the main problem I had with the film is that it is simply not funny. Obviously the gags are all pretty obvious and can be seen coming from miles off but it still surprised me by how lazy it all was. The plot makes no sense but this was perhaps to be expected, however the total delivery is poor. A constantly \"wacky\" score is forced upon us in a desperate attempt to make us believe that it is hilarious when it is not. Nielsen was a great choice for the lead but even he can do nothing with this rot and in failing to improve it he just becomes part of the problem. The support cast features turns from Garner, Hudson, Tobolowsky, Lynch, Ferrer and McDowell all of whom are either wasted, look embarrassed or both. As director Tong seems to worry that the jokes will surprise his audience and, I assume, fearing injury from split sides, makes sure that we all get a chance to see each and every gag coming from quite a distance. Overall then, a film that will appeal to few audience demographics outside of children and those currently drunk. The jokes are obvious and lazy and all that is left is a terrible plot that (perhaps correctly) assumes the audience has the IQ of a basket and just hopes that a man stumbling around is enough to make it \u0096 for me personally, it wasn't.",
         "Mr. Magoo is at times silly, and at others, very silly. But always funny. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a late-night movie. But if your looking for a substantial movie with anything serious about it, forget it! This is a movie for when you're staying up way too late and need some good laughs, or any time you need some good laughs for that matter! Larry Nielson is in high form, with marvelous comedy from the supporting cast, a winner in my opinion: don't hesitate to take this one home with you!",
         "Leslie Nielsen is the best thing about 'Mr. Magoo'. Like always, the late legend delivers a spirited & lovable performance, that, truly, translates into this film's biggest merit. 'Mr. Magoo' Synopis: The myopic millionaire defeats jewel smugglers in his usual bumbling manner. As a film, 'Mr. Magoo' is fairly entertaining. Some jokes work, while some aren't really appealing or funny. The Screenplay isn't great, but fair nonetheless. Stanley Tong's Direction, is decent. Cinematography & Editing, are strictly okay. Performance-Wise: Apart from Nielsen, there is no performance in particular that stands out. All the actors abroad apart from Nielsen, lend ordinary to good support. On the whole, 'Mr. Magoo' is a fair entertainer."
