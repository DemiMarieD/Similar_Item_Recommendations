It also houses one of my very favourite Christopher Walken performances. When I see Martin Sheen be such a jerk here, it both makes me realize where his son Charlie gets that side of his personality from and makes me fear, even though I'm Canadian, the fact that Donald Trump actually has a chance of being the next president of the United States. It also reaffirms in my heart the great adoration I have for Brooke Adams.",

      "synopsis": "In the Maine small town of Castle Rock, school teacher Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) takes his fiancée sweetheart Sarah (Brooke Adams) to an amusement park. On the roller coaster, he suffers a bad headache and tells her that he must go home to sleep it off. Sarah begs him to stay, but he declines saying: \"some things are worth waiting for\". As he drives home, a tanker jackknifes in front of him and he ploughs into it and black out. Johnny wakes up at the Weizak Clinic. His parents Herb and Vera (Sean Sullivan and Jackie Burroughs) are shown in by Dr. Sam Weizak (Herbert Lom). They tell him that he has been in a coma for five years and Sarah has married another man. The distraught Johnny is inconsolable. One day, as a nurse mops his brow he seizers her hand. He has a super-real vision of being trapped in a screaming girl's bedroom. He tells the nurse: \"Amy needs your help.\" The nurse knows that Amy is her daughter's name, but puzzled why Johnny knows her. The nurse rushes home to find her house in flames, but her daughter is safe. After a few weeks of physical therapy, Johnny is able to walk again with some difficulty. When Johnny gratefully takes Dr Weizak's hand, he is jolted by another vision. It is wartime with burning buildings, advancing tanks. A protesting young boy is lifted into a horse-drawn cart, leaving his mother behind. Johnny tells Weizak that his mother survived. Weizak says that it is impossible, but Johnny knows her name and address. Weizak checks it out and it's true, but he cannot bring himself to speak to his elderly mother. Weizak comes back and tells Johnny: \"you're either in possession of a very new human ability... or a very old one.\" Sarah comes to visit Johnny. Catching his stare, she asks him not to look at her that way. He says that he can't help it while Sarah says that it's been five years, but Johnny remembers it as yesterday. She says that she now has a five-year-old son, named Denny. Johnny takes it well. She tells him that his power of \"second sight\" is the talk of the town. Against Weizak's advice, Johnny gives a press conference to defuse the situation. Cynical TV reporter Dardis (Peter Dvorsky) demands a demonstration. Aware that he is being mocked, Johnny takes his hand and says \"You wanna know why your sister killed herself?\" Taken off guard, Dardis calls Johnny a freak. Johnny's distressed parents watch the event on their TV and his mother collapses. At the hospital, Johnny holds her hand as she dies. Johnny moves in with his father. A few days later, Sheriff Bannerman (Tom Skerritt) pays him a visit for his help to catch a serial killer known as the \"Castle Rock killer\". Johnny refuses. When Herb tells Johnny that he should use his power he's been blessed with, Johnny becomes furious. He thinks that his power is a curse, not a gift. One day, Sarah brings her son over when Walt (her husband) is out. She puts Denny to bed and says: \"haven't we waited long enough?\" They finally have sex for the first time in five years. After watching another TV program about the Castle Rock killer, Johnny calls Sheriff Bannerman and agrees to help. Bannerman and Officer Dodd (Nicholas Campbell) take him to the scene of the latest murder, but Johnny gets nothing - he advises Bannerman that in order to get something, he needs a physical article that the killer was in contact with. Bannerman is called to another murder scene at the park bandstand where there is a woman's frozen corpse. Dodd identifies the woman as Alma Frechette. John takes the dead woman's hand and instantly \"sees\" a man calling to her from the bandstand. \"She knows him\" says Johnny. He watches helplessly as she is killed with a pair of scissors. The killer is revealed to be Dodd. As Bannerman calls for him, but he leaves in his squad car. At Dodd's house, Johnny arrives where his mother tries to prevent him from entering. Johnny takes her by the arm and sees that she knew her son was the killer all along and she has been protecting him. Mrs. Dodd calls Johnny a devil, sent from hell, and that her son has been killing all \"dirty women\" in Castle Rock for their sins at her own encouragement. In an upstairs bathroom, Dodd impales himself on the scissors just as Johnny forces himself into the room. Dodd's equally deranged mother takes his gun and shoots Johnny in his shoulder. Sheriff Bannerman runs is and is forced to shoot and kill her to save Johnny's life. Following this close brush with death, Johnny moves out of town to a remote cabin. His bullet injury eventually heals, but his headaches are getting worse. He takes private tutoring jobs, and he is persuades by millionaire Roger Stuart (Anthony Zerbe) to teach his introverted son Chris. Johnny arrives at the Stuart mansion as a loud and abrasive politician named Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) is leaving. Johnny and Chris get along well, to Stuart's relief. Later, Johnny and Chris watch TV coverage to Stillson's campaign for state senator. Stuart says that Stillson is probably a liar and dangerous. In a local newspaper office, editor Brenner is confronted by Stillson and his henchman/sidekick Sonny who demand that he retract an anti-Stillson editorial in the next edition. Producing photographs of Brenner with a young woman (possibly manufactured), they threaten to \"take his head off\" if he doesn't do as they say. At one of Johnny's tutoring session with Chris, he gets interrupted by a knock on the front door and it is Sarah whom is a Stillson campaign volunteer bringing him a brochure to vote for Stillson. Another man appears at the door and Sarah introduces him as Walt, her husband. After an uneasy introduction, they leave and Johnny breaks down. As Chris hugs him for comfort, Johnny has another vision of kids in hockey uniforms and falling through the ice of a frozen lake. One of them is Chris. Johnny goes to Stuart and insists he call off the kids ice hockey practice, or they'll drown. Stuart angrily fires Johnny despite Chris' pleas. The next day at a local news stand, Johnny reads a headline about two boys drowning in a skating accident. He calls Stuart's house, hanging up in relief when Chris answers. Apparently he heeded Johnny's warning not to go play hockey. Meanwhile, Stillson's next rally takes place in a park opposite Johnny's house. Looking for Sarah, Johnny finds himself in Stillson's path. As they shake hands, another vision strikes: at Camp David, President Stillson orders a general to co-authorize an all-out nuclear missile launch against the USSR and the entire world which will bring on Armageddon. Stillson is shaken by Johnny's grasp, until Sonny pushes Johnny away. Johnny goes to Dr. Weizak where he asks him that if he could go back in time knowing what he knows, would he kill Adolf Hitler? Weizak answers, 'I would have no choice but to kill the sonofabitch.' He thinks that the \"dead zone\" in Johnny's visions means that as well as seeing the future, he can also change it. Seeing he must kill Stillson before he becomes President of the USA and brings on the end of the world through nuclear war, Johnny packs up his hunting rifle and takes a bus to the Castle Rock Civic Hall. He breaks into the hall where Stillson will appears the next day and lies in wait on the balcony with the rifle. As the hall fills, the charismatic Stillson arrives and invites Sarah and Denny onto the stage with him as he gives his speech. On the balcony, Johnny rises and takes aim. Sarah sees him and screams and as a result the shot misses. As the spectators panic and fleet the hall, the equally panicked Stillson snatches Denny from Sarah and uses him as a shield. John hesitates to fire again, and gets shot by Sonny and other security detail. Johnny falls from the balcony and lands on the floor onto some chairs. A youth photographs it all before running out of the hall. Paranoid as always, Stillson walks up and grabs Johnny after recognizing him from a few days ago and demands to tell him who hired him. Johnny grabs Stillson's wrist and has a final vision where he sees a drunken and distraught Stillson in his office where there is a Newsweek magazine on his desk with the front cover of the photo of Stillson using Denny as a shield with the headline \"No Future For Stillson\". Beside the Newsweek magazine are other magazines and newspaper headlines with the same photo describing Stillson's cowardice. Stillston takes a gun from his desk and commits suicide. Johnny smirks at Stillson and weakly says: \"It's over. You're finished.\" Stillson orders Sonny and the rest of his men to run out and find the youth who took the photos, leaving the hall empty except for Sarah and Denny. Johnny tells Sarah that his mission is accomplished and then dies.",

         "\"The Dead Zone\" is one of the few King novels turned into really good movies. It is very true to the book in its first two thirds and integrates some nice new elements in the last. Making Sarah a supporter of Greg Stillson was a brilliant idea that adds a bit more intensity to the finale. Some details of the novel are only hinted at or cut out entirely (Johnny's mother's religious delusion, his first accident on the ice, the Wheel Of Fortune, etc), but compromises have to be made when turning a book with 500 pages into a feature length movie and I think the right editing choices have been made. \"The Dead Zone\" is not only an overlooked gem when it comes to Stephen King adaptations, it's also one of Cronenberg's best directing jobs, not very typical of his work, but pretty timeless. Sure, nowadays the accident at the beginning, Johnny's visions and the shootout at the end would be made more gripping and spectacular, but those minor flaws don't really make the movie seem all that dated. Of course, having read the book I enjoyed the movie as a portrayal of events I had pictured in my mind before. I don't know, if \"The Dead Zone\" is thrilling to first time viewers, too, since the plot leaps a little, being a series of episodes rather than one continuous story. After all, I believe that Christopher Walken's performance is strong enough to carry most of the story and make you care about this character and his fate. In fact, all the roles have been cast pretty accurately to my personal imagination. This movie is an artifact of the times when Hollywood's most important directors would fight for the opportunity to adapt one of Stephen King's novels. It's every bit as enjoyable as \"The Shining\" as a movie, it's just based on an inferior model. Still, \"The Dead Zone\" can be recommended to King fans as well as those who are indifferent to his work.",
         "I'm a great admirer of David Cronenberg, and \"The Dead Zone' could well be his most underrated movie. The problem is that it's just not very Cronenbergesque, and being \"Deprave\" Cronenberg's first mainstream Hollywood movie, and coming hot off his provocative and mind blowing 'Videodrome', many people regard it as some kind of sell out. I really cannot agree. If you forget your preconceived idea of what Cronenberg movies SHOULD be (and let's not forget his other career oddities 'Fast Company' or 'M. Butterfly'), and just accept it for what it is, you'll see that it is a very well made and well acted thriller, and is almost impossible to fault. In my opinion it joins Kubrick's 'The Shining' and De Palma's 'Carrie' as the most effective Steven King adaptations to date. Christopher Walken is on top form here, and I think gives one of his very best performances. The supporting cast are also excellent, the lovely Brooke Adams ('Invasion Of The Body Snatchers'), horror veteran Herbert Lom ('Mark Of The Devil'), Martin Sheen ('Badlands'), Tom Skerritt ('Alien'), Anthony Zerbe ('The Omega Man'), and Cronenberg regular Nicholas Campbell, who is involved in the movies most unforgettable sequence. I've lost track of how many times I've watched 'The Dead Zone' over the years, but it never fails to hook me in, and I always get something more out of Walken's performance every time I view it. This movie may not be typical fare from David Cronenberg, but it is one of his most straightforward and entertaining films. Highly recommended.",
         "This movie has been running on the pay channels lately, and I have been watching repeatedly. I saw this movie years ago, and I never took the time to read the book. Therefore, I picked up the book and read it. I have read probably 25 Steven King books and in every case the book is always better than the movie, here was the first. The movie The Dead Zone is by far superior to the book. The book of course has more detail and characters, but the book's characters are boring. Martin Sheen as Greg Stillson was a perfect fit. The changes in the story, (without giving away the movie), where much better in the movie than in the book. A fun suggestion, read the book, and then watch the movie. See if I'm right\u0085\u0085.",
         "The Dead Zone, along with The Shining and Salem's Lot (1979) is probably one of the best cinematic adaptions of a Stephen King novel. The Dead Zone centers around young schoolteacher John Smith (the awesome Christopher Walken) who leads a pretty normal life in a small town in Maine. John is a nice young man with a classroom full of students who like him, a pretty girlfriend he wants to marry and a good relationship with his mom and dad. But late one night, a horrific car accident takes all of that away from him...and replaces it with the gift - or is it the curse? - of precognition. John awakens from a five year coma to find his girlfriend married to another man, his job long gone and his parents much more feeble and shaken. But the one thing he does have - and isn't sure he wants - is a powerful ability to see both into the past and the future. Everyone he touches is an open book - the nurse whose house is burning down, the doctor whose mother escaped Nazi occupied Poland, the reporter whose sister killed herself...and a brutal serial killer who is raping and strangling young women. But the worst is yet to come. John meets an eager and ruthless politician (Martin Sheen) who is determined to get into the White House and declare nuclear war in the name of God. John finally decides to make use of his harrowing visions and sets out to change the future, even if it means he will not live to see it for himself. This is an emotional, sorrowful tale of loss, grief and sacrifice. John is no superhero, no butt-kicking killing machine out to stomp the bad guys. He's a sad, lonely man with a limp and a terrible case of bad luck. The pain of John Smith haunts the expressive face of Christopher Walken throughout the entire film, and the rage he feels at the rotten hand that life has dealt him is understandable, believable and shattering. This is a man who has suffered every pain and loss that a man can suffer, yet is still determined to make the world a safe place for those he loves, even if it means losing them forever. John is indeed one of screendom's saddest heroes - accessible, believable and heartbreaking. Christopher Walken is thoroughly convincing in his performance here: very likable and, at the same time, frighteningly intense. The cold, eternal winter in which the film takes place just reinforces the sense of loneliness and alienation. The violence is brief, but shocking, and the images are so powerful that they remain with you long after the film ends. Martin Sheen is also incredibly good as the dangerously psycho politician, and Brooke Adams is the dark ghost of regret as John's true love, Sarah. This is a powerful, unforgettable film, whether you consider it a mystery, a horror-thriller or a tragic love story. Don't miss it, if you can help it. 10 huge stars!",
         "A schoolteacher Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) a survivor of a road accident awakes from a five-year coma to discover he has psychic abilities, which he gets visions of the past, present and the deadly future. And how he does it, is through the use of touch. But life has changed within that time with his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) being married; he's basically crippled and no longer having a job. So now he uses his abilities to help a sheriff (Tom Skerritt) solve a murder case, to save a child's life and predicting world's fate from an evilly corrupt politician (Martin Sheen) who plans to be president. It's definitely one of my favourite King adaptations and you could say Cronenberg at his best. This time around Cronenberg has taken a more mainstream (even though depressing) approach with none of his grotesque and disturbing visuals evident, but that doesn't take away from the experience - as on show is good story telling, performances and film-making. Visually the film does hold strong imagery (especially the vision scenes) and also the picture truly captures the unsaturated colours of the wintry backdrop, which makes the bleak atmosphere such a dour affair. Though the sharp stabbing sounds when Johnny gets a vision truly knocks you, but it's the stinging outcome that made the film for me. Distinctive photography by Mark Irwin was beautifully constructed and pretty smooth in the detail of the settings. While, the driving score stood out and was particularly on the spot with capturing the right mood. Sound performances are given by the likes of the sympathetic Christopher Walken and the innocent Brooke Adams. Martian Sheen delivers a rather hammy performance and Tom Skerritt's performance is the total opposite, being rather toned down. Cronenberg's solid direction paces the film swiftly and also creates some well-staged sequences of tension that stick in your head. In all you can always expect dashing film-making by Cronenberg and that's what you get in this picture. The story is what I had some gripes with. At times it felt like writer Jeffrey Boam was trying to squeeze too much into the story. Some interesting and intelligent sub-plots (murder investigation) felt hurried and rather contrived - it was like it was concentrating and building more towards the final act instead. But then again time is money and it didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of this film. The plot is basically a portrait of a man coming to grips with his pain and accepting the fate his been chosen and also throw in some social commentary into the mix. Also added is the occasional dabbing of dry/witty remarks, but for me it was uncomfortable humour. That being pretty much the state of the film. One thing I noticed, but don't know if this symbolism was intended but the way Johnny is always wearing the black coat reminded me of death (fate). Especially with touch his can see into the future and actually alter what can happen (say death). Maybe it was just I? It isn't gut wrenching stuff (visually speaking) we've come to expect by Cronenberg, but still he nails down a well drawn up and gripping drama/thriller.",
         "David Cronenberg's \"The Dead Zone\" is certainly one of the best -- if not THE best -- adaptations of any Stephen King novel on film. It holds up as well now as it did on its premiere over twenty years ago. Among its strengths are Jeffrey Boam's screenplay -- this adaptation catches all the essentials of King's story (losing only some of the mood-setting backstories), cuts some of the novel's dross, and adds a few spot-on creative tweaks of its own (e.g. the references to Poe and Irving, quite appropriate given hero Johnny Smith's profession). The acting is excellent throughout, from the starring roles down through smaller parts such as the hero's parents. I also love the moody, haunting score by Michael Kamen, which is a masterly adaptation of, and variation on, a theme from the second symphony of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. Be forewarned, however, that \"The Dead Zone\" is no horror movie in the sense of featuring vampires, ghosties, werewolves, or zombies. It might be called a thriller or even, loosely, science fiction, in the sense that it operates from the hypothetical \"what-if?\" premise of precognition, or seeing into the future. It could even be called a tragedy. There is certainly a terrible sense of loss over the star-crossed love of Johnny and Sarah at the end of this doom-laden story.",
         "It seems that movies starring Christopher Walken just can't go wrong! David Cronenberg's adaptation of Stephen King's \"The Dead Zone\" features him in one of his most interesting roles as literature teacher Johnny Smith, who becomes psychic after surviving a car wreck. He uses his newfound power to help people avoid danger, but soon faces a moral dilemma when it looks like political candidate Greg Stilson (Martin Sheen) may become the next Hitler. This is one of those movies that has shades of everyone involved in it. Walken's eerie presence, Sheen's (apparent) \"aw shucks\" demeanor, plus the horrific feeling of Cronenberg and King. You're sure to love it. Also starring are Brooke Adams as Johnny's ex hubby, and Herbert Lom as a doctor (you may expect him to launch into an anti-Clouseau diatribe, but his role here is as far removed from Commissioner Dreyfus as possible). Very well done.",
         "THE DEAD ZONE (1983) ***1/2 Christopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Colleen Dewhurst, Martin Sheen. David Cronenberg directed this exceptional adaptation of Stephen King's successful chilling novel about sad-eyed school teacher Johnny Smith (eerily personified by the always wonderful Walken) who after hurtled into a coma from a car accident, resurrects to find himself with clairvoyant powers by the simple touch with another human being. Effectively creepy at times and nice use of snow engulfed Maine as its setting. One of Walken's uncanniest performances and one of his own personal faves (which he lampooned later to much hilarity on a 'Saturday Night Live' skit ).",
         "Well-done big screen adaptation of the Stephen King novel is one of the most acclaimed King-based films ever, and rightfully so. School teacher awakens from a five year coma to discover that he has the power to see into a person's past or future trauma by merely touching them. The story that drives this solid thriller is a well-rounded and often moving character study. It's a compelling tale with some great sequences of suspense and the occasional good jolt. Director David Cronenberg delivers splendidly well-shot sequences in this film, as well as a nice atmospheric kind of bleakness that's completely in tune with our story. The music score is also quite beautiful. The cast is the best highlight however. Star Christopher Walken does perhaps one of his best performances as our tormented hero, whom we build quite a bond with. Brook Adams is quite good as Walken's lost love. Martin Sheen is impressive as a sinister politician. Tom Skerritt and Colleen Dewhurst are also good in their small roles. All around The Dead Zone is a wonderful film, even if you're not a fan of Stephen King. Remade as a TV series in 2002 *** 1/2 out of ****",
         "One of the unwritten laws of the movies is that Stephen King books are nearly always disappointing when transferred to the big screen. One film which doesn't fit that rule is The Dead Zone. In the hands of David Cronenberg, you may expect this to be a gore-filled affair, but it is actually a very well-made, subtle film which emphasises the psychological sense of fear rather than settling for blood-spattered mayhem. There isn't a moment in the film that will make you jump out of your seat, but it is still an effectively scary film because it plays on your mind. Normal, down-to-earth everyman Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) is involved in a terrible car crash which leaves him comatose. Four years later, he miraculously awakens. To begin with, he is devastated to learn that his girlfriend has moved on, marrying and starting a family with another man. But soon he realises that this is the least of his problems. He soon discovers that the accident has left him with remarkable powers, which enable him to see into people's futures just by touching their hand. And Johnny is in for one hell of a nasty shock when he shakes hands with potential senator Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) at a political rally.... An intelligently paced and very well-acted film, The Dead Zone is also full of unpredictable plot developments. Walken elicits great sympathy as the normal guy who rapidly learns that his new gift is actually a curse, and there are fabulous supporting performances from Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Brooke Adams and the terrifying Martin Sheen. The film has several tremendous moments, but the climax in particular builds to an emotional crescendo. The premise of The Dead Zone is probably rather silly if you stop to think about it, but other than that it is a most impressive film - and still ranks as one of, if not THE, best adaptation of a Stephen King story so far."
