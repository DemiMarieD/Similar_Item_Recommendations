         "If this quirky British comedy could be summed up in a word, that word would be \"charming\". The story is a simple, low-budget British one: two orphans scam as many people as they can for as much money as they can in an effort to buy the stately home they always dreamed of as children. Everything is going swimmingly, until they join forces with a typist, Georgie (the perfect Kate Beckinsale), and the plot leads on from there... The acting is perfect for the film, neither overstated nor low key, and suits the plot and style very well. The direction is quirky, but makes no new ground, and also fits the script to a tee. This film would be great viewing for a date (perhaps not for a lads night in), and has the simple comedy you might expect from such classic British TV series as \"Only Fools and Horses\", or \"Last of the Summer Wine\". It doesn't require much brain power, but is one of the best homegrown (British) comedies of recent(ish) years.",
         "I first saw this at the cinema, believe it or not, purely on the strength of the fact that it uses 'Me And You Versus the World' by Space as the title music. I'm so glad that I did. The film is a lightweight romp with implausible but thoroughly likeable characters. It isn't a thought provoking piece of angst, but then it never ever professes to be. I now own this on dvd, and after several watches it still remains fresh and engaging and never fails to put a smile on my face. There's no individual outstanding component in this film, but it's one that I just *keep* coming back to. Superb fun.",
         "I have seen this film so many times and never get sick of it. The casting is brilliant with Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend in fantastic performances. The plot is quite original following Dylan and Jez - two English con artists who are tricking people out of their money by selling voice recognition computers and other false devices. They need two million dollars to buy the house they never had - having grown up as orphaned children. On one of their scams they employ a secretary and medical student named Georgie, who is convinced they are raising money for an orphans project. This adds romantic themes into the story to make it even more entertaining. A stand out is the interesting relationship that Dylan and Jez have with each other, Dylan being the fast talking American and Jez being the British techno genius. I recommend 'Shooting Fish' to all movie-goers. It has a great soundtrack, is funny, romantic, creative and a great achievement for British filmmaking.",
         "Take a couple of con men who see an opportunity to separate a mark from his money in just about everything, throw in an attractive young woman with an altruistic agenda, blend together for about ninety-three minutes and the result is `Shooting Fish,' an amiable, entertaining comedy, directed by Stefan Schwartz. It's the story of two guys who grew up in orphanages on opposite sides of the ocean, Dylan (Dan Futterman) in America, Jez (Stuart Townsend) in England; and who, by the time they had reached the age of consent, had each been endowed with a particular talent: Dylan has the gift of gab, Jez is a technical wizard. Dylan's gift has quickly gotten him into hot water with the wrong kind of people, however, and to stay healthy (read: `Alive') he flees to England, where he meets Jez. And it's a friendship/partnership born in scam/scheme heaven. If there's a way to make a fast buck, they know it-- from selling bogus computers, to selling insulation for homes that's never installed, to entering any and every contest that comes down the pike. If there's a nickel in it, they're in. Then one day they hire a girl from the temp pool to help them out with one of their scams. Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) is beautiful, smart, and has a cause she's trying to fund, so she needs the job; but from day one she's on to what Dylan and Jez are trying to pull. She stays on board, however, when Dylan convinces her that they are something like modern day Robin Hoods-- that the money they're `raising' is going to orphans. What he doesn't tell her is that the `orphans' he's referring to is them. And Dylan is a born salesman-- not to mention the fact that he's a real charmer-- and the three of them become a real team. Schwartz delivers a film that is in no way exceptional nor particularly memorable, but it is entertaining. It's exactly what it promises to be: a diverting hour and a half or so that provides some laughs and a good time. It's pleasant fare that's inoffensive and features some engaging performances and a story that will keep you involved. There are a couple of scenes, in fact, that are downright hilarious. And Schwartz has good timing and sets a pace that keeps it all moving right along, which, when you add it all up, makes for a satisfying, enjoyable experience. Futterman has a winning personality and a resonant, mesmerizing voice that fits his character perfectly. Dylan is the salesman you hope you'll never meet, because if you do, chances are you'll walk away with the deed to the bridge. He's a likable heel, convincingly brought to life by Futterman (who is probably best known for his role of Vincent Gray in the `Judging Amy' TV series). It's a good performance, and one of the strengths of the film. As Jez, Townsend does a fine job, too, and though he's overshadowed a bit by Dylan-- intentionally the flashier of the two-- Jez is the one who secures the sympathy of the audience. After all, this is the guy who at least seems a bit remorseful as he's taking other people's money and trust. And it's interesting to compare Townsend's fairly reserved performance here with his role of the vampire Lestat in the more recent `Queen of the Damned.' He's a fine young actor whose style contrasts nicely with Futterman, and along with Beckinsale they make quite the team of scam artists. The one who draws the attention, however, is the lovely and charismatic Kate Beckinsale, who is beguiling in the role of Georgie. She makes her character accessible, and plays her with a savvy, rather than naive sensibility, and it's a portrayal that works well. Most importantly, she makes Georgie real, with a winsome appeal that makes you care about her and what happens to her. She's the most grounded of the trio, and it's her character that keeps the story within the realm of credibility. This may not be the stuff Oscars are made of, but it's an enjoyable, engaging performance that will win you over, without question. The supporting cast includes Rowena Cooper (Jez's Teacher), Myles Anderson (Jez, aged 8), Jacob Macoby (Dylan, aged 8), Jane Lapotaire (Dylan's Headmistress), Tom Chadbon (Mr. Greenaway), Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Ross), Peter McNamara (Geoff), Arabella Weir (Mrs. Stratton-Luce), Nickolas Grace (Mr. Stratton-Luce) and Claire Cox (Floss). An easy-going comedy with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes, `Shooting Fish' is a solid, feel good film that will put a smile on your face and provide a pleasant evening's entertainment. And in the final analysis, that's not such a bad deal; and it's all a part of the magic of the movies. I rate this one 7/10.",
         "Shooting Fish was something I got out on a risk, you know.....no other film in video store, take a chance. It proved to be a wise decision as the film was very funny, two great opposites for the main male characters and the stunning kate beckinsale acted the part wonderfully. The film has no slow points, but does not rush things, the accompanying music is very good and acting first class. I would recommend this film to anyone",
         "Normally when it comes to voting for movies on the IMDb, I'm quite liberal. I don't set very high standards for movies. I always tend to rate films based on how much I enjoy them and this means that most of the time I always rate films highly cos I try and find something good in every film I see. I saw this film when I was vacationing in England. BBC One actually transmitted this at 11 PM, since they believed that The Peacemaker was a film more deserving of the 9:00 slot. Unlike the Peacemaker, Shooting Fish is a film that almost anybody would enjoy, unless he/she was the kind of person who found simple effective storytelling a turnoff. Everything about this movie seems in perfect harmony. The chemistry between Dan Futterman and Stuart Townsend is perfect, word for word. And Kate Beckinsale is a perfect third piece to the puzzle; When the conversations in the movie occur, you never get the feeling you're watching a contrived conversation written by someone else, you get the feeling you're watching real life unfold. That's a hallmark of a good scriptwriter and the people who wrote this deserve credit for the story. As for the story itself, it never lets itself become too complicated and lends itself to a lot of funny situations. Fast-talking Dylan and socially naive Jez (Futterman and Townsend) are two con men trying to raise money to build their dream house. They end up enlisting Georgina's (short-haired Kate Beckinsale in a beautiful role from her pre-Hollywood Glamourpuss days) help on a particular scam. Soon she discovers what they're up to and the story unfolds from there, with both Dylan and Jez seemingly falling for Georgie. Here again, the movie doesn't nosedive and morph into a conventional love story; rather, the romance builds in a backdrop to the main story and culminates in a heartwarming finale. As for Dan and Jez, some of their schemes may not be very believable and yet you cant help but be amused by the way they go about implementing them. This film is a good reason why small budget comedy romances are popular - simply put, they work. On every level. Watching this film gives you the same kind of feeling as watching While you were Sleeping, for example. For the sheer sweetness of the film and for Kate Beckinsale's performance, I'd give it 7 on 10.",
         "This movie is brilliant. The scams these guys pull are genius and the comic timing is superb. The first scam deals with artificial intelligence and the exaggeration grows as they scam more people. The lead American actor is really handsome, too. This one is right up there with Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, except without the violence.",
         "This movie is practically my all time favorite. At least favorite comedy. It is absolutely brilliant, with lovely actors hilarious script, everything really. Jez (Stuart Townsend) is very cute and just incredible. Georgie (Kate Beckinsale) is almost like I would have wanted to be if I could choose. I love this movie so much, and I laughed just as much when I'd seen it three times as after the first.",
         "So I just caught this movie, years after it first came out.... and loved it! The lead characters are perfectly cast, complimenting each others performances wonderfully throughout. Ok, so I knew from scene one that it was all going to turn out for the best in the end, but it was the sort of movie where I didn't care! Great comedy situations, and strong writing ensured a thoroughly enjoyable experience. N.B - No review of this film would be complete without a mention of the fantastic soundtrack. From 60's American, past 90's Britpop, and culminating in the utterly magical workings of Neil Hannon - it was a joy to listen to.",
         "This movie is simply great. While it perhaps lacks a larger social message, other than the simple \"do good with what you have\", it is a smart, funny movie which definitely has its moments, both cinematic and dramatic. The rags to riches story of two orphan con men: one, a genius Brit, the other, the American spin doctor. Together they engage in \"shooting fish\", or fleecing rich people of their extra cash, in order to buy themselves the lavish house they've each coveted because of their simple upbringing. The story is fun and engaging, the characters seem very very real, and the different cons they pull off together are extremely funny. I won't give away any of the story, except to say that the has a nice, unexpected twist. An excellent date movie, or even to take in with a couple of close friends. You may not laugh out loud the whole time like you did at \"There's Something About Mary\" or other slapstick comedies, but you'll definitely be smiling the whole time, and by the time the credits role you'll simply be in a much better mood than you were when you started."

         "Dylan and Jez are con artists, Dylan is a charming American who's run from some characters in the states and Jez is an English techno nerd. During one of their scams selling a voice recognition computer they hire Georgie as a secretary for the job. The romantic triangle between Dylan, Jez and Georgie appears, but she is also not a secretary, but a student, and her marriage with rich Roger is upcoming.",
         "Jez, the goofy, British tech genius, and Dylan, the smarmy fast-talking Yank, are orphans. They're also con artists out to \"shoot some big fish\" (trick some people out of their money). See, they need two million pounds to buy the home they never had. Things get complicated when a typist they hire for a \"job\" turns out to be sweeter than any scam. Both gents are tripped up for Georgie who is convinced that they're modern Robin Hoods raising money for orphans. Turns out she needs the money worse than they: to save the family home which doubles as a home for special needs children. When Jez and Dylan land in jail during a financial crisis (all the fifty pound notes in the land are being reclaimed because the Queen doesn't like her picture), they have to put their faith and their cash in Georgie's hands. What's a girl to do with two million pounds?",
         "Two confidence tricksters, one British and one American and both brought up in orphanages, live in a disused but far from dull gasometer. On one of their scams they employ Georgie, secretary and medical student, who is at first horrified by their occupation. When rogues steal her research notes the lads get their own back - ending up flogging roof insulation - and Georgie starts to feel part of the team.",
