Gage steals $100,000 in a multiple-felony robbery so that Diamond can record a full album, not knowing it's Mr. B's money he's taken.

      "reviews": [
         "This is a film where you think the hero is a good person, but he usually does some stupid things that in a moral movie woulnd't be redeemable. But not here. Pras has a fair performance here as a rap star who wants to make it big, legitimately, but he has to worry about his long time record producer, drug pusher and friend (Ja Rule in a not too bad first role), his father who returned after a 12 year absence and his girlfriend (Tamala Jones) who is pregnant. A couple of good points on the black music industry (literaly and figuratively) and a couple of stand out performances are cluttered by a lame excuse for a music video plot. Oh well, I guess you could catch this type of thing here, or somewhere else. Jason Statham is exceptional though as a british drug dealer, but even he can't help much. C+",
         "I felt ripped off. With Pras Michel and Ja Rule ringleading this Glitter-turned-rap film, I thought it would real cool. How naive am I? Although none of the actors were terrible (although Ja could do with a few acting lessons... given that its his first time I'll forgive him, but he should stick to what he does best) they're not good either. Pras and his lady-friend are about the ONLY people among the masses that look as though they know what they're doing. Also, what the hell is up with everybody you ever get to see in the film (minus a select few) being killed? And then having an ending that's supposed to envoke sad emotions - you don't feel bad for the people because you didn't care about them in the first place! In conclusion, if you don't like violence or continued use of the word 'n***a' then don't Turn It Up, turn it off! It's no wonder this thing didn't make any money - it grossed less than 1.5 million! 2/10",
         "First of all, Pras CANNOT act. He can barely speak english. He mumbles his entire dialouge and has no presence whatsoever. He was horrible! Ja Rule was better but that's not saying much. These two have no business in front of a camera. The story was AWWWWWWWWFULL. The camera work was terrible. Whoever directed this has NO TALENT. And whoever financed this movie is CRAZY! The only thing i liked was the rear shot of the girlfriend (tamala jones) walking into the kitchen. But even then , she grabs for her top as if she has family members present on the set. The music in the movie was terrible. Pras would have been booed off stage with that performance. And he should have gotten slapped for wearing a freaking white leather \"elvis\"-like suit on stage in an underground hip-hop club. The only film worse is \"Corrupted\" with Silk the Shocker and Ice-T. OMG. That has to be no doubt THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! I give that a -10 out of 10. This one i give a 1 out of 10.",
         "this film was sad, the plot was hard to swallow only cause the poor acting job everyone did. The only reason i saw it was cause my uncle is in it. Even then all he dose is get shot and thats done poorly. All and all unintentionaly funny.",
         "Very disappointing movie about a musician and his friend (Ja Rule aka the biggest sellout) who deliver weight in order to make money to fund the production of an album. This movie is a really bad rip off of the movies Belly and Juice. The acting is awful the lines the actors use are even worse, and how in the world was the budget for this movie 9 million dollars?? anyway avoid this movie I give it 2/10.",
         "The movie was decent. But Pras lacks acting ability, which really dragged the movie down some. His total, straight face, no emotion performance was needed during a few scenes but the rest of the movie he needed to show some kind of emotions or at least facial expressions which were not there. Ja Rule did a great job in his first role and had some great lines to work with. Worth renting but not buying.",
         "I saw this on Black Starz late at night. This is really bad, it's a fake wanna-be Belly with some terrible acting(especially Ja-Rule and Pras), the script was just flat-out lame, the shootout scenes were unrealistic like said earlier here and once again Ja-Rule was in it which made the movie worse than it already was and the live performances weren't any good neither... The only good thing about this movie was the scoring by Frank Fitzpatrick, other than that.. a str8 up embarrassment 1/10 - GAABAGE..",
         "Turn It Up comes off like a fake Belly, which is a much better film. The gun battles are generic and the cinematography is bland. But Ja Rule as Gage, makes this movie with his peformance. He comes off the flavor that Tupac did in Juice. I don't reccomnded this movie at all."
