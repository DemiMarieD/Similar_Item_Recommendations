      "synopsis": "British soldier Jody (Forest Whitaker) is taken captive by Fergus (Stephan Rea), Jude (Miranda Richardson), Maguire (Adrian Dunbar) and others. He is held to be exchanged for a IRA prisoner the British are holding. During the three days Jody is held, he and Fergus become friends as they talk about their lifes. Jody tells Fergus about his girlfriend back in London named Dil. Jody says she is his type of woman. Jody tells Fergus he won't shoot him when it's time because it's not in Fergus' nature. He tells him a parable about the scorpion and the frog. The scorpion asks the frog to take him across the river because the scorpion can't swim. The frog says no because you'll sting me. The scorpion says trust me. Half way across, the frog feels a sharp sting and says to the scorpion as they sink, why did you sting me? Now we'll both die. I couldn't help it, said the scorpion, it's in my nature. Finally, when it becomes time to shoot Jody, Fergus takes him out into the woods, takes off the hood, but can't shoot him. Jody breaks his bonds and runs away from Fergus. Just as he's getting away, Jody runs unto a road and is run over by a British armored carrier. The carrier and assault troops who are attacking the house where Jody was being held. All the IRA members are killed in the attack except Fergus. Fergus decides to go to London and find Dil. He arranges to get to London and begins working as a day laborer. He goes to the place where Dil works as a hair dresser and then follows her to \"The Metro,\" a corner bar. Col (Jim Broadbent) is the bartender and he begins the discussion between Dil and Fergus, who is now using the name Jimmie. But soon the two of them are talking to one another. Another man comes up to Dil and drags her out and down the street. Fergus follows them as they go to Dil's apartment and he sits outside and watches the shadows in her flat. Another time Fergus is in the bar and talking with Dil and again this rude man comes up. He grabs Dil and they go outside and down an alley. Fergus follows them and he defends Dil and knocks the other man down and tells him to leave her alone. Gradually, Dil and Jimmie (Fergus) become closer. Jimmie asks Dil about the man in the pictures in her flat. The man is Jody and Dil says he is a soldier and he is different from the others. Jimmie and Dil begin making out and Jimmie begins to run his hand up Dil's skirt, but she stops him and then performs oral sex on him. Their relationship begins to grow and Jimmie finds himself becoming more and more fond of Dil. She seems wonderful to him. Finally as their relationship as evolved, they go to Dil's flat and lie down on the bed. Dil goes into the bathroom and changes into a robe. She returns and Jimmie removes the robe and starts down her body. He reaches the genital area and discovers that Dil is a male with a penis. Jimmie is repulsed and runs into the bathroom and vomits. He then runs out of the flat while Dil pleads with him to say something and don't go. After thinking about Dil for a bit, Jimmie realizes he still cares and writes a letter of apology to Dil and puts it in the mail box. Dil shows up at Jimmie's work site and they talk and reconcile. Jimmie still has strong feelings for Dil. Upon his return to his flat, Fergus discovers Jude waiting for him. He thought she had been killed in the attack. She said they were going to kill him for messing up, but he had one more chance and that was an assasination assignment on a man in London. Almost certainly a suicide mission. Fergus realizes he has no choice. Jude makes it clear they are watching Dil, and if Fergus messes up, she will be killed too. Fergus (Jimmie) goes to Dil's flat and talks her into cutting her hair and disguising herself in order to get away to a hotel. But when he leaves the next day to wait for his mission, Dil gets and bottle and heads back to her flat. Jimmie intercepts her and they go upstairs. They fall asleep and when Dil awakes, she ties Jimmie to the bed to prevent him from leaving after she finds a gun in his coat. Jude and Maguire are waiting for Fergus to show and when he doesn't, Maguire tries to do the mission himself and is killed. Jude drives off and heads for Dil's flat. Just as Dil unties Jimmie (Fergus), Jude bursts into the flat with the intent of killing everyone, but Dil gets off the first shots and kills Jude. Jimmie tells her to leave right now and he sits down to wait for the police. The closing scene is in the prison where Jimmie is doing time for the murder (although I would think he could claim self defense). Dil comes to visit him. She asks why he took the rap for her. He begins to tell her about the scorpion and the frog. He ends by saying, it's in my nature.",

         "The less you know about this film, the better. I won't tell you anything except what a well-written and well-acted movie this is. from the first 15 minutes, which is mainly dialogue between two actors, you are completely drawn in to the film, which has almost dream-like qualities. If you were planning to see it just because of the \"twist\" and to see what everyone was talking about, then see it. If you were planning to see it for the amazing script, acting and direction - see it. And if you were planning on not seeing it - see it",
         "THE CRYING GAME / (1992) ***1/2 (out of four) By Blake French: I admire Neil Jordan for contributing his vastly original ideas to theater screens, as do I admire the Academy Awards, who appropriately rewarded \"The Crying Game\" with the best original screenplay Oscar in 1992. The film also earned nominations for best picture, director, leading and supporting actors, and editing. Jordan's style of filmmaking feels consistent over the years. \"The Crying Game\" offers the usual flavor of Jordan, but also incorporates unexpected, ninety degree twists that change the pace of his story altogether. \"The Crying Game\" begins in Northern Ireland, where the IRA takes prisoner a British soldier named Jody (Forest Whitaker). Among the team of committed terrorists is the quiet Fergus (Stephen Rea), and the seductive Jude (Miranda Richardson), who guard Jody in an isolated forest shelter. As Fergus continually watches Jody, the two become begin to like one another. Jody knows that his tragic fate nears, therefore, shows Fergus a photograph of his romantic interest, who lives back in London. He asks Fergus to look her up sometime if he ever gets the chance. The movie takes a ridged, unexpected turn, and the next time we see Fergus, he is living as a construction worker in London under a new name. He finds the soldier's girlfriend working at a beauty salon. Her name is Dil (Jaye Davidson). Fergus gets a haircut, and follows her to a nearby bar, then the next thing we know the two are deeply in love. But Dil has a secret-and so does Fergus. What would Dil think if she knew her new lover was responsible for her late boyfriend's death? Stephen Rae is the best thing in the movie, interlocking the several separate plots with a concrete narrative. The film takes his point of view, and does so consistently. This is essential, since we learn information as he does-a classic yet extraordinarily effective method of keeping an audience involved. Here, Jordan celebrates a clean story, but reveals information about certain characters that change the entire direction of the story, while keeping the important material in play. That is not easy. \"The Crying Game\" is not for everyone-it's a hard, perverse movie with enough content to warrant several R ratings. The sexual content is unexpected and distorted, but stunningly original. Three minutes do not pass before a character casually utters the notorious four-letter word. Even the violence is aggressive and graphic. \"The Crying Game\" takes no prisoners, so hold on tight and come prepared for the ride. I think the film could have investigated the relationship between Dil and Jody with more detail. We learn how Jody feels about Dil, but Dil resists sharing her feelings about Jody. Is this done for a purpose? I think so. Neil Jordan is not the kind of director who would leave out massive plot nuggets like this, especially in a movie as deliberate and complex as \"The Crying Game.\" However, Dil feels a little shallow in this area. With a little more emotion and dimension, she could have been even more intriguing. Jaye Davidson does a great job with the character, however, which probably explains why this element of the story has not received many other complaints. \"The Crying Game\" was certainly one of the most original movies to hit theaters in 1992, and deserved many of its award nominations and wins. Neil Jordan bravely takes us through controversial material, while at the same time, keeps us focused on the main points of the movie. He keeps the audience in his grasp the whole way through-something all directors should strive to accomplish.",
         "From a philosophical viewpoint, this movie illustrates unconditional love, which is not that prevalent in our present world. We could all learn some things from this movie, if we chose to do so. I regret that I am only ten (10) years behind in seeing and understanding this work. The entire cast and crew were excellent in their work and the writer deserves tremendous credit for such insight and understanding of the degree of heart and soul which can and does exist in some people. I would recommend it to anyone who is attempting to understand humanity and some of the trials and tribulations it puts itself through. It is classified as a \"teaching movie\" specializing in unconditional love, or \"fiction with a definite positive purpose\". Beautiful work.",
         "The Crying Game was a sensation when it was first released back in 1992, and looking back on it after all these years it still manages to be an intelligently written and well acted thriller of gender-bending proportions. It famously features one of the most startling plot twists ever conceived for film (which has since become well known; if you're fortunate enough not to know what it is, I will give you the pleasure of discovering it for yourself.). At the time of its release the \"plot twist\" in question was the main subject of discussion regarding The Crying Game; in retrospect, it is seen not just to be a gimmick, but also an ingenious narrative device--it fits organically with the rest of the plot, both before the revelation and after. Finally, The Crying Game is actually a film that deals with the universal theme of one's need to find acceptance and love in this world (This fact adds new dimensions to its theme song). And because it deals with such a universal theme, this film, like all great films, stands the test of time.",
         "The only reason I watched The Crying Game was because I had heard it was pretty good and it is from the same director as The Interview with the Vampire. Plus it was on TV. The film really surprised me. It was wonderfully made and had a great twist. The performances were real and profound. The writing was some of the best in years. And the direction was outstanding. And the costume design, art direction, makeup, and score were all amazing. The song The Crying Game also caught me as particularly wonderful. The Crying Game is a classic in every way. It makes a lasting impression and should be viewed many times. It is a true classic.",
         "Here is a really deep & touching movie. Dil sings (& moves her hands about like a classical Indian dancer rather distractingly) \"I know all about the crying game\" we know that she knows. It drips out of her voice, it rolls down her cheek, it stares out of her eyes. She knows she has lost her best chance in life - the only man to love her was killed in Ireland. Yet when she meets Stephen Rea the man who, unknown to her, was responsible for her lover's (Forest Whitaker) death in Ireland, hope again rises in her. She will hold on to Rea for her life for in him she sees a 'gentleman' very like Whitaker. But Rea is not the only one with a secret. Dil has one too & that gives the movie the tension, irony & ultimately the tragedy which sets it apart from any IRA/ star-crossed lovers/ hostage drama that I have seen. When Dil tells Rea that she knows he is lying but all the same she likes to hear him say that he loves her it moves everyone in the audience. The performances (Adrian Dunbar as the ruthless leader, Miranda Richardson as the cold, teasing assassin & Jim Broadbent as the bartender, not to mention Rea, Dil & Whitaker) are brilliant, the atmosphere is electric & the score is haunting. The only points that rankle are Whitaker's dream-sequence appearances looking like a model in a detergent ad & Dil's suddenly-acquired shooting skills which brings the movie to its horrific climax. A brilliant movie with layers & layers of depth, & comparable to Jordan's earlier 'Mona Lisa'. That is saying a lot because Mona Lisa walks into my Top 50 movies without even knocking!",
         "The first part of The Crying Game is based on a great short story by Frank O'Connor, \"Guests of the Nation.\" The balance of this provocative, brilliantly made film takes you on a journey fueled by guilt, romance, terrorist intrigue, and a plot twist that ranks as one of the most startling in all cinema. The acting, by Forest Whitaker, Stephen Rea, Jaye Davidson, and others, is all first-rate; the cinematography and score are stellar; and Neil Jordan directs with vigor and empathy. How can anyone give this movie less than a 10? I can't.",
         "\"The Crying Game\" is one of those films that you see and you talk about for days after you first see it. A genuine shocker at the time of its release, the film was huge in 1992 and earned a Best Picture nomination from the Academy. The film is a complicated puzzle which involves an IRA volunteer (Stephen Rea in his Oscar-nominated role) who is assigned to guard a British soldier (Forest Whitaker). An unlikely friendship develops and when Whitaker is killed, Rea goes to find his girlfriend who is not at all that she seems. There is no point in giving away her secret to those who have not yet seen this film. However, the twists and turns of \"The Crying Game\" are what make the film work. The movie is flawed in several areas, but overall it is a noble work that ranks real high on the list of other great films of the 1990s. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",
         "N.B. Spoilers within. It's hard to do justice to this modern masterpiece. Let me get this out of the way: \"The Twist.\" The whole issue is a real shame to me; viewers should just stick to the complexities of the story and characters, and not \u0097 as the marketers selling the film would soon glom onto \u0097 a twist. To think that this would go on to nearly define for the world Neil Jordan's incredible movie! (Along with this, the \"I-could-see-it-coming-a-mile-away\" attitude...give me a break and just suspend some disbelief.) It doesn't matter now: the poignancy and importance of what Fergus (Stephen Rea) and Dil (Jaye Davidson) experience in this film have given it staying power. But let's start at the beginning, in Northern Ireland and the IRA, and the kidnapping of British officer Jody (the very solid Forest Whitaker). Here Fergus shows his true colors as a man, befriending Jody \u0097 his hated enemy \u0097 and proving himself something of a human beyond the sworn duties of his terrorist associations. This first 35 minutes of the film will indelibly imprint on everything that happens thereafter. Fergus's bonding with Jody cannot be helped \u0097 because of who the two men are \u0097 even as it complicates the emotions between them. The essential story narrated by Jody of the scorpion and the frog serves as background metaphor for the rest of the story: \"I can't help it\u0085it's in my nature.\" Jody's revealing to Fergus of his distant lover Dil (why did he do it? To pre-avenge the terrorist acts happening to him? Out of pure love and sharing?) lights a fuse for the rest of the film, too. IRA activist and lover of Fergus, Jude (Miranda Richardson) proves herself tough in these opening sequences, but is nothing like the Valkyrie she will emerge as in Act III. Jody is unfortunately dispatched early from the picture, but the damage is done: his work on Fergus's psyche has been cemented. Fergus departs the IRA holdout, now in smithereens, and heads to London, where he becomes Jimmy. He looks up Dil, heavy with the knowledge of how complicit he was in Jody's fate. This, too, takes a constant place in the storyline and must always be kept in mind. (Stephen Rea wears his burdens in the way he talks, walks, breathes: he and Davidson are incredible.) Dil seems to be able to take care of herself just fine (dumping the the dufus Dave, for example), but once she meets Jimmy she falls in love. The feelings are mutual. At the club where Dil performs, bartender Col (a smooth and perfectly knowing Jim Broadbent) mediates the tentative relations between grieving Dil and searching Jimmy/Fergus. So, the decisive moment: the big reveal. Dil says honestly, \"I thought you knew.\" And later (with the film's many touches of grim humor): \"Even while you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.\" Fergus has another dream about Jody afterward: now Jody is not pitching (i.e. sharing) a cricket ball, but strolling away with a smirk and a genuine sense of revenge. But Fergus needn't worry: one of the great themes in this movie is the way he can't help but stick with Dil, no matter who she has turned out to be. It's all about Fergus's (and Dil's) huge capacity for love, which has become far more universal. All comes together breathlessly in the final Act. Jude & co. show up in London and re-recruit Fergus to the cause, an important assassination. Now Jude is ruthless and jealously knows of Dil and Fergus. It's incredibly touching when Fergus shears and disguises Dil to save her life: he has put her in harm's way. (One leitmotif in this movie is the music that accompanies the intimate moments between Fergus and Dil \u0097 a little sugary but very effective.) When Fergus FINALLY reveals to Dil his relationship with Jody, she is too drugged to fully grasp. But soon she will get it, in spades. The collision between love stories and terrorist plot is unforgettable. Jude is unprepared for the emotional force wielded by the liberated Dil, whose feelings for Jody come to the fore as she has learned of how Jude seduced Jody to his capture in Ireland. Now that Dil's secret is out (in the real world), the viewer must be fair to the film and *always* keep him/herself in Fergus and Dil's heads. Their points of view are crucial to taking this film on its own grounds. This is one of the most powerful and intelligent films I've ever seen; a thriller combined with multi-layered love stories. Jordan et. al. have created an utterly absorbing and memorable tale.",
         "This movie is not the average, run of the mill suspense film. It is well acted, with a solid script and very human side to the plot. Jaye Davidson launched a nice career with this surprise. In the end, Crying Game does not take the easy way out and cheat the audience. Neil Jordan made some excellent artistic choices. I am genuinely sorry I missed this film in the theatres and I am pleased I rectified this oversight."

When the hostage-taking ends up going horribly wrong, Fergus escapes and heads to London, where he seeks out Jody's lover, a hairdresser named Dil. Fergus adopts the name \"Jimmy\" and gets a job as a day laborer. He also starts seeing Dil, who knows nothing about Fergus' IRA background. But there are some things about Dil that Fergus doesn't know, either...",
         "Jody, a British soldier on leave, is abducted by the IRA, and held captive outside of Belfast. He is to be used in a prisoner exchange, but the IRA will kill him if need be. Among his captors are Jude, the sexual bait used to lure him, and Fergus, an IRA volunteer who will act as one of his main guards. Through their contact, Jody and Fergus become as close as friends as they can be under the circumstances, and despite both knowing, deep in their hearts, that Jody will most-likely not survive this situation barring an unseen intervention. That friendship is fostered because Jody can sense that Fergus basically has a good heart, from which he cannot run regardless of the situation. Jody's imprisonment does not end quite the way that any of Jody, Fergus or Jude had envisioned. Based on what happens, Fergus decides to go into hiding by moving to London and assuming a new name, Jimmy. But his move to London is primarily to meet Jody's girl, Dil, of who Jody spoke with reverence and care. In the process of being Dil's protector in Jody's absence, Fergus falls for Dil, and visa versa. But Fergus will learn of a fundamental aspect of Dil which may change how he feels for her, and how he interacts with her. In addition, Fergus' IRA past may catch up with him, which may further affect how he wants and decides to interact with Dil. Conversely, Dil may change her mind about \"Jimmy\" if she finds out about \"Fergus\".",
