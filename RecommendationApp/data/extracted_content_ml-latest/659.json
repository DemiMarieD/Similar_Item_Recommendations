      "synopsis": "In Rome, we see Philippe Greenleaf ( Maurice Ronet) and Tom Ripley ( Alain Delon) at a cafe table together; Tom is writing postcards. They chat about Philippe's girlfriend Marge, who he is having trouble with. Philippe gets up when he sees his friend Freddy ( Billy Kearns) and invites him to join them. When Tom is away at a bookstore Philippe tells Freddy that Tom has admitted that it was Philippe's father who had Tom go to Italy to bring Philippe home to America with the promise of a handsome reward. Philippe has no intention of going. Freddy is uneasy about Tom and soon leaves; Philippe has Tom pick up their tab. As they walk down the street Philippe bumps into a blind man. He gives him money, then on Tom's suggestion buys the blind man's cane and gives him money for the taxi home. When Philippe pretends to be blind and stumbles into a car, a young woman takes pity on him and guides him across the street, and she ends up spending the evening with both men in a horse carriage, only later discovering that Philippe is not blind. Full of laughter, she buys the cane and has the carriage stop so she can try walking like a blind woman; she asks them to wait for her, but they instead proceed to a night club. Meanwhile Tom has seen fit to steal some of the lady's jewelry. Next, Philippe and Tom arrive by boat in the coastal town of Mongibello, where Philippe lives. At a local ballet company pre-premiere nerves are on; we see Philippe and Tom bring back a drunken man, O'Brien ( Frank Latimore), the company director. Then they pay a visit to the guitar-playing, Fra Angelico-studying Marge ( Marie Laforêt), who is upset with Philippe for leaving town for several days. They soon make up on the sofa, while Tom goes to the next room, discovers some of Philippe's clothes and puts them on. He looks into the mirror and pretends to be Philippe, but is interrupted by Philippe at the door. Later when Philippe is on his way to the bank for a cash withdrawal, Tom comes to him with a letter from Philippe's father, who is disappointed that Philippe does not seem intent on returning home and consequently discontinues his financial arrangement with Tom. Tom seems haunted and begs Philippe to go to San Francisco so he can get his hands on his father's money. Philippe, Marge and Tom go on a sail boat to join Freddy at Taormina. It's high summer, the sun is hot and the ocean is blue. During a meal Tom talks about how he used to adore Philippe when they were kids, and how Philippe's father didn't want them to be together because Tom wasn't of good enough family. Philippe sends Tom to the steering wheel while he and Marge have some time alone, but Tom overhears Philippe saying to Marge that he is not fond of Tom and that they will soon leave him behind so they can be alone. Tom is upset and deliberately makes the boat shake. Philippe comes up and, faking concern for the boat, tricks Tom into the safety boat, which he lets float after the ship, and retires to the cabin. But the rope breaks, and Tom drifts off. When Philippe discovers this he sets out to find Tom, and he and Marge bring the sunburned Tom aboard again. When Marge blames Philippe for treating his friend in this way he says that in fact he and Tom never spent their childhood together. When Philippe looks for a shirt among Tom's things he discovers some of his own bank statements hidden, though he keeps his discovery from Marge. Marge asks Tom to leave them behind and go home when they reach land. One night, we see Tom hide the earrings he stole earlier in the pocket of some of Philippe's clothes. The next day the two men have a conversation about the bank statements, and Philippe guesses that it might have been Tom's intention to pretend to be Philippe and claim his money as his own. Philippe and Marge have a row involving the earrings Marge has found among Philippe's clothes, and when Philippe tosses her Fra Angelico writings into the ocean she demands to be set ashore. Philippe and Tom continue alone. They continue their conversation about the bank statements, and Tom details how he would have killed Philippe to claim his money, and admits that he planted the jewelry. Philippe is repulsed and fascinated by Tom's behaviour. The two men play a hand of poker; Philippe wagers money, Tom the pocket watch Philippe's father gave him. When Tom discovers that Philippe tries to cheat in order to lose, Tom is upset. He says a few thousand dollars is no longer enough when he might have it all. He decides the game in Philippe's favour and stabs him in the chest as Philippe screams, \"Marge\". Tom Ripley must struggle with the boat against the wind, but he covers Philippe's body in a sack, then ties it to the anchor and dumps it. He accidentally falls in himself, but struggles back onto the boat and steers the boat to harbour in Mongibello. He goes to visit Marge, claiming that Philippe does not want to see her again. He collects some of Philippe's items from the house and from the boat. Claiming to be Mr. Greenleaf he goes to a boating agency to sell the boat, then leaves for Rome. There he buys equipment to fake a passport and learns how to convincingly fake Philippe's signature. He speaks to Marge on the phone, successfully convincing her that she is speaking to Philippe. He types Marge a letter and brings it personally to Marge. She takes him with her to Naples to show him the city. While she writes a letter to Philippe at a cafe, he takes a walk and looks at the market stalls. Back at Tom's hotel in Rome, he must escape notice from Madame Popova ( Elvire Popesco), who knows Philippe from Mongibello; he soon gets an apartment for himself. Philippe's friend Freddy comes to visit after learning about the address and is suspicious when he finds Tom there wearing Philippe's clothes. Tom comes to see Freddy as a threat to his secret and gives him a fatal blow with an antique statuette. At night when the building is quiet he carries the body down the stairs and into the street where his car is waiting to help him dump the body. Soon after he is about to leave the apartment behind when the police come by; he narrowly escapes in a taxi. He goes straight to the bank to withdraw a large sum from Philippe's account, then telephones the apartment identifying himself to the police as Tom Ripley and desiring to speak to Philippe. A police officer, Riccordi ( Erno Crisa), comes to Tom's pension to question him about the murder in which Mr. Greenleaf is a suspect, but Tom is, of course, unable to help. The next day Tom is present at the morgue to identify Freddy's body, along with Marge and others. They go to a restaurant and discuss Philippe's whereabouts, though they all believe him to be innocent. While at the table, Tom almost slips up when he quotes one of the letters Marge has written to Philippe, but he comes up with a lie and says that he met with Philippe the day before, and that Philippe is now in Mongibello. As soon as he can Tom travels to Mongibello to make it appear as if Philippe has been there and left a suicide note, the money Tom withdrew and a will leaving all the money to Marge. He leaves the house through a window just as Marge enters with the police. Back in Rome the next morning, Riccordi comes to Tom's pension room to ask him questions and reveal certain suspicions, but without result. Next, Tom is back in Mongibello, coinciding with a religious festival. He knocks on Marge's door, but there is no answer, and when he visits Mr. O'Brien and Madame Popova they tell him they have not seen her for weeks. The next morning Tom finds a way into the house and finds Marge still in mourning over Philippe's death. He tries to convince her that Philippe did not truly love her. He announces that he will return to America and kisses her goodbye, but she stops him and asks him to stay. He has her play the guitar for him, and we see the two in bed together. One day soon after, Tom and Marge go swimming. Philippe's father comes to town to meet Marge and sell Philippe's boat. Tom stays by the beach while Marge goes to meet him. When they investigate the boat, they discover that from a rope tangled in the engine hangs the rotten corpse of Philippe Greenleaf. The police come to the beachside cafe and have the waitress call Tom Ripley to the telephone. As Tom goes to take the call, he smiles to himself.",

         "I saw Minghella's \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" and Clement's \"Purple Noon\" back to back. Two entirely different movies based on exactly the same book. The differences are personal of course. Minghella has a moralistic view of his characters and their darkness must be, somehow, explained if not justified. Clement's allows the amorality of his characters to run loose. Minghella casts Matt Damon as Tom Ripley, a rather invisible actor in every way and although he's pretty good here, he's not good enough to overshadow his rival: Jude Law. Clement casts Alain Delon as Ripley and you will be with him all the way, you'll go where he goes you will turn out to be as amoral as he is - at least I did, I just wanted him to get away with it and why? Because he was Alain Delon, the Tom Ripley that, clearly, Patricia Highsmith intended. His rival is Maurice Ronet, good as he is, I didn't miss him when he left. You know why? Because I was left with the dangerous, magnetic, amoral, riveting Alain Delon. Clement allows us to see the difficulty and danger of the murders, we see them, we are there. Minghella plays it rather hurriedly. There is no real tension or horror. The most suspenseful moment is at an Opera house. The pluses on \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" - besides the aforementioned Jude Law - are Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett in two beautifully written and performed parts. In \"Purple Noon\" Marie Laforet is left rather to her own devices. Once all said and done you can watch both films as if they weren't even related. I prefer \"Purple Noon\" but that's just me.",
         "Extremely well done, tightly edited, well acted (by everyone, including the small roles, especially the actor who has to appear dead with long camera shots in a tense scene in the hotel). Delon is perfectly cast, with his calculating cool. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes on the yacht---nothing gimmicky, but shot with an expertise that gives true drama to the action. You can feel the waves, the wind, and the sun. The colors are vibrant on the DVD. Though a scene like this in a typical movie today would include a heavy ominous score, the director simply lets the sound of the wind create the tension. The score (by Nina Rota), in fact, is understated, unlike anything today. Even the opening credits have style.",
         "I'm fascinated by a scene at a restaurant. We get an extreme close-up of a woman who is kept out of focus while another character in the background, who is speaking and is in the center of the shot, remains in focus. Is the woman who is out of focus important or not? More to the point, was shooting it this way a good idea? It illustrates by contrast how sure-footed René Clément is most of the time. Usually there can be no debate. I wasn't familiar with Clément's work until this film, but my God, he's good. His camera is always in some unexpected place that enhances the drama and tightens the suspense. He shares that talent with Orson Welles (meaning the Welles of \"Citizen Kane\" and \"The Magnificent Ambersons,\" not, say, \"Lady from Shanghai\"), who also made decisions that are surprising yet invariably right. Tom Ripley (Alain Delon) and Phillipe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) are lately inseparable friends. They're both idling in Europe, but on papa Greenleaf's dime. Phillipe's fiancée Marge (Marie Laforêt) feels sorry for Tom but resents his presence. Phillipe's other friend, Freddie (Billy Kearns), considers Tom Ripley a worthless moocher. But there's more to Tom Ripley, the mimic, the forger, the talented criminal improviser, than anyone, even Tom Ripley himself, can guess. Alain Delon, with his chiseled looks and cold beauty, makes an excellent Tom Ripley. The script is brilliantly adapted from Patricia Highsmith's terrific suspense novel, \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\": the dialogue is always bringing the themes of duplicity, love, self-love, the nature of identity, ruthlessness and murder to the surface where they are given a brilliant sheen by Clément and his cinematographer Henri Decaë. We're left to figure things out for ourselves, which is rare. Do we need to be told what Tom thinks of when he sees all those dead fish? When a door with a mirror swings open toward Tom, do we need to see Tom's mirror image to understand the mirror's significance? Or is it enough that we know there's a mirror next to Tom? I know what the answers would have been in Hollywood\u0097in 1960 and now. Here, the answers are no, no and yes.",
         "Up until he starred in this movie, Alain Delon was considered a light romantic lead--not surprising at all since his breathtaking good looks would naturally lend itself to that sort of matinee idol typecasting. It was only when director Rene Clement tapped into the dangerous undercurrent held in reserve behind the placid, beautiful surface that Delon's wholly unique, dark, sociopathic persona would emerge--the persona which would put him on the map and he would forever be identified with. In \"Plein Soleil\" AKA \"Purple Noon,\" Delon exudes all the stealth and sleekness of a panther--dark-haired, riveting gaze, smoldering, seductive and sinister. And like a panther, he proves himself to be just as lethal. Delon stars as Tom Ripley, a pretty-but-poor young man who takes off to Rome as an errand boy to fetch the wayward Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet), and bring him back home to San Francisco to his impatient, rich father in exchange for $5000. Not surprisingly, the spoiled, unsupervised Philippe doesn't want to return and give up his profligate, libertine lifestyle, and neither does Tom, when he gets a taste of how the other half lives. And he soon determines he doesn't have to, when he concocts to take over Phillippe's money, his beautiful girlfriend Marge Duval (Marie Laforet), his identity. But of course, even in a perfect scheme devised by a cunning mind, one can't plan for everything and things eventually go south for our man Ripley. I haven't read the Patricia Highsmith book on which this is based, but I've seen the other film version of it, \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" so I have only that to compare it with. First the titles: The latter one gets right to the point and is intriguing for that; the original has a certain romantic appeal, but is sinister behind the pretty sound of it--it portends of dark (purple) clouds (of evil) converging upon a bright sunlit horizon. The latter film has outward homoerotic aspects that is very latent in this version (so much so that those expecting it to be overt will probably not notice--but it had to be given the era in which the movie was released), but it's there all right. Tom is ostensibly supposed to covet Marge, but even when she's in a scene with him and Phillippe, the tension and electricity fairly crackles between the two intense young men, but not with her. Another difference, and I understand the latter version to be faithful to the book in this way, is Marge is not affluent, which rather puts her more in Tom's position as she is also at the mercy of Phillippe's money and volatile moods, and that lends another aspect to the film. These differences I found negligible and didn't take away anything for either movie to me. However, I must say I found Delon's Ripley far more appealing than Matt Damon's one. Not taking anything away from Mr. Damon as he is a capable actor and an attractive man, but he simply is not in Delon's league, either in the looks or magnetism department. Damon really downplayed his pleasant looks for the role, and I really think that was a minus--he not only looks, but acts so unsettling that even a new born babe wouldn't take candy from this man. Delon, on the other hand, is a much more refreshing villian and, strangely enough, more believable. Refreshing because he's such a change from the usual villians that you would peg right from looking at them they're a heavy--they look unsavory (or at the very least not attractive). Believable because despite whatever sinister intentions Delon's Tom might emit, he's outwardly likeable and what's more, is so devastatingly handsome that it's easy to see how people would not take their instincts about such a person seriously and would let their guard down. Ronet is fine in his portrayal as the not-so-nice rich boy Phillippe, but Laforet as Marie--to me she came across like an afterthought, she's bland and forgettable, but that's ok because the dynamics are between the two men, and later with how Tom handles his predicament. This being said, I didn't care much for the pat crime-doesn't-pay finale in this one and thought the latter version far more satisfying in that respect. Both are excellent movies in their own respective ways, I don't know if anyone can really say one vastly outdoes the other, but see this one if you want to see Delon unleashed. P.S. Look for Romy Schneider, Delon's fiancee at the time, in the beginning of the movie as one of Phillippe's companions. The beautiful, Austrian-born Ms. Schneider followed Delon back to France after she fell in love with him during the making of \"Christine.\"",
         "I found this film more interesting than the recent Minghella opus because the people were more disturbing. Alain Delon is too good-looking to be dismissed as the geeky wannabee Matt Damon plays. His insanity in a pretty package is as unsettling as Gene Tierney's in \"Leave Her to Heaven.\" Delon looks like Maurice Ronet's brother, and you can see him wonder why if he's just as handsome as the other guy, why doesn't he have as much money? Ronet is more unpredictable than Jude Law as the whimsical rich boy and his death is every bit as shocking. I can't imagine that Anthony Minghella hadn't seen this version before making his own. He probably regrets Scorsese's reconstruction of Rene Clement's film so we can all make the comparison. Some scenes play like a shot-for-shot remake. Billy Kearns's brutal Freddy Miles is an obvious template for Philip Seymour Hoffman's more calculated and less powerful performance, and Gwyneth Paltrow's final breakdown is VERY close to that of Marie Laforet's. All through the 1999 film, I kept wondering why everybody couldn't see what was wrong with the toad-like Damon. In this one, Delon's plausible, even glamorous exterior made the success of his deceptions more understandable, and more frightening.",
         "Visually, this film could serve as a cinematic poster for a Mediterranean cruise. Cinematographer Henri Decae draws us into the film with its alluring Italian locales and gorgeous panoramic vistas. Bright, complementary hues and high color contrast translate into eye-popping reds and yellows. And, of course, there's the deep blue color of the sea, and a brilliant sunlit sky. Such is the setting for a story wherein three attractive, young adults (Tom, Philippe, and Marge) test a 3-way relationship that is far more complex than it first appears. Indeed, trouble lurks beneath the surface (so to speak), in this \"Italiano paradiso\" thriller. In the first forty minutes, the psychological motivations of our three beautiful people are unclear and subject to change. It's hard to tell who is doing what to whom. Subsequent to this narrative setup, we see exactly where the story is headed. Because \"Plein Soleil\" is a psychodrama, casting is important. The three leads (Alain Delon, Maurice Ronet, and Marie Laforet) are all convincing in their roles. I have not read the Highsmith novel on which the screenplay was based. So I cannot make an intertextual analysis. I do think this 1960 film is superior, for various reasons, to the more recent remake. Adroitly directed by Rene Clement, with a buoyant musical score by Nino Rota, \"Plein Soleil\" is a character study of an amoral pleasure seeker whose charming personality masks the evil within. The juxtaposition of inwardly criminal intent with outwardly idyllic scenes of Italy and the Mediterranean results is an art house film that is both picturesque and suspenseful. It's a film that appeals both to our eyes and to our brains.",
         "This is one of those movies that will persist in your memory. Head and shoulders above recent remake - \"Talented Mr. Ripley\". The beautiful photography and horrifying crimes will fascinate and disturb. Alain Delon is delightfully deceitful (as Ripley). Marie Laforet (Marge) is stunningly beautiful. A must see for film noir fans.",
         "Alain Delon and Maurice Ronnet play a fascinating duet of savage cruelty in this tense beautifully crafted Rene Clement thriller from Patricia Highsmith's pen. Anthony Minghella remade it as \"The Talented Mr Ripley\" with a more polished script and some startling character development but \"Purple Noon\" has an unbeatable extra gear in Alain Delon's portrayal. He is deadly because anyone would have fallen into his trap. His beauty is inviting and reassuring. We witness his brutal side but don't get to the point of judging him. That is more unique than rare in a movie. Delon's Ripley acts as if there was nothing objectionable about his behavior. A poster boy for amorality. Marie Laforet's Marge is stunningly beautiful but don't get to know her as well as we do Gyneth Paltrow in Minghella's version. If you liked The Talented Mr Ripley\" you're going to love \"Purple Noon\" and vice-versa.",
         "Two stars of the French cinematography, Alain Delon and Maurice Ronet, combined their efforts in this excellent film, which showed good views of Rome and Italy in its first half. The second part becomes the decisive one when Ripley (Delon)jealous of the wealthy position of Philippe Greenleaf (Ronet) decides to kill him in a yacht. Ripley intelligently was able to behave and sign bank checks as if he was Greenleaf. Even he conquered the love of Greenleaf's girl friend, but the end surprised him and everyone watching the film. This type of films should be among the 250 best of the last century, but for unknown reasons it is not included.",
         "I watched \"The Purple Noon\" with the Turkish title \"Kizgin Günes\" which means \"The Scorching Sun\" at cinema Elhamra in Izmir when I was 12 or so. (My birth date is 1950.) It was the first time when I saw the name and the image of Alain Delon on a movie poster. On the poster Delon was seen naked on the upper part of his body, directing a yacht's steering wheel. Years later I would read Highsmith's \"Talented Mr. Ripley\" and realize that, the screenplay of the movie had some fortunate differences from the book. One of these differences was the interesting dialog between Delon and Ronet on the latter's yacht just before the murder. This dialog which is written by the director Rene Clement (or his co-writer Paul Gogeoff), is, in my opinion, one of the finest, in all film history. Delon, tells Ronet, as a joke, about his plan to kill him and adopt his identity. Ronet enjoys the joke and criticizes the plan on its weak points. Delon logically answers all the criticisms Ronet has made. Ronet gradually realizes that the plan is too thoughtfully conceived and too minutely prepared. He begins to suspect that it may not be a joke. He gets nervous and then frightened, but only too late. Delon, suddenly initiating to materialize the plan, gets up and stabs Ronet with a knife. Ronet dies with a shock in his eyes. Delon throws away Ronet's body off the yacht into the sea. But he is unaware that he has failed to get rid of Ronet's body. At the final episode of the movie when the yacht is laid on the stocks, policemen(differently again from the book) find Ronet's moss covered body entangled with the propellers. In the film, Delon is caught by law whereas in the book, Ripley is not. After 40 years, all I remember of the film are the things which are absent (maybe missed) in the book. I also like the Highsmith's book and don't like the idea of changing books text just for the fancies of directors of cinema or stage. But Clement's (and Gogeoff's) script, I think, was full of creativity. I like Minghella's recent version of \"Talented Mr. Ripley\" much less than the Highsmith's book and Clement's film version of it. Minghella, seems to me, among many other things, especially missed Delon and the Fifties and the subtleties of Clement's script. After seeing the film and the fascinating personality of Delon as an actor, I had resolved that I would see any Delon film I would come across thereafter and did so. COSKUN BUKTEL"

Philippe toys with Tom, pretending he will go back home, but has no intentions of leaving his bride to be, Marge, and honoring his father's wishes. After some time passes, Mr. Greenleaf considers the mission a failure and cuts Tom off. Tom, in desperation, kills Philippe, assumes his identity, and lives the life of a rich playboy. However, he will need all his conman abilities to keep Philippe's friends and the police off the trail.",
         "Tom Ripley and Philippe Greenleaf are lately inseparable friends. They're both idling in Europe, but on papa Greenleaf's dime. Philippe's fiancée Marge feels sorry for Tom but resents his presence, while Philippe's other friend, Freddie, considers Tom Ripley a worthless moocher. But there's more to Tom Ripley, the mimic, the forger, the talented criminal improviser, than anyone, even Tom Ripley himself, can guess.",
         "With no money of his own, Tom Ripley lives comfortably enough off the kindness of his wealthy companions. For a fee of $5,000, he is hired by the father of his childhood friend, Philippe Greenleaf, to retrieve Philippe from Rome and bring him back to San Francisco. Upon Tom's arrival in Rome, Philippe knows Tom's task, and while keeping Tom as a companion, strings him along, as Philippe has no intention of going with Tom back to the US. Philippe treats Tom poorly as he knows Tom will endure the abuse to get the money. But as Tom, Philippe and Philippe's girlfriend Marge Duval sail from Rome to Taormina aboard Philippe's sailboat for a short vacation, Philippe knows that Tom is not all he appears on the surface. Conversely, Tom, using two of his innate skills, has other plans to make money, far more than the $5,000 fee. Beyond the primary act of his plan, Tom is required not only to outwit the authorities, but also to manipulate those that know both Philippe and him, who include Marge, their American acquaintance Freddy Miles, and another acquaintance named O'Brien.",
