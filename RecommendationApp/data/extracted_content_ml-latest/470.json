         "I don't really care how bad people assume this film is, to me it is somewhat of a classic. Bernie Mac steals the show from his opening scene as the dubious uncle Vester. Always about ten seconds away from losing his temper and revealing his true psychopathic side. This alone brings me and a fair few others close to tears. Add to this Showboat and the cast of ex-con catering and defy virtually anyone not to need picking up from the floor. Hysterics are guaranteed. Not big, not clever and certainly not in any top 100 lists, but a film that gets better each time I see it.",
         "Similar to such trilogies as American Pie and Home Alone, the first House Party was indisputably the best. The second House Party wasn't quite the same but decent still. And then there's the third. After waiting YEARS to watch this film, having seen the first two, I felt cheated and utterly disgusted. It's nothing more than a long music video slash band promotion vehicle, disguised as a sequel with a heavily diluted plot. There were very few funny moments compared to the previous films and Immature, as well as Uncle Vester and the aunt, destroyed the whole film. There are a whole load of other issues I have with the film, but I don't want to give anything away. Do yourself a favour; don't watch it! And knowing this film is tripe, don't watch House Party 4 either!",
         "a lot of people thought this movie wasn't good and wasn't funny. they're definitely wrong. this movie was hilarious! obviously the first house party was the best and frankly it was the 2nd one that just flat out sucked and wasn't that funny, but house party 3 had so many great scenes, moments, characters, and lines. from uncle vester to reynaldo rey, the crazy old lady, ex con catering, showboat and the hungry guy at the end of the party, there were a lot of very funny scenes. gotta love the dinner scene, anything bernie mac, the blind rappers, and ex con catering company. kid's jokes are kinda lame but the rest of the cast makes up for it. i'd definitely recommend this! a 9 out of 10!",
         "House Party 3 to me was a disapointment. The jokes, just weren't there. The only character that is really funny is Uncle Vester. Shame as the first two films were great. My advice is just stay with the first film.",
         "I remember hearing about this movie when i was twelve and in sixth grade and it seemed kinda funny but forgot about it until I saw the trailer on the Jason Goes To Hell tape from my video store.It seemed to be very funny and so I started to remember all three and rented them.Boy am I glad I saw them now.I might buy them after the next renting time.I laughed throughout the whole flick.The first one was funny as hell,the second one was just as funny and this one was a real comedy classic,of course the whole trilogy was stupendous.I especially loved the scene were they are all eating dinner at Veda's parents house and Bernie Mac recognizes her mom and talks about her like she was the town whore when they were younger.Immature did an okay performance in this one but were horrible in House Party 4.it was great to see Chris Tucker before his Rush Hour Fame.I sure wish Robin Harris hadn't died after the first one got released,I would have loved to see him in this one as I did in House Party.I give this flick an A+.",
         "House Party 3 is a great finish to the franchise started by Kid N Play. The duo has grown this time out and the film features many cameos by comedians AJ Johnson, Chris Tucker and Joe Torry. Berine Mac steals every scene he's in as does David Edwards.",
         "This movie was a real let down. House Party #1 and #2 were so funny and entertaining. And why isn't Martin Lawrence in this one? The only characters that returned from the first two House Party movies are Kid, Play and Cindy. Also, this film doesn't pick up where the second movie left off. It doesn't show how Kid and Cindy break up, or where Kid meets his new girl friend. It doesn't even tell you where Play's new car came from! This movie didn't have the magic that made the first two films so great. I didn't like this film at all. It was lousy, boring and a big disappointment. It didn't even seem like one of the House Parties. I give this movie an extremely rare 1 out of 10. I've only seen it once and I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me.",
         "Rated R for Language and Some Sexuality/Nudity I have not seen House Party 4.It doesn't even feature Kid N Play so its probably the worst one but out of the ones with Kid N Play, yes this is the worst House Party.Its not bad at all, its just not as good as House Party 1 which was very funny and entertaining and House Party 2 which was very good and had more drama.There are some very funny parts in the film and it is overall a pretty good movie but its just not as good as the other two.This one has Kid getting married, while him and his friend and partner Play try to find a rap group to manage.There are early appearances from actors Bernie Mac and Chris Tucker.Overall House Party 3 is a funny enough movie but the worst in the trilogy.Should not be in the bottom 100!",
         "If you were to ask me how many ways this film transformed into a disaster, I do not believe I would have enough fingers and toes to fully count the ways. From the dreamy beginning of this bland final chapter, until the ending clichÃ© moments, there were probably a million different themes and elements that were utterly pathetic. In fact, I believe that this may be the first film that I have watched which had no redeeming values surrounding it. For any of you that have watched, like myself, the House Party trilogy, there is a level of expectation that follows these films. The first movie set the groundwork. Kid & Play need to get to a party and express themselves lyrically. The sequel finished the shabby generic walls of the house by repeating a similar diagram, while the third film was the demolition team to tear it down. Everything set up from the beginning of this series was destroyed, demolished, decayed, disemboweled by the time that the third installment arrived. We were missing key characters, Kid & Play seemed less excited by this film, and apparently continuity from the second film was not a top priority for director Eric Meza. This film is nothing but trash left in the house for too long. House Party 3 smells, it is attracting too many flies, and mold is the only form of life willing to adapt to it. Sad to see the potentials of a trilogy die because the final film didn't pay respect to its beginnings. I would like to say that the acting was to blame for such a disappointing ending, but that means I would have to admit to there actually being acting in this film. That is something I am not willing to acknowledge at this time. As our story developed, you could easily see the relief behind Kid & Play's eyes knowing that this was going to be their final jaunt in the House Party line. In fact, you could see the excitement melt away from their characters as the film progressed. It was a headache to watch. Kid was not his typical expression-esquire self, but instead, older and more tired? Play was just annoying in this film. Meza decided to completely disregard their passions in the first two films and make them managers instead of performers in this final one. This is what hurt the most, to witness two characters that we have seen grow over time from young idealistic teens ready to lyrically express themselves and go to parties, to old, tired, and boring actors caring less about the music, more about the money, and have the lamest parties imaginable. I thought I would never find myself saying this, but I missed \"Pops\" from the original. I didn't miss him in the second film, but now seeing this final chapter I missed some of the old faces. This may be the only time you hear me say this, but I missed Martin Lawrence. While I hated his character in the first two films, he was an element missing House Party 3. They tried to cover this by employing Bernie Mac as the annoying Uncle, but it just didn't seem to work. Screaming is not a substitute for acting. Chris Tucker makes a small cameo, and honestly, I could have used more of him. He was a shining bit of light in this dark, damp, disgusting film. As you read this review, you may find yourself saying, \"Andy, you hated the other two films, what made you think this would be any different?\" I don't think I was hoping for Oscar nominations, but I did want a strong finale to this trilogy. I worked my way through it, I felt I deserved it. I wanted to see familiar faces, as much as I hated them, I wanted to see a familiar plot (however generic and repetitive it was to be), and I wanted to see a union between two familiar characters, instead of throwing in a random stranger at the end. I feel as if these are very reasonable requests considering nothing lead me to believe this film would end up to be the tragedy it was. After watching this film, no matter how bad it was going to be, I wanted to be able to flip through the channels on TV and see House Party on TBS and find myself reminiscing of the future that I knew. Now, that is never going to happen. If there is one trilogy that I want to put behind me, it is the House Party films. For nearly an hour and a half, we watch unmotivated characters force themselves through clichÃ© urban hip-hop cinema motions. Where were the bad guys? Where were the familiarities of the original films? I hated the first films, but I detested House Party 3. Why bother building a fan base if you are just going to tear it down with the finale. It is somewhat like changing characters midway through a television series. It just doesn't work, and it didn't work in this film. Overall, this movie was a disaster. While the other two films were never much to write home about, I did want a conclusion. I wanted to finish this series without worrying that there may be more coming around the bend. That was, before I noticed House Party 4 as another sequel. This series should have ended after the first one. House Party is a classic example of what happens when Hollywood notices that small budget films can continue to make money even after they loose their appeal. Take a look at Scary Movie 4 being released soon. Honestly, is it necessary? I do not suggest this film or this entire series. The first one, if you are forced to watch, than watch. Otherwise, don't waste your brain space! Grade: * out of *****",
         "Now after the sorta disappointing HOUSE PARTY 2: THE PAJAMA JAM, I had mixed feelings the new one. Only to find out my worries has been blown to beats, because director Eric Menza has turned the HOUSE PARTY series to a new leaf. And actually made a movie that is better than the first one. Kid is getting married to a new love named Veda(Angela Means) and Play is the one having seconds thoughts about the wedding. So in good favor he decides to throw the last party of parties....A Bachelor Party. But Showboat(Michael Colyar) wants rap group Sex As a Weapon(TLC) signed way before the wedding. Kid's nephews(Immature) and Uncle Vester(Bernie Mac) come into the mix to save or destroy the day. It's about time are Kid has grown up and it shows for both of them. The dance scenes are not here or miss, but the music is banging hard and rough. And this is way more funnier than 1 & 2 and has the funniest dinner table scene I've seen in my life. Outbeating the Klumps 10 to 1. And Bernie Mac's scene stealing performance has the same energy as the late Robin Harris had one the first one, but more edgier & kinetic. Fun from stat to finish. Better than the first one and all in the series."
