         "content": "This is a movie that we got a very long time ago when we still purchased a paper TV-magazine to know what was on TV every night. The last couple of years when we did that we frequently got a DVD as a \u201cbonus\u201d with it and this is one of those. According to my movie collection database we have had it since 2008 and last evening we finally got around watching it.\r\n\r\nThis is a quite okay movie. It will not blow your socks off but it is fairly okay and worth watching. It is a nice thriller/fugitive style movie to watch on a middle-of-the-week evening. I would probably not have been impressed had I gone to a theater to watch it but watching it as a TV-movie it was quite enjoyable. There are the usual silly moments that tend to be in these kinds of movies of course, starting with the stupid wife who just has to pick up the bloody knife just before the police arrives. Why do all (most) script writers have to put that crap into every movie?\r\n\r\nI do generally like Tommy Lee Jones even though he tends to look and act pretty much the same no matter which movie he is in. I guess I like stability. The plot is okay. It is a fairly conventional husband frames wife, wife goes after husband kind of story and does not really provide any surprises.\r\n\r\nOne thing that caught my attention was that the car dealer apparently could do a credit check on a woman that was, as was found out later in the movie, dead since three years. I think someone missed the QA-checking of the script in terms of credibility there but then, as I said, the movie will not blow your socks of and the plot is fairly standard Hollywood fare with the usual silly stuff in it.",

         "With two really good lead actors and people I like to watch (Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd) plus an on-the-run-\"Fugitive\"-type story, I expected a lot. I wasn't disappointed, either, although it's a bit hokey. This is a very intense, involving story, a la the above-mentioned \"The Fugitive,\" except this time it's a woman chasing down her ex-husband who set her up for murder. Once again, we see Jones in his familiar role of chasing down the supposed-criminal. As interesting as the story is, there are some credibility gaps such as why Jones didn't have a picture of the ex-husband in the first place or the always-annoying hesitation-before-shooting at the end which saves the \"good guy\"...and a few other things like that which are unrealistic. Will Hollywood ever stop that nonsense? However, clich√©s aside, overall it's very entertaining and always fun to watch no matter how many times I see it. Both Judd and Jones are excellent in these kind of roles.",
         "When you are convicted for something like killing your husband you can not be convicted a second time for the same crime. Sounds logical, since you can't kill someone twice. But when your dead husband suddenly shows up and you want your revenge, you can get that since you've already had the punishment. These are the circumstances Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) finds herself in after she is released from prison, six years after her conviction. How and why the husband (Bruce Greenwood) framed her is not really important, he just did. Now Libby tries to track him down with Matty, their son, as her main reason. The problem is Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), her parole officer who is strict in his rules. He does not believe her, but of course we understand this will slowly change. 'Double Jeopardy' belongs to the group of thrillers where you expect certain things to happen and you will see you were right. That is not a bad thing, but it means the road to those predictable moments must have something to offer. This film has some things, one of them is Ashley Judd. Maybe it was because I always like Ashley Judd, but for me she was the reason this film entertained me. She plays the clever Libby in way that keeps her serious but sometimes quite funny as well. Especially the sarcastic little remarks made me smile more than once. Tommy Lee Jones is reliable as always, especially in 'The Fugitive' kind of roles like this one is. Scenes between him and Judd are entertaining on themselves. Greenwood turns out to be a nice villain. Simply said: if you do not expect too much of 'Double Jeopardy' there is a good chance you will have a really good time.",
         "I've read all the bad reviews-I can say that it's really not THAT bad-granted-this picture has no realism whatsoever but-I could rattle off the names of many movies even more unbelievable that are still considered good films. Not that this is a really GOOD film or anything-but it does what it does well-which is to get your attention and hold it-no great analysis, no deep conversations afterward about \"what it all meant\". Just a bit of time away from day to day life. The movie is also trying to appeal to a particular crowd, the type who like these type of \"mind thrillers'(Guilty as sin is another one, Malice, Final analysis etc etc) There's a whole host of movies like this one. Now this particular movie stars Ashley Judd who is so talented she almost had me thinking she really was locked up-definitely a quality actress-and if your a female and have just had a really BAD breakup you may wanna see it for that \"woman will triumph\" quality. Not that I'm saying this movie is great but I always tend to look for the bad AND the good-I thought one of the worst thrillers(a lot worse then this) was malice with Kidman and Alec Baldwin-that one was not only improbable but also extremely boring-but I'm getting off the subject at hand... I liked this. saw it in the theater and rooted for Ashley all the way. Seen a lot worse in my time. And lastly if you wanna check out ridiculous movies(and it's a SEQUEL to boot) rent \"revenge of the stepford wives\".",
         "If you listen to the critics who knows where we would be. I ignored the comments that this was another Fugitive only a female version, but found the movie fast paced and well acted by Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd, as well as the whole cast. I liked the story line and it was exciting and the time just flew by. Go see it you will enjoy it!!!!",
         "... but enough about Ashley Judd. Standard Tommy Lee Jones fare here, a thriller in which he is the cop/law enforcement officer of some sort (in this case a parole officer) with a dark past who saves the day. Some good action, not bad stunt scene on a ferry, and the ever lovely Ashley Judd, particularly fantastic in her working out scenes that were there for nothing but gratuitous titillation, and who can complain about that?",
         "Ashley Judd is very beautiful and apt for this role. The way she characterizes a wife,a mother and an victim is too good. Hats off to Ashley Judd. After Elizabeth Taylor ,I like the acting skill of this fine women. Ppl - watch this movie.Its a nice dose of suspense,romance and dose of other emotions as well and Ashley Judd did her best. The story is subtle. Good screen play. Good direction. All in all good investment of time. Watch it for Ashley.They say that this movie has some issue in the legal interpretation of some legal point but I think that it has no relevance to the movie in so far as the way the screen play is done.I believe that the movie doesn't weigh on that interpretation alone as the climax just sinks into us without that gravity. I personally think though the story is good,Ashley carried it excellently well and an extremely delicate one at that. Infinite thanks to this beauty of an actor and a person. Thanks all.",
         "Nick Parsons, played by Bruce Greenwood, wants to protect his ill gotten wealth; so he fakes his own demise. His wife, Libby, played by Ashley Judd, is convicted of murder. While in prison, Libby finds out that her husband is still alive and has taken her son to New Orleans and is living under an assumed name. Upon release, Mrs. Parsons breaks parole in order to get her son back. One other thing, she realizes she can kill her husband for real and not suffer the consequences. Tommy Lee Jones plays the parole officer trying to bring her back to custody. He ends up helping Libby. Miss Judd is very beautiful and is probably on screen 97% of the movie. No objection here. Jones was outstanding. This action thriller is worth seeing more than once.",
         "I saw this movie in the theater and really enjoyed it. Ashley Judd does a great job as a woman convicted of killing her husband and realizing later that he's still alive. The title, of course, comes from the fact that since she's already been convicted of killing him once, if she finds him and kills him for real, she can't be tried again. Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as her parole officer, and Bruce Greenwood is the dead husband who's not so dead. Although this movie was very entertaining and well acted, it was extremely derivative. Also, several elements of the plot in the first scene were somehow telegraphed - or else it all seemed familiar. Still, this is a good rental and a fun watch.",
         "This movie by Australian director is now a weekly DVD but definitely worth seeing. Ashley Judd plays Elizabeth \"Libby\" Parsons who loses her husband, Nick, during a Yachting trip with him. During the police investigation it is discovered that Nick was in a financial crisis at the time of his death but left a two million dollar life insurance policy collect. Suddenly a whole set of evidence is produced to reinforce the allegation that she had a motive to murder her husband and she is convicted of murder. There is a plot problem that in reality she would have to wait seven years if he went missing from a boat before the claim was paid and it would be unlikely she would be convicted of murder without corroborating witness testimony from an independent party. Nonetheless somehow she is convicted of her husbands murder and it provides the intrigue. In prison Libby studies law in order to prove her innocence and when she phones her friend Matty who has custody of her 4 year son she accidentally stumbles on the fact that her husband may still be alive. The insurance claim has been paid to her son and her friend can use the money in his care apparently. Libby also learns that once convicted of murder of someone that you cannot be sent to trial again over the same murder and its called \"Double Jeopardy\" in legal terms. Libby is determined to hunt down her Husband for what he has done when she is released. Libby is released into supervised sentence under parole officer Travis Lehman ( Tommy Lee Jones) but escapes custody and sets out to track down her husband to prove her innocence. There is lots of action and Ashley Judd is such a great actress that you become emotional attached to her battle through the film. Tommy Lee Jones also performs well in his role as he breaks ranks to assist Ashley in quest to be reunited with her son in freedom.",
         "Great plot - excellent acting - beautiful sights and scenes. Exciting story with lots of action. Thoroughly enjoyable - even if one knows the plot in advance. Many touching moments. Strongly recommend this movie which has something for everyone."
