He is her polar opposite: he chases women, smokes cigars, and has just published his first novel. During their pursuit of the story, Peter and Sabrina clash over virtually everything - he also subjects Sabrina to indecent exposure in front of a group of boy scouts after he catches her skinny dipping.",

         "Combine THE THIN MAN with IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT and THE FRONT PAGE and what do you get? This is an enjoyable thriller - rival newspaper reporters (Nolte playing Jack Nicholson and Roberts playing herself) try to outscoop each other, get drawn into a suspicious cover-up and wind up joining forces (and falling in love) as they single-handedly solve the mystery. Terrible title but some beautiful cinematography and a plot that moves along entertainingly. It's all predictable, but the fun lies in the constant attempts of the two protagonists to outsmart, outscoop and blatantly lie to each other to get the upper hand. Marsha Mason has two scenes playing a Senator (one without dialogue) in a performance that lasts less than a minute, which would tend to indicate her subplot was cut in the editing room. It's long enough at 123 minutes. If you like the stars and want to see a well-done romantic cops and robbers flick, this is a go.",
         "Handsomely-produced 1940s throwback has two modern-day reporters for rival Chicago newspapers both covering a train-wreck, eventually teaming up to get all the shady details. Casting Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte in the leads might've been a gamble that paid off, but the ruff-n-bitchy chemistry they try to create doesn't click, mainly because the lines in the script are so stale. The picture looks expensive, and the plot isn't a con (I suppose it is fully thought out), but who even wants to see Julia Roberts in a Tracy-Hepburn knock-off like this? And who wants to see her kissing Nick Nolte? The whole concept is, well, Troubled. *1/2 from ****",
         "That this film fails on so many levels and still remains watchable, if not actually enjoyable, must be a credit to someone involved in the production; it's just not immediately clear who. There are three main problems with the movie. One, the attempt to graft the noirish elements onto a hi-tech industrial-intrigue plot, which results in an uncomfortable mix of pulp culture from two generations: the hardboiled detectives of the '40s thrust into the realm of today's potboiler mystery bestsellers. Whereas the earlier style was streamlined, and relatively simple and focused, today's genre authors seemingly compete for who can make the most convoluted plot with sidetracks, red herrings and subplots galore. This contrast leaves the film trying to go in two directions at once. Two, the relationship between the leads is never quite satisfactory. Roberts and Nolte are just not cut out for their cut-out roles, and while they try gamely, it's tough to buy them as reporters who bicker, and almost impossible to imagine them falling in love, even though its obvious from the first reel that this is where the story will take them. Three, the film is far too long, and it becomes a chore to maintain attention and interest in what happens. On the plus side, there are some redeeming features. The plot plays its cards close enough to its chest that some elements of the ending come as an untelegraphed surprise. The comic touches are successful enough, especially in the bickering between the two as they try to out-do each other in getting the scoop for their respective newspaper. The camera work and editing employ some tricks to freshen up some scenes and the cuts between them. The only problem here is that once the same trick is employed more than once or twice it becomes a little tiresome. We're left with a very standard piece of work, but one that works just hard enough to keep it relatively entertaining but not quite memorable, even for Nolte and Roberts fans.",
         "Well, I wouldn't exactly describe this as a timeless classic, a thought provoking movie, or one of the legendary love stories of the silver screen. Still, it's a fun romance and an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. The tale revolves around two rival Chicago reporters, one relatively novice, Sabrina Peterson, the other the more seasoned, well known Peter Brackett, who are both hot on the trail of a train derailment story. Of course competition between them is intense (and so at times is the chemistry) as the two exchange false leads, fibs, barbs, and witty repartee. Lots of predictable action, chases, and mystery as to the identity of the bad guys. The lovely, always endearing Julia Roberts plays the journalistic sharp cookie, Sabrina, with Nick Nolte convincing in the role of her rival, Brackett. At least the pair are not hopping into bed within the first half hour (in refreshing contrast to most modern films), leaving a little time for storytelling and character development. This is definitely describable as a \"flick\" (for guys or chicks); its spirit is in keeping with its title. Personally, I'm a great Julia Roberts fan. This isn't her best picture but, nevertheless, it's quite watchable.",
         "I love trouble isn't awful or outstanding, it's simply a by the numbers, at times pleasant movie that is extremely predictable but isn't a bad choice, particularly if your a Roberts or Nolte fan. I love trouble doesn't stick out in my mind at all as either great or awful and I suppose I enjoyed it, moderately. It's not a must see but is worth seeing on a rainy day as there is absolutely nothing about it that's dreadful. This part mystery part romance relies on Nolte and Roberts to carry it and if they had been exceptional together the by the numbers and predictable factor may not have mattered. But unfortunately, Roberts and Nolte certainly don't have much chemistry and they've both been better with other leads playing opposite. There are some fun moments in this and as mentioned, it's not really bad or dull as much as utterly predictable in every way, but it's not a movie where the chemistry of the two leads or the storyline will stick in one's mind after. There's nothing wrong with predictable sometimes but as predictable movies go I have seen much much better.This is probably about average or so.",
         "\"I Love Trouble\" is an okay romantic comedy with some charm in certain points. But that's all. As a movie, it is generally watchable (at least during its first half). However, in the second half the movie seems to become way more slow, lame, goofy and with a notorious lack of interest and entertainment. Only the «crazy speed at the rain in the car» scene, the forced wedding scene and the thrilling ending (with some good action) are the good things about the second half. Other than that, not really. Why? Because before the thrilling ending, that sequence starts by taking too long to finally win some \"life\". Besides, there is a scene in a bar with dancing or country music, which is one of the most boring things for me in a movie. Not to mention that I don't see what's the point of both Peter Brackett and Sabrina Peterson keeping out-scooping each other. Nevertheless, until the first hour the movie is okay and contains some good humor. Besides, Nick Nolte is great as Peter Brackett and Julia Roberts is not bad as Sabrina Peterson. Overall, not a great movie, but certainly not as bad as they make it sound.",
         "Bland and unimaginative but many films are that what really drags this down is not the lack of chemistry between the leads but the transparent loathing they have for each other. The production of this was notoriously contentious between Roberts and Nolte and their utter abhorrence is something that seeps out of every frame of the movie. Sometimes that can fuel a set and make the picture better, as it did on I Married a Witch where Veronica Lake and Fredric March's mutual animosity somehow translated into a kinetic on screen chemistry, such is not the case here however it just makes an already weak picture that much worse. A good supporting cast and decent production values aren't enough to save this turkey. It stinks!",
         "'I Love Trouble' is a fairly entertaining film, that offers some interesting moments in the goings-on. What really stands tall in this film, are the performances by it's popular cast. 'I Love Trouble' tells the story of how 2 Competing journalists at rival papers fall in love, while exposing a government-involved scandal. Written by the husband-and-wife team of Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, The writing in the first-hour is convincing & moves easily. But, in the second hour it falters and dips for quite some time, but the culmination is nicely done. Charles Shyer's direction is fair. Cinematography & Editing are functional. The Action Sequences are interesting. Performance-Wise: Nick Nolte is terrific, as always. Julia Roberts is equally superb too. In the supporting cast, Olympia Dukakis, Robert Loggia & Saul Rubinek are noticeable. On the whole, A One-Time Watch!",
         "1st watched 2/8/2002 - 6 out of 10 (Dir-Charles Shyer): Nolte/Roberts starpower make this rather convuluted, unbelievable story watchable. A very simple title for a very over-the-top complex story that starts with two rival reporters covering a train de-railment in Chicago and ends with having something to do with a chemical that helps cows produce milk at an early age. As silly as the story plot is, we follow Nolte as a well-known name for the Chicago Chronicle, and Roberts as a newcomer for the Chicago Globe with both of them having one thing on their minds - their egos!! The movie starts out slow but once the two heroes start acting like they're actually trying to work together, things heat up. The exchanges between the two are comical and classic at times. Roberts seems to always to be matched up with some of the best male actors in Hollywood and she usually comes out holding her own, this is no exception and the movie, it's ok too.",
         "When a train crash happens, veteran newspaperman Peter Brackett is sent from the Tribune to cover the story despite him being a columnist. At the scene of the crash he meets the beautiful young reporter Sabrina Peterson who he tries to hit on without much success, before dismissing her as an inexperienced youth. The next morning she scoops him in the Globe, getting an angle on the story that he didn't have. This sparks a rivalry between the two journalists but, as they find out more about the story they find themselves in mortal danger and are forced to form an uneasy partnership. In case you are film-illiterate, this film has even called a character `Thin Man' to help you realise what it is clearly aspiring to be. The fast talking, battling characters aspire to be like those in the Thin Man series. However the main problem here is that this film has none of the wit, spark or fun of that series at it's best; instead it is all a bit lifeless and flat. The plot is good but it doesn't decide to be a mystery thriller until very late in the game; the final set piece is good but, because the film had been aiming for `playful' up till that point, it just doesn't work out well and it can't just suddenly create tension out of nowhere. The rest of the film tries to be light and witty but it doesn't manage it either. A major fault in this regard is with the script; it doesn't have any really good lines or sequences. As much as I accept that Woody Allen is not everyone's cup of tea, he would have been the perfect part of a writing team here - witty dialogue in The Thin Man style is really his thing. The other problem is with the cast. Nolte and Roberts may both be big names, but they sadly have ZERO chemistry and this is a big problem. The two have no lines and their lack of spark just makes it worse, to compare this with the Thin Man series does that a great disservice. The support cast fares a bit better and contains quite a few famous faces such as Rubinek, Rebhorn, Loggia, Dukakis, Levy, Martin Smith and Gleason. They all do OK but they can't help the failings in the script, atmosphere and in the two stars. Overall this is just about watchable but it's hard to ignore what it clearly intended to be. It is pretty much a big failure as it fails to amuse, excite or entertain on anywhere near the level that it was aiming for."

      "plotSummary": "Rival Chicago reporters Sabrina Peterson (Roberts) and Peter Brackett (Nolte) reluctantly join forces to uncover a train wreck conspiracy and bite off more than they can chew while pursuing the story and bickering along the way - and falling in love, despite the fact that he's many years older than she.Sabrina is an ambitious, gifted reporter willing to do whatever it takes to learn the truth about the train accident, which leads her into conflict, then reluctant partnership, with fading star newsman Peter who works for a rival paper. He is her polar opposite: he chases women, smokes cigars, and has just published his first novel. During their pursuit of the story, Peter and Sabrina clash over virtually everything - he also subjects Sabrina to indecent exposure in front of a group of boy scouts after he catches her skinny dipping.",
