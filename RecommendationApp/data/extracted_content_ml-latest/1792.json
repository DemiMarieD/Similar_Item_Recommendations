      "synopsis": "The film opens with closed-circuit television footage of an exchange between two men taking place in a parking garage, which appears to be foiled by agents of the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). Mark Warren (Wesley Snipes) is arrested after a traffic accident, enabling police to discover he is a federal fugitive by the name of Mark Roberts. While being transported to New York by plane, Roberts shares the flight with Deputy U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) who is traveling under the orders of his boss to get out of town following a publicized incident of alleged brutality during an arrest unrelated to Roberts' case. A Chinese prisoner attempts to assassinate Roberts by shooting him with a zip gun concealed in a toilet paper holder but the attempt fails; however it results in a plane crash due to the gunshot traveling through a window and depressurizing the cabin of the plane. After all the other prisoners are accounted for, Gerard discovers Roberts is missing and has become a fugitive again. According to DSS officials, Roberts is actually Mark Sheridan who was an operative in a mission that went bad (the footage in the opening sequence). Sheridan was framed for murdering fellow DSS agents, resulting in his criminal record. Federal officials are attempting to find a mole in the agency suspected of selling secrets to the Chinese government. DSS Special Agent John Royce (Robert Downey Jr.) joins Gerard and his team in the search. The Marshals almost catch Sheridan in a swamp, but a standoff with Gerard and Royce results in Sheridan shooting Gerard in a bullet-proof vest and then getting away. Sheridan makes it to New York City, secures money, weapons and false ID, and begins conducting surveillance on Chinese attache/spy Xian Chen (Michael Paul Chan). In Chicago, Gerard and the Marshals pursue several leads, including Roberts' girlfriend (Ir√®ne Jacob), and the airplane mechanic who hid the zip gun, the latter of whom the marshals would find killed by Chen. Gerard and team view surveillance footage that suggests that Sheridan acted in self defense, and that he could not have been identified by fingerprints at the scene as he was wearing gloves. Police reports and interviews with DSS officials, as well as electronic and foot surveillance of the girlfriend lead the team to New York on the heels of Sheridan. Eventually, the team catches up with Sheridan in a cemetery (where Sheridan had planned to confront one of the conspirators). Following a shootout with Chen, Sheridan flees to a residential home where Deputy Marshal Noah Newman (Tom Wood) is shot by Royce (who claims that Newman was actually ambushed and shot by Sheridan). Sheridan escapes by jumping onto the top of a passing train. Newman dies in transit to the hospital. After finding empty seasickness pill containers in a getaway car, Gerard locates and captures Sheridan on a ship bound for Canada, with assistance from Royce, who shoots Sheridan. Due to his behavior and change of firearm (displayed in an earlier scene), Gerard begins to suspect that Royce may be associated with the mole within the U.S. State Department and Royce is left to guard Sheridan's hospital room. He gives Sheridan a knife and attempts to kill him, to claim an attempted escape and self-defense. Gerard returns and Royce tries to shoot him to further frame Sheridan, not knowing that his gun has been switched and is empty. He pulls an alternate firearm but is fatally shot by Gerard. After leaving the hospital, Sheridan's charges are dropped and he is released.",

         "The only reason we have a film called \"U.S. Marshals\" is the cold fact that somebody was simply dying to see Tommy Lee Jones returning into his Oscar-awarded role as a tough, bold and unhesitating Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard. At first I was thinking \"just another foolish sequel\" and I have to admit that at one point it more or less even looked like \"U.S. Marshals\" is basically the same film than \"The Fugitive\" but only with Wesley Snipes in the shoes of Harrison Ford. But this is the real and the final truth: from what I remember \"The Fugitive\" was like I never considered it as all that great but since I was definitely on the edge of my seat with \"U.S. Marshals\" only logical thing would be to assume that this was naturally a better movie. I tried to avoid \"U.S. Marshals\" for many years (I've no idea why) but now when I finally saw it I was stunned by it. Interesting detail about this film as well as \"The Fugitive\" too is the peculiar fact that during the movie audience can't never really decide who's side their sympathies actually are and which one do they want to succeed: the innocent fugitive or Tommy Lee Jones' eminent marshal because clearly they're both equally heroes. \"U.S. Marshals\" is not a special thriller but it works splendidly as what it is and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Tommy Lee Jones is the ultimate star of the movie but Snipes is also pretty excellent as Sheridan. When you think of \"U.S. Marshals\" the impressive scene where Sheridan jumps onto the roof of a moving subway is already a classic. Still I'm sure that's not necessarily the only scene audience remembers. I don't know what you think but \"U.S. Marshals\" was a fine experience for me.",
         "This is an outstanding sequel to an outstanding movie The Fugitive (1993). In this film, the focus is on the team that was searching for Dr. Richard Kimble in the first movie. That team was led by Tommy Lee Jones, who won an Oscar for his performance, which probably helped spur this sequel. It worked, as Jones and company (Joe Pantoliano and others) are just as much fun to watch as they were in The Fugitive. There are many similarities to the latter, especially in the first third of the film, featuring some tremendous action scenes. Instead of a train crash, we have a plane crash. Instead of Harrison Ford on the run, we have Wesley Snipes. In both films, you have such an involving story that the two hours fly by. U.S Marshals, being the newer film of the two, has better sound and even better special effects for the action scenes. As spectacular as was the train crash in The Fugitive, the plane disaster in here is even better. The same goes for a few other scenes. There is more action in this film. Normally, I don't need that but it's so well-done here, it's fine....fun to watch. The Fugitive is still one of my all-time favorite movies. If you were entertained by it as well but are wary of sequels, you needn't be here: this is excellent.",
         "The flick talks about US Marshall Gerard ( Tommy Lee Jones ) and his detectives group ( Joe Pantoliano, La Tanya Richardson, Daniel Roebuck , Tom Wood ) who set out in pursuit an assassin and thief convict ( Wesley Snipes ) after a plane crash and he gets away . A Security Agent ( Robert Downey Jr . ) is assigned to help them but the story behind his accusation is converted more and more rare . The fugitive is only helped by his sweetheart ( Irene Jacob ). The picture is the following to ¬®The fugitive¬® ( by Andrew Davis ) that's an adaptation based on famous television series . Movie blends frenetic action, suspense, intrigue, violence and is pretty entertaining . It's a run-of-the-mill action film because since the start until the finishing the action-packed and thriller is continued .The movie is fast moving and the action pace is accurately narrated and for that reason is amusing. The release has spectacular scenes as when the plane crashing or the breathtaking pursuits in bounds and leaps and interminable runs . The numerous duels and confronting between duo protagonist are exciting and impressive . Although the first part featured by Harrison Ford obtained much more box office , this second part also achieved success in spite of the storyline was basically a rehash of the previous film that was it equally of television episodes scripted by Roy Huggins and starred by David Jansen . Magnificent and sensational musical score by the veteran Jerry Goldsmith . Awesome cinematography by Andrzej Bartkowiak ( sometimes filmmaker ) . The film is finely directed by Stuart Baird ( an usual and famed film editor ) . The motion picture will appeal to triller enthusiasts and starring duo fans . Rating : Above average . It's essential and indispensable watching .",
         "U.S. Marshals has Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard, his Oscar winning role from The Fugitive, chasing after Wesley Snipes. After a quite spectacular plane crash, the hunt is on. Snipes trying to prove he's innocent of crimes he didn't commit and Jones and his team of bloodhounds relentlessly searching for him. There is no skimping on the action and the leap from a building to a moving train is one nifty stunt. The only trouble I have is that you don't care enough about Wesley Snipes' character as you do for Harrison Ford in The Fugitive. Wesley Snipes is a former spy in the film, and he uses his skills to evade the cops. Ford was just a doctor, with no special training at all. Still, for an action film, this one delivers.",
         "I avoided this for years because it looked like a useless remake. However, I had forgotten that I thought The Fugitive was a useless remake of the TV series until I was dragged to it and found\u0085a fine, suspenseful feature filled with a plethora of colorful characters. So, I should have been tuned in more to my own personal history, but so it goes\u0085.I now have watched U.S. Marshalls a number of times, and I have to say the two companion films match each other in quality. The pacing is fast without being frenetic. The use of repetition, i.e., recurring motifs such as Kimball diving off a dam to safety & Sheridan swinging down to hop a commuter train, work well \u0096 though they could have been disastrous. The large cast is compelling down to the smallest roles (similar to The Fugitive in that regard). Jones, Snipes, and Downey all show range in their parts\u0085Downey, as always, illustrates why he is one of the best of his generation. And some of the secondary roles shine, in particular Tom Wood as Deputy Marshall Noah Newman. He receives more screen time than in the predecessor; and he makes use of it well. He has one of \"those acting moments\" in a confrontation with Downey's character: his intense expression of simultaneous fear & anger is a plum bit of acting chops. Like other IMDb readers, I wonder what has happened with this good actor. No screen credits since 2000. Stage work? Left the biz? If the former, and he's in NYC, then we'll probably see him on a Law & Order episode one of these days! I recently found a DVD with tons of extras on it \u0096 but I have not as yet delved into them. I look forward to doing that, as I do another viewing of the film.",
         "U.S. Marshals is the sequel to The Fugitive, but feels more like a remake. Again a victim of injustice is improperly imprisoned, this time Wesley Snipes in the Harrison Ford role. He's not a surgeon, but a deep undercover spy, the victim of a frame-up of an undisclosed nature. A catastrophic accident frees him (this time a plane crash) and again Tommy Lee Jones is sent to hunt him down. Big-budget, good special effects, A-list actors doing their jobs well; still U.S. Marshals fails to make a big impact. The first quarter starts out great, but by the end of the movie the plot devices are becoming very routine. Not a rip-off, but only C+ to me.",
         "\"We got ourselves a fugitive.\" Go git him Tommy Lee. Only this time the fugitive (Snipes as Sheridan) ) is a cross between Rambo, Houdini, and Superman (he actually flies). Unless you've got the I.Q. of a pigeon, you should be able to work out where this one is going. There's a lot of action, as expected, with the good guys dodging bullets, and the special effects are great. The team are still full of great one-liners, but the plot is complicated by Robert Downey Jr.(Royce), and the F.B.I. You've probably seen it anyway, so maybe you just need to decide if it's worth a second viewing. It probably is, if you're a Tommy Lee fan. The French bird is gorgeous in this.",
         "People say sequels never work-but devotees of Sam Gerard and his team would disagree with this almost immediately. I've seen this movie several times and for those who like action this movie is for them! Sure the plot is a little familiar for those that have seen the previous movie-'The Fugitive' with Tommy Lee Jones in the role as Marshal Sam Gerard, but that doesn't get in the way. The only bit that irked myself and other hard core fans of 'the team' in this film is the fact that they killed off the always lovable baby faced Newman (played by Tom Wood who is gaining a foothold in the acting business) His death sparked a great deal of conversation, FanFiction writing and an online 'funeral' held by the fans, believe it or not! So if you are a great lover of the work that Tommy Lee Jones produces, or you just like a cool action movie, U.S. Marshals is a good step away from reality. Sit Back and relax with your coffee and chocolate doughnut with the sprinkles on top!",
         "Okay, so \"U.S.Marshalls\" is basically just a remake of \"The Fugitive\". As such, it received lukewarm to cool reviews when it was in the theaters, unjustifiedly so, I think. Although the plot line is a ripoff of the earlier movie, this one does well in keeping us in suspense as to the story behind the central character, and the action is exciting and well-paced. Tommy Lee Jones of course \"makes\" the film, accompanied by the same cast of deputies as in the earlier movie. There are even \"toppers\" for the bus crash/train wreck and famous swan dive from the earlier movie. This is a very good escapist action flick.",
         "This is not as good as The Fugitive but it's still fantastic sequel, with tense and exciting action and 2 amazing performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes!. All the characters are fantastic!, and the story is awesome!, plus Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes are simply amazing in this!. It's quite underrated in my opinion, and i thought Wesley Snipes made a very sympathetic fugitive in my opinion!, plus The finale is surprising and very exciting!. A lot of people complained that Tommy Lee Jones was on auto pilot here i completely disagree, while he wasn't as good as his Oscar worthy performance in the Fugitive he was still amazing, and it's unpredictable throughout for the most part!, plus the plain crash sequence was just crazy! and very exciting stuff. It started out a bit disappointing, but then really picks up for the rest of the film, and i thought Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in his role!, plus the chase sequences were just excellent! in my opinion!. This is not as good as The Fugitive but it's still a fantastic sequel, with tense and exciting action and 2 amazing performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes!, and i say Go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Stuart Baird does a fantastic job here, with awesome camera work, fantastic angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The acting is wonderful!. Tommy Lee Jones is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is very intense, likable, had some cool lines, was fascinating to watch, and despite what people say he was not on Auto pilot, he gave it his all in my opinion and while he didn't deliver an Oscar worthy performance like he did in the fugitive he was still amazing! (Tommy Lee Rules!!!). Wesley Snipes is also amazing as always, here, he played a very sympathetic Fugitive in my opinion, was very likable, smart, and just did anything to survive, he is also very charismatic and was perfect for this role!, it's one of his best performances! (Snipes Rules!!!!). Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in his role here, he played it very low key but it worked, and made his character mysterious and very interesting i loved him!. Joe Pantoliano is great in his role i liked him lots. Daniel Roebuck did what he had to do well, which was not much. Kate Nelligan is excellent as the U.S marshal, she was likable, an had some good scenes with Tommy Lee, i just wished she had more screen time. Tom Wood (Dep. marshal Noah Newman),Marie Bineaux(Snipe's girlfriend), Donald Gibb, and the rest all do great with what they had to do!. Overall Go see it now!. ***** out of 5"
