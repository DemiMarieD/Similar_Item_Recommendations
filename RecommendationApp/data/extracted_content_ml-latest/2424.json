      "synopsis": "An updating of 1940 The Shop Around the Corner and the1949 musical version, In the Good Old Summertime, to the Internet Age, You've Got Mail follows the squabbling and romance of two competing book retailers on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Kathleen Kelly ( Meg Ryan) awakens to the latest comments by her newspaper columnist boyfriend Frank Navasky ( Greg Kinnear) on how computers are ushering in the fall of civilization. Once she has made quite sure Frank has left for the day, Kathleen starts her computer and goes on-line. She doesn't want Frank to know that she's exchanging e-mails with a man she's never met, Joe Fox ( Tom Hanks). He is also keeping this a secret from his own girlfriend, publishing executive Patricia Eden ( Parker Posey). Kathleen and Joe avoid discussing anything that might reveal their identities to each other, keeping to such subjects as pets, the changing seasons, and the charm of New York. They know each other only by their Internet handles \"Shopgirl\" and \"NY152\". Joe is an important executive in his family's business, Fox & Sons, a bookstore chain. Currently, he is readying a new \"Superstore\" (like a large Borders or Barnes & Noble). He has a bit of trouble attending to work rather than musing on Shopgirl's latest e-mail, but friend and subordinate Kevin ( Dave Chappelle) finally gets him to focus. Joe says that although the locals won't think they want a big chain store, he knows he can seduce them with discount prices and cappuccino. Joe decides it's time to put up signs announcing that the Superstore is coming. Meanwhile, Kathleen starts a new day at her charming little children's bookstore, \"The Shop Around the Corner\", a long-time local landmark. She has doubts about her on-line relationship and discusses with cyber-savvy employee Christina ( Heather Burns) whether it counts as cheating on Frank. Ultimately, she decides there's no real problem because \"It's nothing.\" At Fox Books corporate HQ, Joe reports on the new store's progress and potential competition (including The Shop Around the Corner) to his father ( Dabney Coleman) and grandfather ( John Randolph). The latter revels that Kathleen's store was founded by her mother, with whom he had briefly exchanged letters and found her \"enchanting\". Another piece of news: Joe's father is planning to marry his taste-challenged girlfriend Gillian ( Cara Seymour), the mother of his four-year old son Matt ( Jeffrey Scaperrotta). This becomes another item to share in an e-mail to Shopgirl, who responds with anecdotes of her own. Kathleen's employees are dismayed to see the \"Fox Books Superstore coming soon\" sign on a building only half a block from The Shop Around the Corner. However, Kathleen is confident that her store's vastly superior service will prevent this from damaging her business. She ignores the ominous words from staffer George ( Steve Zahn), \"But they discount.\" Boyfriend Frank is quite supportive of Kathleen's optimistic assessment, but entirely oblivious to her uncertainties about whether running the store is really all she wants to do in her life. These are sentiments she can only share with NY152. One day, Joe is left in charge of his half-brother Matt and his Aunt Annabel ( Hallee Hirsh), who is Joe's grandfather's ten-year-old daughter. In search of ways to keep them entertained, he takes them to a reading at The Shop Around the Corner, where he finally meets Kathleen in person. Joe is determined not to spoil a pleasant encounter by revealing that he's her competitor. The kids seem determined to spill the beans (Matt shows off the only word he can spell - FOX), but Joe laughs this off, manages to change the subject, and leaves with his secret intact. Still unknown to either of them is the bigger secret that they are each other's e-mail correspondents. The Superstore finally opens and is a big hit. The effect on Kathleen's sales is immediate and sharp. She claims this is just because the Fox store is new and that things will soon be back to normal, but she seems to be trying to convince herself. She and Frank attend an author friend's party, where she runs into Joe. He tries to preserve his anonymity, but is soon unmasked. His earlier attempts at secrecy now completely backfire, as Kathleen is convinced that Joe was spying on her. Her accusations, and her apparent contempt for big stores like Joe's, provoke him to belittle her shop as \"insignificant but full of its own virtue.\" Late that night, Joe has trouble sleeping because he regrets some of the nasty things he said to Kathleen, but he can only reveal this to his confidante, Shopgirl. She admires his ability to come up with deflating comments on the spot, something she's never been able to do. From this point on, relations between Kathleen and Joe become icy, and they usually avoid acknowledging each other when they happen to meet, which occurs surprisingly often. After further discussion with longtime friend and store bookkeeper Birdie ( Jean Stapleton), Kathleen admits that the problems at her store aren't going to solve themselves, and writes to NY152 for advice. Since she won't reveal to him that she's in the book business, he gives her general business advice summed up in the Godfather quote \"Go to the mattresses\". He explains this as meaning \"Fight to the death\" and also gives her his mantra \"It's not personal, it's business\". Kathleen accepts this advice and starts an anti-Fox Books campaign, including media coverage, a neighborhood rally, and picketing at the Superstore. This, particularly Kathleen's TV interview where she twists some of his words to suit her purposes, is aggravating to Joe, but ultimately doesn't have any impact on her sales problem. Finally, Kathleen decides that to get the support she needs in this crisis, she should meet NY152 in person. The on-line friends, still not exchanging names, arrange to meet at Cafe Lalo. Joe brings Kevin along and has him check out who's there (with the agreed upon identifier, a book with a rose). Kevin recognizes Kathleen from her TV interview and lets Joe know. Resenting that Shopgirl turns out to be someone he dislikes, he threatens to leave, but finally enters the cafe. However, rather than revealing that he's NY152, he pretends he has again merely bumped into her. He makes cynical comments about her book, Pride and Prejudice, and the fact that someone has apparently stood her up. As their arguing progresses, Kathleen finally comes up with a dig that succeeds in hurting Joe, \"You are nothing but a suit\". He leaves, and at first seems unwilling to continue their on-line exchanges. After he reads an e-mail expressing how she values NY152, plus her regrets for being cruel to the unpleasant person who was there instead of him, he resumes the correspondence. Changes in the characters' lives quickly follow. Kathleen decides to close her store. She and Frank admit they aren't in love, and part amicably. Joe has an epiphany on a stuck elevator and leaves Patricia, moving to his boat. Although it involves no immediate financial hardship, the store closing is painful for Kathleen, as it ends a connection she had to her mother. Joe's dad breaks up with Gillian, who has started a relationship with Matt's nanny ( Katie Finneran). While discussing this with Joe, he mocks the notion of ever finding \"the one person who fills you with true joy\" - at which Joe appears to come to a realization. Still not revealing that he's NY152, Joe makes a concerted effort to become friends with Kathleen. He brings her flowers when she has a cold and accepts her criticism of his \"It's not personal, it's business\" philosophy. When she reveals that she only knows the man she was expecting at Cafe Lalo from e-mail, he encourages her to meet him. Joe gently stops Kathleen as she's about to make a crack he knows she'll later regret, and they are both surprised by the intimacy of the moment. On following days, he manages to spend more time with her, showing that he can be amusing and supportive. Kathleen mentions that she is making progress as a children's author and that NY152 had given her the idea to try. One day, she tells Joe that she in finally going to meet NY152 later that afternoon. Joe expresses his regrets about the hostility at the beginning of their relationship, and says if it hadn't been for this, he would have asked her out \"for as long as we both shall live\". Kathleen is moved, but has to leave for her rendezvous. This time there are no tricks, and when she sees Joe and realizes what this means, she tells him \"I wanted it to be you.\" They kiss - a bit awkwardly at first, but then with conviction.",

         "I've been starved for a great romantic film and YOU'VE GOT MAIL more than sated my appetite! I'd rank it right up there with CASABLANCA as one of the most romantic movies of all time. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have more chemistry than a High School Science Department! This movie was warm, funny, smart, and sexy. Tom and Meg light up the screen and Tom Hanks is the perfect hero! The movie was 2 hours long, felt like 10 minutes, and I didn't want it to be over! This is a definite keeper, and I can't wait for it to come out on video so I can watch it again and again!",
         "This movie was so much better than I expected, which was a simple romantic comedy with predictable \"pass each other in the street\" scenarios throughout. I was pleasantly surprised to find a love story that touched my heart. Kathleen's vulnerability and pride in her mother made me cry and Joe's sensitivity and devious behavior were so very sweet. I didn't think that Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan could pull off a romance better than they did in Sleepless In Seattle but I am happy to be mistaken.",
         "I'm from Germany and I love this film! It makes me happy to just watch it! When watching this film one comes to think why in real life such beauty in words and moments can't be achieved! The film does'nt get boring, even if watched for the 23rd time! It's pure magic - you could endlessly listen to the conversations, the beautiful music and enjoy the excellent acting! Other films try to come in too trendy with freaky music and sexual content(not that there's anything wrong with that) - but it's not a feelgood movie! Besides the puns and the lovely warm hearted atmosphere does the rest! To everyone who hasn't yet seen this movie - rent it, buy it - enjoy it!",
         "Romantic comedies are not everyone's cup of tea; after all, who would want to watch unrealistic stories about ordinary people 'coupling' when we are offered such wonderful everyday experiences as ten car pileups, hordes of people being slaughtered in a hail of bullets while shopping, goblins, explosions, vampires and intergalactic spaceships? But the majority of women, and many of those men who do not see themselves as the Governor of California will surely find much to like in this charming eye-moistener. Tales of this ilk can easily be mawkish, but this one largely avoids the trap, thanks to an intelligent script, the believability of the lead pair (as well as the supporting cast) and good pacing that leaves the denouement until the closing shot.",
         "In films like You've Got Mail, where you can almost predict how it's going to turn out as soon as the opening credits appear, then it is up to the writers, director, and actors, to get us to enjoy the journey to the end credits. Nora and Delia Ephron's script succeeds because they know their characters well, and give them a can't miss plot device. Tom Hanks is believable as the head of a gigantic bookstore chain, as is Meg Ryan as the owner of a small children's bookstore shop. As the guy who is putting Meg out of business by opening a chain store close to her little shop, Tom Hanks character comes across as the arrogant person who only goal seems to open as many bookstores as he can, and make as much money as he can in doing so. When he is talking to Meg Ryan on the internet, we see another side of him, and learn that possibly, he's not the evil guy you think he is. Of course, in person, Meg hates him for what he is doing, on the internet, she falls in love with him. This is what makes the film work, as their reaction to each other in person is completely different from when they talk on line. Some people may quibble that the ending is not very believable, but face it, do you fall in love with a person because of who they are, or what you think they are? I think this question is answered quite adequately.",
         "I was pleasantly surprised to find \"Mail\" not to be a rehash of \"Sleepless.\" Ryan and Hanks do work exceptionally well together! Three-quarters into the movie I was wondering how they would ever pull off a romantic and yet believable ending, but the scene at the garden was one of those perfect moments in filmmaking. It just rang true and consistent with the story. I really enjoyed this one! (And hearing Harry Nilsson's music again, used so beautifully, was icing on the cake!)",
         "...except for the fact that this movie made me so happy! I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan and I collect all of his movies, and it has been quite some time since i've seen a really good and special movie of his. He's just such a wonderful actor and Meg Ryan's just... Well, she's just so great, always happy and when she's acting she always makes me laugh, cause she's just so wonderful! Let's talk about this movie: I'm gonna be honest with you, this isn't Forrest Gump or The Green Mile, but it is romantic, special, wonderful and it made me smile and wish for them to get together in the film, and in the end I was just happier then before! I think it's underrated, but everyone has a special taste, and I just loved it! I seriously recommend it to every Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan fan, you are not going to regret it! Thank you for your time.",
         "Pleasant, undemanding fluff reworks 1940's \"The Shop Around the Corner\" (remade initially in 1949 as the musical \"In The Good Old Summertime\") and reteams Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan for the second time in genial plot about rival bookstore owners. She operates a Mom & Pop bookshop, he's opening another outlet in his retail chain nearby; they lock horns over business, yet are unaware they are also each other's internet pen-pal. Slick and occasionally too-cute, but very entertaining picture with a holiday theme. Ryan is delightful, Hanks less so (he's rote, and looks tired to boot), but Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton and Steve Zahn make up a terrific supporting cast. Engaging and lots of fun. *** from ****",
         "It was hard not to give this movie a 10, but since I have only given out about 20 10's in all the movies I have ever seen - thousands, a 10 here would have been a little too generous. Though, it is difficult to find fault, I suppose it is fair to say that the movie didn't always have full steam - especially early on. Still, even during those times, it was interesting. I mean, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. What else do you need? Additionally, I didn't laugh very much. Not that I was required to, but this genre would, after all, be considered a romantic comedy. Despite the lack of laughs, it was as feel good as it gets. The movie was blessed with two great actors, a creative idea, excellent writing and directing. And, the ending was one for the ages. I might have chosen to \"tweak\" it a little, but it was about as good as you will ever see - assuming you like romance. I do!",
         "If you have been reading the last three reviews I did, this is the natural concluding review of the sequence. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, and SHE LOVES ME all were based (in the central plot about two people at loggerheads in physical life, falling in love through anonymity in pen-pal letters) on Miklos Laszlo's PERFUMERIE. They all had their differences in a secondary plot dealing with the jealousy of the owner of the store towards the hero (his closest employee) resulting in his firing the hero due to a serious mistake by the employer. This was jettisoned and altered in the middle film, but resumed in the Kander and Ebb musical of the 1970s (made into a television version in 1978). But that version actually gave the actual villain a parting shot in his last song, showing he was down, but not out, and would still find a way of getting an undeserved success. When Nora Ephron did her version of the play in this screenplay, the jealousy angle was dumped, and the concentration was on the business antagonism between the hero and heroine (here Tom Hanks as Joe Fox, and Meg Ryan as Kathleen Kelly). Hanks and Ryan do not work at the same store as James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan or Van Johnson and Judy Garland did. Hanks works at a mega book store (Fox Books) like Barnes and Noble. Ryan runs a small neighborhood book store for children, called \"The Shop Around The Corner\" (Hanks takes her to task for that name, saying it can't be claimed as a single corporate name). Fox Books is moving into the neighborhood that Ryans's store is in, and she fights it's irresistible push - in vain as it is. In the end not only is she the loser, but members of her staff get hired by Fox Books as well. There are other elements here that do not come out in the original version or the 1949 version. The protagonists don't write letters, but are sending e-mails to each other. Times are changing, and the discovery of a small notice in the newspaper's classified for a pen-pal is replaced by Ryan meeting Fox accidentally in surfing the internet and finding a chat room (a scene we are told of, but never see). In the 1949 film, Garland was pursued (if you will - somewhat weakly) by Johnson's friend and fellow employee Buster Keaton. Johnson was linked (by Garland) to a female friend who was a violinist. Neither relationship was that strong or threatening to the eventual Johnson-Garland relationship. But for the first half of YOU'VE GOT MAIL, Ryan is living with a self-righteous newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear), and Hanks is living with a self-centered publisher (Parker Posey). We barely knew the families of Sullivan and Garland (we saw an aunt or two that they lived with). Here we know that Ryan's mother is dead, but her grandmother Birdie (Jean Stapleton) is alive and thriving. In fact we learn Birdie is rich due to a stock investment and that she once dated John Randolph, Hanks' grandfather. In fact, we even learn that Birdie romanced one of the most interesting political figures of 20th Century Europe. Hanks' family is developed too, beyond Stewart's or Johnson's (or Ellis's for that matter). Besides grandfather Randolph (about to remarry), we see Hanks' father (Dabney Coleman), who keeps running through wives and never finding the right mate. We also meet Hank's aunt and brother. The film worked well again, and just as the early pairs of couples (Stewart and Sullivan, Johnson and Garland) had good chemistry, so did Hanks and Ryan. This was their third film together (people forget they did JOE AND THE VOLCANO first), and the second film (after SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE) with Ephron at the helm. With all the modernization and story changes, and character histories, and assaults on the concept of mega-stores (check the scene where Hanks hears an inept salesman in the children's book section), Epron managed to show the old warhorse by Mr. Laszlo still had plenty of juice in it to go down well with the public. My guess is that like Lubitsch's original film it will end up a classic version of the story. My wonder is what will be the next version be like."
