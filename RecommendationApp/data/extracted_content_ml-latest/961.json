      "synopsis": "It's a snowy, cold Christmas in 1880's Brooklyn, New York, USA. \"I never saw a man meet death with finer courage!\" says the doctor. Mrs. Errol (Dolores Costello Barrymore) comes out of the room where Captain Errol had died. She tells her young son Cedric (Freddie Bartholomew) that Father is finally better. But mother and son are now all alone in the world! Now it's spring. And Cedric's birthday! Cedric's mother and their maid Mary (Una O'Connor) give Cedric birthday gifts including a new bicycle. Cedric rides the bike out to show his Brooklyn friends. The local applewoman, Mrs. McGillicuddy, a poor Brooklyn street vendor (Jessie Ralph), talks to Cedric and admires his new bike. Later, a gang of older boys stop his bicycle riding and taunt Cedric Errol about his English accent. He says he's an American but Cedric says firmly \" My father was British...if it's any concern of yours!\". When these boys insult his mother, he fights them singlehandedly, until his good friend Dick Tipton (Mickey Rooney) drops his shoeshine equipment and joins Cedric in the fight. A friendly Irish American cop (Robert Emmett O'Connor) breaks up the fight and the big boys scatter. Officer O'Brien smiles and assures Cedric that he knew Cedric and Dick would have won, but he just didn't want them to be \"...commitin' murder!\". Cedric then visits Hobbs Fancy Vegetables & Groceries and his friend storeowner Mr. Hobbs (Guy Kibbee). He sits on the cracker barrel and listens to Mr. Hobbs rail aginst British nobility. Mr. Hobbs, tells Cedric how he considers British earls a bad lot. Mr. Hobbs waves his newspaper as he, the staunch American, exclaims, \"I''ll have no graspin' tyrants [ earls] sitting on MY cracker barrel!\" Just then, maid Mary comes to fetch Cedric home. Mary says \"Weird strange things happenin' to us!\" British lawyer Mr. Havisham (Henry Stephenson) has come to America by order of Cedric's unseen paternal grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt. Mr. Havisham explains that young Cedric is now the only living heir to his British grandfather's title and estates. Mrs. Errol reluctantly agrees to bring Cedric to Britain since her husband, the late Captain Errol would have wished it! Mr. Havisham warns Mrs. Errol that the old Earl does not wish to see her as he is quite prejudiced against Americans and is fixed in his determination not to see her. She, thus, cannot enter the Dorincourt Estates, but must live in a home nearby where Cedric can visit. Distressed Mrs. Errol accepts the home, but refuses the money offered with the house, as she has a small income of her own. Mrs. Errol also asks that Mr. Havisham not tell Cedric why she must live apart because it would make it harder for Cedric and his grandfather to be friends. Mr. Havisham assures him that Cedric will thank her for her that someday. Young Cedric, back in Mr. Hobbs' store, confesses, \"Mr. Hobbs. I will no deceive you. An earl is sitting on this cracker barrel now.\" Later, Mr. Havisham enjoys dinner at the Errol's small Brooklyn home. He and Cedric talk about what an earl is. Cedric is happy to hear that he will be rich. Now he could buy all his poor friends needed items and presents for his mother. (He tells Mr. Havisham \"I call her Dearest because that's what my father called her.) Cedric's mother is called away by a needy neighbor, Bridget, whose husband Michael can't work because he's sick. Mr. Havisham gives Cedric money as a gift from his grandfather which Cedric immediately gives to Bridget. \"My grandfather must be a very good man!\" concludes Cedric. The new Lord Fauntleroy now goes out to say goodbye and to bring gifts to his friends, Dick Tipton (whose new shoeshine stand is from Cedric), Mr. Hobbs (who gets a new pipe and engraved watch), and the Apple Woman (who wears a warm new shawl from Cedric). In Britain, Mrs. Errol, in her new home near Dorincourt Estate, tells Cedric they must live apart. However, she promises they will see each other daily and Cedric becomes a little more cheerful. That evening, Mr. Havisham goes to Dorincourt Castle. A distressed servant tells the lawyer that these past few weeks have been horrible. The old Earl is heard (off camera) yelling at another servant, \"You blockhead...!\" Mr. Havisham then reports to the Earl about Cedric's safe arrival in Britain. The old Earl is surprised and suspicious that Mrs. Errol will not take the extra income. Mr. Havisham suggests that the Earl not speak disparagingly of Cedric's mother to her young son as she has all his affection. The next day, young Cedric rides up with Mr. Havisham to meet the old Earl, his grandfather, on the grand Dorincourt Estate. After greeting the household staff (who are all delighted to meet the new Little Lord Fauntleroy) he enters - alone - into the great library where sits the old Earl (Sir C. Aubrey Smith) and his large mastiff dog. \"How do you do! I'm Lord Fauntleroy!\" Cedric, who has quickly befriended the Earl's large mastiff dog, walks with the dog across the large library and extends his small hand to his grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt. The old Earl is impressed with young Cedric's intelligent conversation on various subjects. He learns many amazing things about the new Little Lord Fauntleroy. He learns that his grandson cares for his humble Brooklyn friends Bridget, Dick and the Apple Woman; was thinking of being a grocer but would go into the House of Lords if that is a good business; and has decided views about influencing world politics. Cedric even declares, \"If there was a war, I would try to stop it!\" The old Earl also learns that Cedric loves his dead father (Captain Errol); and that Cedric even loves him. The amazed Earl (used to only contempt and fear from others) then actually comforts the young boy who is now homesick for his mother. Later, the local minister Mr. Mordaunt calls on the old Earl. Mr. Mordaunt pleads for the Earl not to evict the Higgins family who are behind in their rent. Cedric listens to their tale of sicknesses and financial woes and he exclaims, \"That's like Michael!\" \"I forgot we had a philanthrophist here!\" The amused old Earl dictates a letter Cedric will write and sign. The Dorincourt tenant manager is thus directed to let Tom Higgins and family stay on. \"I hope when I grow up I shall be just like you!\" says Cedric. The delighted minister leaves to deliver the good news to the Higginses. Then, the old Earl tempts Cedric to skip his daily visit to his mother to see the surprise, a new pony in the stables. \"Whose pony is it?\" says eager young Cedric. \"Yours\" says the Earl. But Cedric will not stay and miss his daily visit with his beloved mother. Cedric is bewildered when the Earl will not get out to say hello to \"Dearest\" his mother. As the earl's carriage drives away, he sees Cedric run to his dear mother's arms. As the villagers and tenants go to church the next day, they talk about the wonderful new Lord Fauntleroy and his charming American mother. They greet his mother who, with Mary, walks into church. \"He's the Captain Cedric! All over again!\" In the church service, Cedric sees an inscription on a tomb \"Here lyeth the First Earl Gregory Arthure and his Wife Allsone Hildegarde \". Cedric whispers to his Grandfather \"Who are they?\" The old Earl says \"They are \"earlier distinguished ancestors of yours\". Cedric figures he got his bad spelling from them. After church, tenant Tom Higgins thanks Cedric for interceding for him. Cedric marvels at the smiles of the people and assumes it's because they love his grandfather. Later Cedric writes Mr. Hobbs, \"He is such a good Earl, he reminds me of you. He is a universal favorite!\" Back in Brooklyn, NY at Hobb's Finer Groceries, Mr. Hobbs and street urchin and shoeshine boy Dick Tipton talk about Cedric and read his letter aloud. Mr. Hobbs still thinks earls are haughty and mean and laments that Cedric \"would have been a shining light in the grocery business\". Mr. Hobbs finds out Dick has no good place to sleep and says that Dick can sleep for free in his loft. \"You're not an earl, Mr. Hobbs. You're a prince!\" exclaims the grateful young shoeshine boy. At Dorincourt Castle, the Earl throws a lavish party to introduce Cedric, the new Lord Fauntleroy, to society. The Earl's younger sister, Lady Constantia (Constance Collier) and her husband Sir Harry Lorridaile (E. E. Clive) are delighted to meet their grand-nephew Cedric. She tells Cedric \"I loved your father more than most people in this wicked world!\" Cedric is a hit with the guests. However, the old Earl notices that Mr. Havisham is grim. After the party, Mr. Havisham tells the Earl that his oldest son's child has come forth and apparently is the rightful heir. The old Earl is angry, and then ashamed. \"You say that she [the new boy's mother] is an ignorant, vulgur person?\" \"She can hardly spell her own name and is openly mercenary!\" says the lawyer. \"And I objected to...HIS mother!\" says the repentant Earl, as he looks down upon sleeping young Cedric. The villagers talk near the inn where Minna, the former wife of Bevis, (the Earl's deceased oldest son) is staying. They discuss how hard this new claimant is upon the Lord Dorincourt! Everyone knows that the grandson Cedric has worked a great change in the old Earl. The old Earl and Mr. Havisham meet Minna who is now Lady Fauntleroy (Helen Flint ) and her lawyer Mr. Joshua Snade at the inn. She confronts the old Earl, hoping to get plenty of money, and her son (Jackie Searl) sucks on a lollipop and stares dumbly. \"Your son Bevis married me all right. A fine rotter he was. But he was the father of my boy...Now if you want to come down off your high horse and be reasonable...!\" she smirks. The old Earl, in disgust, promises the lawful heir will get his due, but forbids her to enter Dorincourt till after his death. Several lawyers find no fault in Minna's paperwork. The old Earl is grieved again at how he objected to Cedric's mother. He calls on Mrs. Errol and asks her forgiveness. She comforts the stricken Earl. Back in Brooklyn, Mr. Hobbs is getting a shoe shine at Dick Tipton's fancy new shoeshine stand Cedric had given him. Mr. Hobbs reads aloud a news story about the new Lord Fauntleroy and Dick looks at the picture. Dick exclaims \"That's Minna! Ben's [former] wife! \". They suspect fraud and go off to contact the old Earl. Later, at the inn near Dorincourt, Minna and lawyer Joshua Snade, confined in the small quarters, snap at each other. She wishes to party in London, but doesn't want to leave the area till the Earl settles money on her. Suddenly the Earl, Mr. Havisham, her second former husband Ben Tipton, and his younger brother grinning young Dick Tipton enter her quarters. \"There's a little matter of a forged birth certificate!\" Her boy is discovered hiding in a back bedroom. He is identified by the Tiptons as Ben Tipton's son and thus the fraud is exposed. Time to celebrate Cedric's 10th birthday. Cedric fills in an engraved invitation for his birthday party to Silas Hobbs. We now see a May birthday celebration at the Castle. The townspeople and tenants and American visitors Mr. Hobbs and Dick Tipton cheer on Cedric after his speech. \"I didn't know the little fellow could talk so good!\" says Dick. The Earl shows Mr. Hobbs around Dorincourt Castle's portrait hall. They view the Earl's earlier distinguished ancestors. Mr. Hobbs admits \"You know Earl, you're not a bad sort. I wouldn't have minded being an earl myself!\" \"I'm very gratified\" says the Earl. The Earl has another birthday present for the delighted Cedric. His mother comes into the room. \"She's come to live with us...We've always wanted her,\" the Earl admits...\"We just weren't aware of it!\" Mrs. Errol is glad to see her old friend, Mr. Hobbs and says, \"We dread you going back to America!\" The new Anglophile American Silas Hobbs says \"Not to live there. America is a good place for the young and stern. But there's not an earl - nor an ancestor - among them!\" FINIS",

         "The Earl of Dorincourt, lonely in his great castle, has grown old. Now, with the death of both of his sons, he sends for his only grandchild to be with him. This is an innocent boy living in New York City with his American mother. Sweet-tempered and beloved, the earnest young child knows nothing of the crusty, fierce old lord in England, or of the wonderful changes about to happen in his own life, now that he is LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY. This is David O. Selznick's wonderful & lavish retelling of the classic children's story by Frances Hodgson Burnett. Much effort was put into getting the details just right. Sentimental? Yes, but honest sentiment, with emotions straight from the heart. Freddie Bartholomew & marvelous Sir C. Aubrey Smith are picture perfect in their roles as young Fauntleroy & his grandfather. There may never be a finer male child actor than Master Bartholomew and Sir C. was the epitome of the English aristocratic tradition. Two champion scene-stealers, they work together beautifully. The rest of the cast is both extensive & uniformly excellent: Dolores Costello Barrymore, Henry Stephenson, Guy Kibbee, Jessie Ralph, Una O'Connor, Constance Collier, E. E. Clive, Lionel Belmore, Eily Maylon & Mickey Rooney. Film mavens will spot uncredited appearances by Mary Gordon as a churchgoing villager & Leonard Kibrick as one of Fauntleroy's Brooklyn tormentors. Sir Hugh Walpole, the celebrated English novelist, wrote the screen adaptation.",
         "They just don't make 'em like this anymore. You can take all your Culkins and Woods and Osments and roll them into one, and they still couldn't shine the shoes of Freddie Bartholemew (as Mickey Rooney does in this film). The difference, I believe, is that these contemporary performers think of themselves as CHILD actors, where Bartholemew and his contemporary Shirley Temple thought of themselves as ACTORS -- just as Rooney's character thought of himself as a BUSINESSMAN. The effect is palpable: you just can't fake being a real person. This of course is the familiar story of an American boy in the 1880's who learns he is the heir to an English earl and must go live with the old bloke, who parenthetically hates his mother, in an old castle. Needless to say, it is the earl who is transformed by the strength and purity of the boy's character, and not the intended reverse. Every scene and every line in this film is perfect, and if it is a \"period piece,\" then I say we'd be so much better off if we could return to that \"period.\"",
         "1880 , Brooklyn , New York , a poor and fatherless boy ( Freddie Bartholomew ) is living with his mum ( Dolores Costello ). A messenger ( Henry Stephenson ) communicate them which he turns out to be the only heir state to the earl of Dorincourt ( Sir C. Aubrey Smith ) . He then leaves his friends ( Mickey Rooney and Guy Kibbee ) and set out for England as heir to his grandpa and a British dukedom . But the grandfather is a grumpy and crusty nobleman and the problems are always cropping up . Classic and the best version based on known novel by Frances Burnett with elitist and sincere interpretations from Bartholomew , Aubrey Smith , Rooney , enough to make the creaky ancient tale actually works . Freddie Bartholomew had starred ¨Anna Karenina¨ and ¨David Copperfield¨ but his great success resulted out to be this film . Dolores Costello, married to John Barrymore , plays the lovable mummy in an affected and forced acting . Sir C. Aubrey Smith is magnificent as the bitter-grumbler and grouchy count . Una O'Connor ,as always, plays a maid with her habituals gestures and grimaces . For comic relief ,as usual, appears Mickey Rooney making a hilarious and sympathetic acting . This was originally made in black and white with an excellent cinematography by Charles Rosher but there is also available in computer-colorized version and the musical score is composed by the classical musician Max Steiner . Director John Cromwell worked a lot with the great and powerful producer David O. Selznick and seems largely to have been content to follow his instructions , though he was always loath to allow too much sentimentality as happens on the sometimes heavily relationship between mother-son and grandfather-grandson . The picture was remade for television in 1980 by Jack Gold with Alec Guinness and Rick Schroder and in 1976 by Paul Annett and 1995 with George Baker . The motion picture was immensely successful in America and around the world , it is actually an authentic and charming classic movie .",
         "This altogether lovely, exquisite period piece represents Hollywood filming at its height, no doubt. But what almost destroys its timelessness is the terribly bad condition of the film, reportedly taken from a television showing some years ago, complete with some of the worst damage I have ever seen in an old Hollywood classic. The memory of David O. Selznick deserves better than this shoddy monument to his great vision of the Burnett book. It is simply unforgivable that various \"discount\" houses continue to offer this and so many other dreadful copies of great films to a gullible and unsuspecting public. The complete restoration of this film is LONG overdue. And the various slashing of scenery, dialogue, for whatever greedy reason, is appalling, just appalling. After having seen so very many films on VHS and now DVD over many years, I submit that this is the most heartbreaking kind of butchery of a great, noble effort of any of the great directors and producers in the long history of American filming. Please, won't someone - the AFI, TCM, restoration companies, ANYONE - step up and lovingly bring this lovingly created film back into the sunshine of clarity, wholeness and beauty???!!! I have little faith in our rapidly decaying culture as we enter the new century, especially when such travesties occur. Once again, there is absolutely NO valid, logical excuse for this. Sorry for popping off so much, but I have watched it all too many times before. To use an offensive word appropriate for my feelings - it's bullshit...",
         "Two great 1930's child actors, Freddie Bartholomew and Mickey Rooney, play Little Lord Fauntleroy--Cedric Errol, and streetwise American friend Dick Tipton respectively. (Part British Ceddie fights the bullies--and Dick Tipton runs to help...they fight together. A preview of what a lot of Brits & Americans did in WWII a few years after this film!!!) Also watch for Sir C. Aubrey Smith as the definitive hostile old Lord Dorincourt, who is charmed and warmed by his newly-met half American grandson's unconditional love. Character actor Guy Kibbee also seems made to play staunch anti-aristocrat American Silas Hobbs. If you read the book (free online), the movie fits it well! Did you know the book LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY was an incredible late 19th century \"hit\"? Some statesmen actually credit this tale of reconciliation between an old Earl and his half American grandson with improving the then-strained 19th century British-American relationship. Drew Barrymore's grandmother Dolores Costello Barrymore plays Cedric's charming American Mother. While this film needs a sound and picture cleanup, it is still worth the watch!(TO YOU FILM PEOPLE--LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS OLD FILM. CAN'T SOMEONE CLEAN UP THE PICTURE & SOUND?)",
         "A nine year old Brooklyn boy nicknamed \"Ceddie\" (Freddie Bartholomew), beloved by all who know him due to his kindly nature, finds himself in for a most unexpected change of lifestyle when he learns he's to be heir to the estate of his grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith), a British Earl and has to move in with him. A bigger challenge for the boy to overcome though is to bring down the barrier between his stubborn, set in his ways grandfather and Ceddie's mother \"Dearest\" (Dolores Costello), who the Earl resents his son marrying as she's an American. This one really grabs you by the heartstrings and doesn't let up. Freddie Bartholomew is simply wonderful as \"Ceddie\", wonderfully capturing his character and winning over the viewing audience's hearts in fairly short time, no easy feat for a child star. C. Aubrey Smith too is just marvelous as the crotchety old grandfather who finds his stubborn, hard-hearted, icy exterior being worn away just by being in the presence of such a terrific young lad who loves him unconditionally. Dolores Costello too was nicely cast and delivers the goods when she's called upon to do so. It's the likable performances given by these stars that make this a real winner in that we're truly made to care about these characters and what happens to them.",
         "This is a good adaptation of the story of \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\", with a very good cast that brings the characters to life in a believable and entertaining fashion. Besides telling the enjoyably old-fashioned family story, the movie adds some nice scenes that simply emphasize the relationships among the characters. This is one of Freddie Bartholomew's best roles, and he seems pretty natural in the part of Fauntleroy. The adult cast features some very good performances. Dolores Costello is a good choice as the gentle 'Dearest', Henry Stephenson is well-cast as the faithful Haversham, and C. Aubrey Smith seems the very embodiment of a bad-tempered Earl. But perhaps the best performances come from Guy Kibbee and a young Mickey Rooney, as Cedric's American friends. Their camaraderie in their scenes with Bartholomew works particularly well, and they figure in some of the movie's best moments. The story is just the familiar old tale, with young Cedric leaving his humble but cozy existence in Brooklyn to go to England, where he must contend with his grandfather's coldness towards his mother and with other challenges. But it's the kind of story that's easy to watch over again when it is told the right way.",
         "Break out the insulin! This antique heartwarmer, awash in tears and goodness, is risibly sentimental, but David Selznick made it an expert entertainment as well. Plucky Freddie Bartholomew is just about irresistible as the Brooklyn boy who becomes an earl. Melting hearts left and right, he wins over his crusty grandfather, becomes a philanthropist in a sailor suit, and fights the local toughs to prove he is NOT a sissy! C.Aubrey Smith seemed born to play the venerable old gentleman, although he relies a bit too much on acting with his monocle. Mickey Rooney stands out as the loyal Brooklyn shoeshine boy. This is the film to watch if you've never actually heard anyone say, \"Cheezit, the cops!\"",
         "John Cromwell gets a lot of credit for this Selznick Studio release. It is only the second time (at that time) the story had been filmed. The first was a poor silent version. Although Cromwell could have developed the story a bit more, it is well cast. Bartholomew is excellent as young Cedrick and Smith is fine as the crusty old Earl who learns to love his grandson, additionally Rooney as Dick the bootblack, and Kibbee as storekeeper Hobbs are also outstanding. Although heavy with sentimentality, Cromwell has done an excellent job of cutting out all the terrible wordiness of the novel. (Burnett writes as though she is being paid by the word and puts in way to many adjectives.) The story is well told and the scenic effects are good for their time. Unfortunately the film has not aged well and some scenes have darkened with time. Perhaps an enterprising admirer will trouble to restore this film. IF they do, hopefully they will also restore the missing scenes so the film runs its full length. A discount film hawker (Front Row Video, Canada) has the nerve to sell copies of the film (claiming a running time of 1:42) that are so butchered, that two conversations are cut right in the middle with a change of scene. Digiview Productions who states on the front cover \"Sometimes the price we pay is too high\" and charges only a dollar for their DVD version, has been caught with their foot in their mouth. They only charge a buck, but even that is too much for the hacked up 92 minute version of the film they sell. For purists, I urge you to find a complete copy of this well done film. THe only way you can enjoy something is to see all of it.",
         "This is an example of the type of film where I reckon all the characters act like they know they're in a famous novel. The style and delivery is VERY self-conscious and prosaic, with everyone declaiming their lines in a very \"noble\" fashion (sort of like the \"traditional\" delivery of Shakespeare). C Aubrey Smith is by far the most interesting performer in this story, his irascible nature adding some much-needed bite to the movie. Mickey Rooney is also very memorable, showing once again he was a very dynamic and versatile child actor, handling comic and dramatic scenes very well - even in the same film. The mark of a true consummate performer. I would rank him as a definite child prodigy. (You should also check him out in YOUNG TOM EDISON for another example of this) I actually think the 80s tele-movie with Ricky Shroder and Alec Guiness worked slightly better than this version does; the characters are a lot more casual in their delivery, and the story flows better. But this is a pretty good version on its own terms any rate."
