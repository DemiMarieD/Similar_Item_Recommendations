      "synopsis": "The film begins at Space Station Minos in the year 2127. Paul Merchant, the man who built the station, has a robot solve the Lament Configuration (the robot is subsequently destroyed). However, several guards led by Rimmer capture Paul. Paul tells Rimmer the story of his bloodline. A flashback is shown to around 400 years ago. Philip Lemarchand, a French toymaker, makes the Lament Configuration for a wealthy aristrocrat named Duc de L'Isle, who is obsessed with dark magic. He and his apprentice, Jacques, kill a woman and remove her skin. L'Isle uses dark magic with the Lament Configuration to summon a demon princess named Angelique to inhabit the woman's skin. She is theirs to command unless they stand in Hell's way. However, Angelique and Jacques betray and kill de L'Isle. Lemarchand, in the process of inventing a design (the Elysium Configuration) to destroy the demons, attempts to steal back the box but is discovered. Jacques callously informs the toymaker that he and his bloodline are cursed until the end of time because of the box he created, before ordering Angelique to kill him. However, his wife survives. Around 200 years later, John Merchant has built the building from the last scene of Hellraiser III. Upon realizing that the Merchant bloodline has survived, Angelique turns on Jacques and mutilates him, killing him for \"standing in Hell's way\" and attempts to seduce John. She finds the Lament Configuration in a cement pillar in the basement and makes a man solve it, and he is killed by Pinhead. Pinhead wants to make John use the Elysium Configuration to keep the gateway to Hell open so he can come and go as he pleases. After turning two twin security guards into a two-headed Cenobite, Pinhead tells Angelique that the best way to make John go along with their plans is to threaten his child, Jack. He gets John to use the Elysium Configuration, but it does not work, so Pinhead kills John. John's wife, Bobbi, sends Pinhead, Angelique, and a beastly demon called Chatter Beast back to Hell. Returning to the present, in 2127, Rimmer has Paul locked up. However, he has already summoned the demons: Pinhead, Angelique (now a Cenobite), the Twin Cenobite, and Chatter Beast. One by one, the guards are picked off by Cenobites. Parker is killed by Pinhead, Carducci by Angelique, Chamberlain by Chatter Beast, and Edwards by Twin Cenobite. Rimmer releases Paul, who has a plan to destroy the Cenobites (and built Minos for that specific reason). Rimmer escapes to a space shuttle, and kills Chatter Beast by raising the pressure in a hallway. Paul distracts Pinhead with a hologram while he gets on the shuttle with Rimmer, and activates the Elysium Configuration. A series of powerful lasers and mirrors create a field of perpetual light, while the station transforms and folds around the light to create a massive box. The light is trapped within the box, which then self destructs, destroying the Cenobites and severing the connection between Hell and Earth forever.",

         "In this fourth gripping installment of the Hellraiser series, we are treated to the story of the Lament Configuration (or Lemarchand's Box or whatever you call it). It involves demons, Pinhead, some French people, architecture and outer space. Pretty good deal. This film is my favorite in the Hellraiser series. By itself, there is not much going on. I can understand why many think this film is weak. If I just watched it without the entire series, I would be like, \"what the heck?\" But I think this really ties the first four films together, explaining how everything fits. I have read reviews that say the film is inconsistent and that it does not line up with the other films. I say hogwash. The film makes perfect sense. And it lines up with the others just fine. I guess you could say things like \"how did the box get from x to y\", but I think it is pretty clear. The French guy had it, then it went into circulation, then the Cottons had it in parts 1 and 2, then the news reporter in part 3, and she buried it in the cement where it was pulled out this time. What is not to understand? I could say the space aspect was cheesy. Leprechaun has been to space, and later Jason Voorhees went to space. Others probably did, too, that I cannot think of offhand. But unlike Leprechaun, this made sense... it was actually central to the plot and could not have been done on Earth in any conceivable manner. So the space thing is not so bad. As I mentioned in my review for \"Hellraiser 3\", I dislike how writer Peter Atkins introduced new cenobites. This movie has more, including twins and a former demon (which really makes no sense to me). What determines who becomes a cenobite? Pinhead? Maybe this will be explained in a later film, but probably not, and it is not really explained here. The director disowned this film due to massive re-shoots he had no part in. I, for one, would love to see his version. While I have already said this is my favorite, perhaps the other is something worth checking out. Also, it would stifle some of those critics who think it was reassembled as a senseless pile of bangers and mash. I disagree with those critics and would love to see them eat their words. After seeing parts 1 and 2 (and presumably 3), watch this. Do not listen to the nay-sayers. If you want to know how the whole Pinhead, box and whatnot started, this is the film to explain it to you. (You might ask how Pinhead got out before the box was created, but you would be silly, because he was not born yet.) I support this one and you should, too.",
         "This movie succeeds if you're a fan of Clive Barker's comic book. It follows the mythos quite logically, and adds a good deal of conjecture to the \"reality\" of the cenobites. As a sequel this film fills a void. As a film on its own, this movie should be watched. Its engaging story and thought-provoking plot is enough to keep any viewer entertained, not to mention the violence and gore. Not a bad movie or wasted time.",
         "The year is 2127, and a descendent of the maker of the box that opens the gate to Hell is trying to figure out a way to open the box and trap the demons that come out of Hell. He has commandeered a space station (that he himself designed) for this task. He opens the box, lets the demons out, and is detained (people begin to investigate his questionable behavior on the ship) before he can capture them. Almost the entire film is told in the form of a story which he tells the people holding him, in an effort to get them to let him go so he can finish his work. Needless to say, it takes a lot of gory deaths to convince them. There is a small bit of tension created by the fact that the entire time he is telling the guards what is going on, the Cenobites are out and are on the ship. However, this is largely forgotten about for the majority of the film because so much of it takes place in 18th century France, the time when the box was created. Basically, some toymaker makes the box, opens it, demons show up, and they terrorize his family for generations. You'd think they'd be grateful because he let them out into the world of the living. Anyway, the guy in 2127 has taken upon himself the task of building a NEW box that will be sort of an antidote to the first box, one that is designed so that it can actually trap LIGHT inside. It's an interesting enough story, and it was actually fairly entertaining, but the film itself was still somewhat lacking. The acting was pretty bad (but at least Ashley Laurence was blissfully absent again), and there wasn't much effort put into the directing. The movement back and forth from the distant future to the distant past was also a bit detrimental at times to the tension of the story, but luckily the film did present a few cool new cenobites (one that was satisfactorily created out of a couple of idiot security guards), and Bloodline also displayed probably one of Pinhead's best performances ever. I would say that Bloodline is more of an informational movie than a good Hellraiser movie. While it is interesting to watch, it is almost more informational than entertaining. So even though the movie itself may have been disappointing, I think that it is a good addition to the series as a whole. It works better within the Hellraiser series than it does by itself.",
         "I watched the whole Hellraiser series in a week. I had never seen one before but after seeing the first one i decided to watch the whole series. The first one i just thought was bad but in a funny way. The second was much better. The third was good but not great and then i got to the fourth. All i heard was negative things so i expected crap especially since it was said that it was Pinhead in space. THis movie is not crap! Its actually really good. It might be better then the second one. Good plot. Cool deaths scenes. Good movie.",
         "Every bit as informative and cleverly done as HR3, only this time, the point of interest is that box; that wonderfully treacherous darkly intricate little box. A second definitive film! Hellraiser 3 was the first in the personalization of Pinhead's character. Hellraiser 4: Bloodline gives us the history of the box, the curse upon the family of the one who created it, and the fate of the descendant who created the UN-box; the reverse to the original which will close the gates to Hell for all time. Some critics have given this movie low marks due to the \"Pinhead in Space\" factor, claiming that it was unnecessary and that it lent nothing but cheese to the story. Others have labeled the vehicle as a \"franchise contrivance.\" I must say that I agree with neither statement. Space was the ideal place for this sequence to have occurred. The plot would have suffered greatly had they tried this particular ideology on the Earth's surface. Also, this was a hard movie to make and I found nothing whatsoever contrived about it. It flowed smoothly and told the story beautifully; albeit darkly. This movie also faced some real editing problems while in production. It seems the director had his name removed from this movie (or changed) after scenes depicting a deeper story line and stronger ideologies, were deleted. I give this wonderful installment high marks! Rarely do the sequels even begin to measure up to the original, much less surpass it. It rates an 8.1/10 from... the Fiend :.",
         "I've read the comments of this movie and I agree in most of the observations made. I consider Bloodlines an explanation or \"origin\" of the puzzle box. The first 3 talk about the Cenobites, PinHead and the pleasures and torments the box and the cenobites bring. For me Bloodlines tells the story of the puzzle box and for me as a huge Clive Barker fan it resolves the questions: Where was the puzzle build?, Why was it build? and Who made it? The true Hellraiser movies are 1 and 2, the third one comes like a baseball player sliding in to home plate just inches from being struck out...but it works. And bloodlines totally compliments these, because it's not just about Pinhead, the main character in this one is the Puzzle Box. That's my 2 cents.",
         "Bloodline is easily the best of the post-part III Hellraiser films. Like many third sequels, it takes the path of going back to the series' roots; thus tracing the origins of the central prop; the box that opens the gates to hell. The film starts aboard a space ship, and we witness the seemingly insane ramblings of a madman. He then tells the story of the curse on his bloodline; starting off with the toy maker who made the box and opened the gates to hell. The man plans to create a box to counter the original, and send the demons back to hell. The rest of the more modern sequels follow plots that have nothing to do with the original films, so at least this one doesn't suffer from that. The plot isn't completely relevant to the story of Frank Cotton in the first Hellraiser, but at least it isn't merely another episode of Pinhead taking some guy's soul. On the subject of Pinhead; this film takes place in the time that he was still evil, rather than being a mere shadow of the cenobite that we all know and love. Pinhead plays a major part in this movie, and that's always welcome as far as I'm concerned. Bloodline is more of a fan's movie than the rest of the series. That, therefore, means that if you haven't seen, or didn't like the previous three films; there really isn't much on offer here. Things that have been explained in the first three aren't re-explained here, and therefore it's really important that the other films are seen before this one. Bloodline is surprisingly gruesome, and a lot of the film is very dark and bloody. No bad thing as far as I'm concerned, as I go into Hellraiser films expecting to see gore, and tend to be pleased when they deliver. The acting here is largely terrible, with only Doug Bradley saving the film in that respect. He only does what he's done before - but it really does make the movie. It's surprising how much this deviates from the original; but I'd rather see a sequel do something a little different than merely retread the same ground, as far too many do. That's the reason I aren't slamming this film like a great deal of other's are. It may not be great, and doesn't change the fact that the series dried up after Hellbound...but at least it's not a total dead loss.",
         "Okay, I wasn't going to bother writing a review for this one and I rarely take the time to write reviews here, BUT... Seeing this undeservedly LOW score here made me feel that I really had to 'say' something. First off, YES, I am indeed a BIG fan of the first three films; before these just recently came out on glorious Blu-ray, years ago, I even sprang for the UK Puzzle Box set of the first three films (mainly because at the time UNCUT versions were not available here in the states and also for the full commentaries and the bonus DVD that came with it : ) Now, I know it is hard to believe, but I just NOW for the very first time saw this one, part 4; the reason being is that from casual stuff I had read I was under the impression that pretty much all the other 'HELLRAISER' films were not made very well. Well... Let me tell you, I was extremely surprised (again, as my title above mentions) compared to all the REALLY AWFUL Horror films that are excruciatingly badly made, and that is most of them, I really was truly surprised that this one was made quite well. Okay, so a lot of the fans are sort of put off because it is really different from the other films. Fine... Isn't the POINT to try to come up with different angles and new approaches rather than just remaking the same film again and again...? I thought it was genuinely very creative and kept my attention very much so throughout the film. Sure, okay, it starts in space and your thinking 'LEPRECHAUN 3'; well, it works; it really does. Obviously a LOT of thought was put into the timeline and the mythology of the box, etc., not to mention the follow through at the end. Sure, it wrapped it up rather quickly and left it kind of ambiguous, but so what?! Yes, of COURSE it doesn't have the intensity of the original or even the complexity of the next two films, but to me I was mainly impressed by not only coming up with the new idea to show the origins, etc., but also I honestly felt that everything that made up the film was done very well considering that it is a damn 'HORROR' movie! : ) I gave it a good, strong '8' which it fully deserves considering the context and type of film. I think that people get SO jaded and expect SO dang much from sequels. Hey, like I say... I mean, C'mon, compared to what, 'WITCHBOARD' I-9 or whatever the hell it is, this here is pure art! Heh, if THIS one threw you, just wait until you see part 5! I just this minute finished watching that one for the very first time also a few minutes ago and that is a WILD departure from the early films. However, it was made even much better than this one; the director was actually very, very good!",
         "Oh my! The dreaded space sequel. I must admit, I thought this would bump three out of worst in the series, but I was dead wrong. The one thing I found most appealing about this sequel, is the fact that it leaves room for more sequels, as long as the don't go past the year of Pinhead's final death. Which I may say, they took full advantage of, in making Hellseeker, and Inferno. I think that even though it was good, it still takes a backeat to the original two films. (Part two being my personal fave)",
         "Yes, all lame horror franchises eventually go to space to die, where they re-enact the second Aliens Movie. the plot line here is that an eccentric scientist has hijacked a space station of his own design, and relates to the authorities that in fact, his ancestor created the puzzle box that releases the Cenobites, and that they have spent the last few hundred years tormenting his family. There are three stories within the movie, on in 18th century France, another in Modern America, and the last in space. In this film, Doug Bradley's character of Pinhead starts to take an increasingly subordinate role. (He doesn't actually appear until the second modern story, which is probably accurate, since he was a WWI human before becoming a demon.) Instead, the focus is on a female demon named Angelique, who inhabits the body of a dead prostitute after a foolish nobleman releases her. Except halfway through the movie, she is forgotten and we have the Scientist trapping Pinhead in a dimension where he can only phone it in for the Direct to DVD sequels."

         "It's the year 2127. Pinhead, the evil cenobite of the series, has found himself on board a space station in outer space, run by scientist Dr.Merchant. Dr. Merchant's mission is to close the gates to hell forever. Because his ancestor, a toymaker in the 18th century, built the evil puzzlebox that opens the gates to hell. And through the generations, the family of the bloodline has tried to stop it. But now, Dr.Merchant has built the reverse box. The box that will close the gates to hell instead of opening it.",
         "In the 22nd century, Dr. Paul Merchant has created the ultimate space station for a special purpose: to destroy the Lament Configuration, which has brought silent shame to his family for centuries. In the 18th century, French toy maker Phillip L'Merchant built the first puzzle box, which was used by magician de L'Isle to create a beautiful demon named Angelique, the daughter of Leviathan, the lord of Hell's Labyrinth. As the generations passed, L'Merchant's descendants began the work to create the Elysium Configuration - a box that would destroy the Lament Configuration, until 1996, when one of them, John nearly fell to the power of the box through Angelique. Of course, Pinhead and his Cenobites aren't happy about the fact that the gateway to Hell will by destroyed...",

Spanning several generations, this final entry in Clive Barker's horror franchise acts as both prequel and sequel to the other installments.",
