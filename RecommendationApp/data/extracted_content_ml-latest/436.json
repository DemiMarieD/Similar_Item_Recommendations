         "content": "ust when you thought they'd never make a mystery thriller as deliriously bad as Midnight Lace, just when you imagined that the gold lame spirit of Douglas Sirk had departed forever, comes director Richard Rush's COLOR OF NIGHT to brighten up your dull evenings. Color of Night isn't just bad: it's bad with raisins in it.\r\n \r\n If you were one of the few who saw Color of Night in a theater, you probably remember the plot, but for those millions and millions who missed this gem, let's recap.\r\n \r\nBruce Willis stars as a psychologist. (Are you laughing too hard or can we go on now?) Willis is having a crisis of conscience/ confidence because one of his patients leaped out of a window after applying lots of lipstick. (We all know, don't we, that applying lots of lipstick is a sure sign of suicidal depression?) Anyway, Willis goes out to L.A. to visit fellow shrink Scott Bakula, who takes Willis to his group therapy session so that the fun can start in earnest. Remember \"The Bob Newhart Show\" from the '70's? His group therapy meetings weren't nearly as funny as these: we have a nympho, an obsessive-compulsive, a split personality, the Professor and Mary Ann -- well, you get the idea. Bakula gets killed in a scene that looks like Psycho directed by Mack Sennett. The sad part is that Bakula is the most talented and attractive member of the whole goddamn cast and 30 minutes into the picture he's been bumped off.\r\n\r\nWillis stays on in Bakula's grandiosely modern home (crammed with screamingly bad art) despite the fact that someone keeps stalking him and leaving snakes in the mailbox. (Are hotels in L.A. that expensive?) It's like the TV movie where that devil doll keeps chasing Karen Black around her apartment going, \"Yanni yanni yanni,\" and it never occurs to her to just leave.Instead of ruining the horribly implausible and helter-skelter plot for you, We'll just point out some of the more outrageous lapses of sanity: a) Willis's patient jumps out of a Manhattan office tower, causing pedestrians to scream and run, whereas real New Yorkers would have lifted her purse; b) Three days after famous psychologist Scott Bakula is killed in an exceedingly colorful way in his midtown office, his patients still don't know about it -- okay, we've already established that there are no reasonably priced hotels in L.A., but surely there must be at least one newspaper or TV station; c) The whole plot hook -- Willis goes color blind after seeing his patient's blood -- goes nowhere. Period. You keep thinking there has to be a reason for it or a plot twist that depends on it -- but nothing ever happens.\r\n\r\nThe film is a laugh riot and we don't want to give away all of the jokes. When we saw the film in the theater, the audience laughed all the way through the first sex scene, which took place underwater and was about as erotic as an Esther Williams movie. Oh, yes, we do get to see generous portions of Bruce Willis, though not as much as he'd have liked.\r\nThen there's the acting. Even the extras overact. Keep your eyes out for one unbilled woman playing a hooker in a police station. She only has one line, but she gives it such gusto that she will leave you stunned. Even formerly respected actors lose all sense of self-control; Lesley Ann Warren (decked out in a Shelley Long wig) twitches and twitters like a road company Billie Burke, and Ruben Blades does what appears to be a Jose Jimenez imitation. Willis actually seems like a model of intelligent understatement compared with the rest of the cast, but the truth is, he just wasn't acting at all.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's Jane March. Ever so much of Jane March. Watching her try to match wits with Bruce Willis really makes you appreciate the bang-up job Cybill Shepherd was doing all those years. Jane spends half the movie dressed in disguise as a teenage boy. (How hard is she to spot? She's got teeth like Bucky Beaver! This gal could eat corn on the cob through a picket fence!) It all just gets sillier and sillier until the grand finale, which tried to come off as Hitchcockian but reminded us more of silent film legend Harold Lloyd. Judging by the guffaws from the audience, we weren't alone. So, watch Color of Night if you're feeling down in the mouth. Just don't try to eat popcorn during it -- unless you know the Heimlich maneuver.",

      "synopsis": "Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) is a rich and well-known psychoanalyst in New-York. One day, Michelle (Kathleen Wilhoite), one of his most disturbed patients, gets very angry with him, and when he answers back by telling her to look at herself in the mirror, she commits suicide by jumping from his office window high in a building (compare that to the fall at the beginning of Vertigo which precipitates the phobia in the James Stewart character). The sight of the bloody body of his patient, clad in a bright green dress, causes Capa to suffer, bizarrely, from stress-induced color blindness concerning the color red. The title of the film refers to the fact that, instead of red, he sees only shades of gray. His old friend and mentor, Doctor Larry Ashland (Jeff Corey), tells him it's going to take time, but he would eventually be normal again. To restart his hectic life (he is divorced and has never been able to have another stable relation again), Capa travels to Los Angeles, California, to stay with a friend, fellow therapist and best-selling author Dr. Bob Moore (Scott Bakula). It's a Monday and Moore has his usual group therapy session. He asks Capa to join them. A bit reluctantly, Capa accepts, and meets the members of the group, which are : Clark (Brad Dourif) suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder and insists on cleanliness and counting things. We'll learn later that he can also be violent and he divorced because he beat up his wife. Sondra (Lesley Ann Warren) is a nymphomaniac an a kleptomaniac. We'll learn later that she stabbed her father with a knife and fork and one of her husbands died of unnatural causes. Buck (Lance Henriksen) is an unsociable ex-cop, whose wife and daughter were brutally murdered and the case is still unsolved. Casey (Kevin J. O'Connor) is the arrogant son of a very wealthy man. He paints sado-masochist works of art and he once burnt down his father's house. Richie Dexter is a sixteen-year-old boy with a stutter and a gender identity problem, who would rather be a woman. We'll learn later that he also has a record for drugs. During the session, they all tease each other, and Richie even leaves the room after a small fight with Casey, but he comes back later. After the session, Moore takes his friend to his luxurious house in his luxurious car. The house is heavily protected by all sorts of electronic devices, because Moore has had some anonymous death threats, which he believes come from someone in the Monday group Capa just met. But, a couple of days later, Moore is stabbed to death in his office. Police Detective Lieutenant Hector Martinez (Ruben Blades) suspects one of the patients of the Monday group to be the killer and he asks Capa to tell the Monday group about Moore's death. Next day, as Capa is driving Moore's car, he gets hit by another car, whose driver is a very pretty young girl, Rose (Jane March). As the girl has no insurance, Capa gives her his phone number and address, so they can settle the problem later. Next Monday evening, Capa tells the group about Moore's death. They take it very hard, but they all ask Capa to take over the Monday evening sessions. A couple of days later, Rose comes to Moore's house and Capa takes her to a restaurant. After dinner, on the sidewalk near the restaurant, they start kissing a little, but Rose leaves abruptly in a taxi, without even giving her phone number to Capa. Dale Dexter (Andrew Lowery), Richie's brother, who is about ten years older than him, and who is his official guardian, asks Capa to take Richie out of therapy. But Capa reminds him that, after his legal problems, Richie was sentenced by the court to mandatory treatment, and Capa has to call his probation officer, before he can take a decision. Capa finds a rattlesnake in his mailbox. Fortunately for him, he gets rid of it without being bitten. Then Rose comes to see him and they have sex, first in the swimming-pool, and then in Moore's fancy bedroom. Capa inquires about Richie, and discovers that, when he was twelve, he was treated by a psychiatrist named Dr. Niedelmeyer. Sondra has a girlfriend, Bonnie, whom she keeps talking about. But we discover that Bonnie and Rose, Capa's lover, are the same person. But even though Sondra is a bit disturbed by Sondra flirting with her, she still has sex with her ¬´trainer¬ª, who is a beautiful young male ! Later, Sondra tells Capa that Richie was molested as a child. Capa goes to Dale's workshop. Dale is a very successful wood-sculptor, who makes fancy pieces of furniture, which he sells very well. The workshop itself is a large old disused factory, that still kept its tall chimney. Capa tells Dale that he thinks it is a bit premature to take Richie out of therapy, which doesn't seem to please Dale. Capa pays a visit to Edith Niedelmeyer (Shirley Knight), Dr. Niedelmeyer's widow, but, when he mentions Richie, she slams her door in his face. Another Monday group session. Bill asks them about their current intimate relationships. Sondra mentions her new girlfriend, Casey mentions his new model, Buck mentions the new young girl he has met. Richie says that he only has his brother. Clarks reluctantly admits that he has a new and young girlfriend. Capa is driving around Los Angeles, when he gets chased by a red car with tinted windows, so one cannot see who's inside the car. After he got hit several time by the red car, he finally gets rid of it at a railroad crossing. When Capa gets back to Moore's house, it is to find Rose cooking for him. She explains she stole one of the house key last time she was there. They eat and make love. Next morning, Capa learns from Detective Anderson (Eriq La Salle), one of Martinez's deputies, that Martinez was Buck's deceased wife's lover. Casey gets strangled to death in his painter's workshop. Shortly after the murderer's departure, Capa, who had an appointment with Casey, breaks in his workshop, finds the corpse, and also some paintings burning in the fireplace. A face on one of the half-burned paintings looks a bit like Rose. Later, Rose comes to Capa's place. They start looking at Moore's photo albums, when Rose abruptly stops him and goes outside to sunbathe in the garden. While Capa pretends to be is in the shower, Rose takes some pictures out of the photo album, and runs away in her car. Capa tries to run after her, but looses her. Later in the evening, it is the Monday group session. Clark, who counts everything, notices that one art book, which was missing a week before, is now back in place. Capa, who understands that kleptomaniac Sondra stole it, asks her to show him the book. Actually it is Moore's diary hidden inside an art book cover. In the diary, Capa finds a picture of Rose naked. Everyone in the group recognizes Rose as being his or her own girlfriend. Richie looks at the picture and leaves the room. Capa gives Detective Anderson the license number of Rose's car and asks him to find the owner of the car. As Capa walks near a car-parking building, the red car with the tinted windows pushes another car from the top of the builiding, and the falling car misses Capa by a few inches. Detective Anderson gives the name of the owner of Rose's car to his boss, Lieutenant Martinez. CAUTION : THE FOLLOWING SECTION CONTAINS IMPORTANT SPOILERS. DO NOT READ IT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM. Mrs Niedelmeyer reluctantly tells Capa that Richie Dexter killed himself four years ago, because her husband, Richie's psychiatrist, molested him. Capa rushes to Dale's workshop, where he finds Richie in a bloody mess. He takes off Richie's wig and glasses, and Rose appears. She explained that, after Richie's suicide, her big brother Dale forced her to dress like Richie, and look like Richie, and then he molested her. After Rose, impersonating Richie, got busted and had to go to the therapy group, she started to feel she wanted to be a girl again. But she didn't dare, at first, to be Rose, so she was Bonnie. She started to be Rose again when she fell in love with Capa. When Capa wants to take Rose away, he discovers that she has been nailed to her chair by Dale ! He takes the nails off. But Dale comes back and starts shooting them with his nail-gun. He nails Capa's shirt on the wall. He wants to kill him when Lt Martinez walks in and points his real gun at him. But Dale is faster than Martinez and nails both of his hands on the wall. Capa and Rose run away, but Dale, using a big power machine, makes several shelves fall on them. Rose escapes but Dale catches Capa and ties him inside a metal cage. Dale explains Capa that he killed Moore, because Moore was beginning to understand who Richie really was. And he killed Casey because Casey, with his painter's eyes, was beginning to understand that ¬´Bonnie¬ª and Richie were the same person. Dale starts an electric saw to ¬´cut Capa into little pieces¬ª, when Rose shoots the nail-gun at him and kills him. After she has killed her brother, Rose wants to kill herself, but fortunately, the nail-gun stops working. She runs to the high chimney towering above the building, and starts climbing it. When she reaches the platform at the top of the chimney, she wants to jump down from it, but Capa catches her and puts her back on the platform, where they start kissing each other very passionately. There is a red beacon flashing in the background and suddenly, Capa can see the real red color of the beacon : he has been cured from his color-blindness by love ! Capa and Rose keep on kissing passionately on the platfom while Martinez is yelling for them to come and unnail him !",

         "There's a good film in here somewhere just aching to get out, but the filmmakers seem more interested in playing Box Office Wheel of Fortune than caring about the quality of the product they're trying to sell, and it makes `Color of Night,' directed by Richard Rush, one of those movies that makes you shake your head and think, Ah! what could have been if only! And that single `if' makes all the difference in the world with regards to what finally winds up on the screen. When his treatment of a patient fails and ends tragically, leaving him with some pronounced psychological damage of his own, New York psychologist Dr. Bill Capa (Bruce Willis) quits his practice and goes to Los Angeles seeking the solace and, perhaps, the help of an old friend and colleague, Dr. Bob Moore (Scott Bakula). Capa quickly discovers, however, that Moore is having problems of his own, apparently stemming from a weekly group therapy session he has been conducting for some time. Moore, it seems, has recently received some death threats, which he believes are coming from one of the patients of this particular group, though he hasn't a clue which one, nor any proof of his suspicions. Moore invites Capa to sit in on the next group session, hoping for a fresh perspective and possibly some insights into the matter. At the moment, Capa feels incapable of actively engaging in the practice of his chosen field of endeavor, but in light of the fact that he's Bob's house guest, he acquiesces and agrees to observe the group. But it proves to be an inauspicious proposition for all concerned, and subsequent circumstances quickly put Capa at the center of just the kind of situation he left New York to avoid. Once the hand is dealt, however, he has no choice but to play it out to the end. Rush began his career as a director with low budget exploitation films like `Too Soon to Love' in 1960, and ten films later achieved legitimate status with the highly successful black comedy, `The Stunt Man' in 1980, for which he received an Oscar nomination (along with his leading man, Peter O'Toole). He did not direct again until this film, some fourteen years later, and during that hiatus, Rush apparently lost whatever expertise he had accrued by 1980, and his `roots' are clearly showing in this one. The violence of the film is inherent in the story, but Rush makes it unnecessarily graphic; and while this could have been an incisive and insightful character study (and intrinsically more interesting), he takes the low road, fleshing it out instead with scenes of gratuitous sex and nudity, as well as superfluous action (he works in no less than two ridiculous car chases, one culminating in a vehicle being pushed from the top of a high rise parking garage). Furthermore, he ignores motivations and character development almost entirely; the two areas that required the most attention if this film was going to work at all. Rush especially lets his actors down, inasmuch as most of these characters presented real challenges that could have been met much more successfully with the help and guidance of the director. Rush would have served his actors, as well as himself, better had he taken the time to explore these people being portrayed with some depth. He apparently did not, however, and with one exception the performances by one and all suffer for it. In 1994, Bruce Willis simply was not the accomplished actor he is today, and he, especially, could have used some help in finding his character. it was help he obviously did not get, and his Capa ends up being too much John McClane and not enough Malcom Crowe. Willis flounders between the two personalities, creating a kind of schizophrenic characterization that seriously affects the credibility of his portrayal. And it's the same fate suffered by Scott Bakula here. Even in the scenes which places them in their `professional' setting as psychoanalysts, they are simply not convincing. Making the case of poor directing even stronger are the performances of Lesley Ann Warren (Sondra), Brad Dourif (Clark), Ruben Blades (Lt. Martinez) and Kevin J. O'Connor (Casey). Like Willis, all of them seem to have trouble defining their individual characters, vacillating between any number of personalities and unable to achieve that necessary, final focus. It's the kind of indecisiveness that is usually resolved during rehearsals, but inexplicably made it to the screen here. The single exception is the performance turned in by Lance Henriksen, as Buck, who unlike his costars, somehow managed to find his character and make him convincing. The odd-'woman'-out of the entire bunch is Jane March, who as Rose has perhaps the most challenging role of all, and when given the opportunity actually displays some talent. Unfortunately, Rush-- for the most part-- uses her in a way that is demeaning and without merit, and she becomes the object of a sleight-of-hand that is nothing more than a cheap trick Rush pulls out of his hat. And by failing to use her in a more productive way, by not concentrating on developing her character (which is so vital to the story), Rush commits his most critical error of all. The supporting cast includes Eriq La Salle (Detective Anderson), Jeff Corey (Ashland), Kathleen Wilhoite (Michelle), Shirley Knight (Edith Niedelmeyer), John Bower (Medical Examiner) and Andrew Lowrey (Dale Dexter). The high note of this entire project was played before it ever even got off the ground, that being the story itself; but screenwriters Matthew Chapman and Billy Ray proceeded to methodically remove any and all credibility it may have initially contained, and Rush took it from there, taking `Color of Night' straight into that black hole reserved for movies that fail to deliver on their promise. It is not surprising that Rush has not directed a feature film since this one; once the magic is lost, it's hard to retrieve. 2/10.",
         "As I sit and recall all the idiocies of this film, one of the most amusing that I remember is the idea put forth that a person with DID will disguise themselves to look like a different person when one of their alternates come out. In nearly eleven years of knowingly watching these patients switch from personality to personality, I have yet to see this happen. This is before we even get into the fact that Jane March's behaviour during this film more closely resembles that of a person suffering mania - hypersexuality, paranoia, irrational fear, and so forth. Bruce Willis must also be wondering why he signed up for this stinker. I'm sure the shooting script must have looked wonderful, but a combination of extremely clumsy editing (the sex scenes in the middle of the film are a wonderful example) and poor character development turned this into another Plan 9 From Outer Space. To all of you who gave this turkey positive comments, I ask you to ask yourselves: what psychiatrist in their right mind would see patients in buildings where it is that easy for patients to off themselves? Especially in such a lawsuit-happy society as America? What psychiatrist in their right mind stays back late in their office without carrying a firearm when they know someone is stalking them? Finally, when was the last time you heard of a psychiatrist taking over a group of patients for a friend in the profession when one of them might have murdered him? Oh, and a special note on Ruben Blades' role: even beat police are not that ignorant about psychiatry, an especially important element of their job considering how often they may be confronted by psych patients waving weapons in the middle of an episodic crisis. As a veteran of numerous therapy groups, I could not stop laughing at this film. If it had been approached with the intention of making a comedy, then it would have succeeded beyond all expectations. However, the advertising campaign and the babbling tone of the dialogue left me with the general feeling that this film was taking itself WAY too seriously. If you do take yourself that seriously, get a better script. If you have such a ridiculous script that will get laughed at by the 20% that will experience some form of psychiatric problem in their lifetime (that's just a statistical fact based on reported cases... the real incidence may actually be higher), don't take yourself so seriously. It's that simple.",
         "Most people that comment here take the film and story serious as if it has to have taken place or something, to begin with! Look, I saw this film late at night and as a big Bruce Willis fan I liked it. And believe me, I'm not a moron, there's nothing wrong with me. I just liked this film, it was good entertainment (just what a film is supposed to do), good thrilling, (just what a thriller should do!) and good acting. Nice of Brad Dourif to drop by in this film, I remembered him from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Billy) immediately. Now for the story, I think character building was adequate. Of course you must not think too much. No psychiatrist would visit their patients at home and there is more that doesn't add up, but never the less, I was surprised with the end. People are getting killed and the killer is out there, really close to the main character. You really don't know who did it, all though you have your hunches. And that makes a thriller worth while, I think. And about eroticism, this film has stuff for him and her. Bruce really looks great in jeans and you get to see him naked here! And Jane March is stunning, also naked. Beautiful sex-scenes and nicely edited. The film has a nice chase too, a Mercedes SL against a Camaro or Trans Am. Advice: see this film and judge for yourself! (and write it down here!) Switch your senses off and just let yourself be entertained. You'll see, you'll like it!",
         "Now, I know this is not even close to being Willis's best movie or role. I still thought this was a decent thriller. A good supporting cast with Brad Dourif(voice of Chucky, the best Horror icon ever!) & Lance Henriksen(who will star in just about anything these days) just to name a few. I can understand why Jane March hasnt done much, she'll be type-cast as woman who takes clothes off alot. & yeah, this is as close to a porn flick as you can get, when it comes to big named actors in studio movies. In my opinion, there are worse movies with Bruce Willis. This is worth seeing if you're in the mood for a adult-orientated suspense thriller...with quite alot of sex. & yes, ladies, You can see Bruce's winky in this too.",
         "I loved this movie! Willis and March are simply excellent. This is a movie that you'll want to watch again and again. I think this flick was highly under rated! The sexual energy between Bruce Willis and Jane March is amazing. However, it's the tiny nuances which really made the film fun to re-watch.",
         "The director's cut, no pun intended, seems to be a much better film than the one that was shown commercially, but it still is a far cry from a satisfactory movie to watch. Richard Rush could have done better, but the psychological film we see, adds nothing to what has already been shown before. From the beginning we realize who the killer is, as well as the person with the multiple personality problem. It's too obvious! The film relies heavily on the sexual attraction between Bill Capa and Rose. Much has been speculated in this forum about whether we are actually seeing Willis' willis, or not. Since most male stars wouldn't be caught dead showing their genitals, for obvious reasons, what is seen for a second in the pool scene is that of a body double. On the other hand, we see Jane March showing it all, which is a welcome attraction. Only the final sequence has any impact. There are many things in the plot that don't add up and the viewer is ahead of the story at all times. Bruce Willis with a hairpiece looks good. Jane March has a better chance with the character she plays. Also Brad Dourif, Lance Henriksen have their moments. The one that doesn't come across well is Ruben Blades, an otherwise excellent actor trying to do a Columbo routine in this film.",
         "Knowing nothing about this movie before I saw it, I have to admit that it surprised me with its plot-twists...but looking back, I should have known better! That's the great thing about trashy movies: you can have a high time while it's playing, knowing you'll hate yourself the next day (and that you'll never have to watch the thing again). Bruce Willis is a psychiatrist troubled by a patient's suicide; he goes to stay with a friend and...to give any more away would be criminal! Suffice it to say, Bruce is nude in this one, and it's a long-held sequence that gives star-peepers what they've paid for. I didn't think the sex scenes were terrifically charged, but you gotta hand it to Willis: he takes a chance here and shows his courage. Yet there are times when he has question marks all over his face, as if to ask, \"what's a nice box-office star like me doing in a piece like this?\" ** from ****",
         "This film isn't nearly as bad as IMDb users made me think it was. Yes, there were a couple of fairly ludicrous things late in the movie, such as climbing the tower for no apparent reason, (but remember, that character was a loon) and especially the red Firebird on the top of the parking garage. I have an idea why these things were forced into the movie. Probably just because someone (Rush?) thought it would be cool to photograph. It's sort of like porn, where the most common positions aren't done to reflect real life, or because they are particularly erotic, or even comfortable, but because they provide the best camera angle. Aside from the last twenty minutes or so, the film was pretty good. Jane March being naked a lot helped, of course. It is odd that Willis' character didn't recognize her in her Bonnie persona while walking past her, she didn't look that different. However, I wouldn't have caught on that she was Richie, also. (NOTE: This is NOT a spoiler, because March is listed as all those characters in the cast list on IMDb, which I saw before viewing the movie.) The film has elements of many different genres, and could be thought of as a psychological thriller, an action movie, a dreamy love story, and a regular murder mystery. Bruce Willis turned in a good performance. As much as I try to dislike his smarmy, perpetual smirk, he has a certain charisma as an actor that I cannot deny. In spite of its flaws, this film is worth a look. Grade: B",
         "Looking at the other reviews, this film is like marmite - you either like it or hate it! I liked it quite a lot. Bruce Willis is quite enjoyable - you could compare it to The Sixth Sense - he's a therapist in that one too. It's the kind of film where there are preposterous moments that make you smile, but there's enough good acting to outweigh that. Is it 'so bad, it's good'? - Yes at times it falls into that category - especially in the closing scenes. However, lots of credit to Jane March... call me slow on the uptake if you like, but I had no inkling that Ritchie/Rose are the same actress till the end. One thing that lets it down is the music - fairly corny at times, could have been much improved with a more original score. I think Dale should have risen one more time from the dead, to make it a truly 'so bad it's good' film!",
         "Anyone who wants to see how not to make an erotic-thriller would be wise to rent this movie (and possibly Sliver). Everything about this movie sucks: the acting, directing, script and sex-scenes are so stupid and horrendously staged that it's a wonder that this movie even made into theaters (it has direct-to-video fodder written all over it.) WARNING-SPOILERS: The movie stars a hilariously wooden Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist who after witnessing one of his patients dive out of his office window, loses the ability to see the color red(!). He decides to go out to see his friend Scott Bakula who works with a group of people who have had something traumatic happen in their life and are having trouble making the rebound. Not too long after he arrives people around him start getting killed off and he also meets a beautiful yet mysterious young woman played by the gorgeous Jane March. Actually, the only reason I could see recommending this piece of junk to anyone is strictly for the scenes where Ms. March is nude. She really is quite spectacular with no clothes on! The much touted sex-scenes are really bad. They try to be really explicit but come across as just forced or really goofy. The film also contains some of the most ridiculous plot twists that I've ever had the misfortune of watching. By the time the movie ended I felt like I had had my brain ripped out of my skull, dribbled like a basketball, nuked in the microwave for a couple of minutes and then put sloppily back in my head. Yes, this movie really is that bad. And probably the greatest mistake this film makes is that it can't even be enjoyed on a guilty pleasure so-bad-it's-good level. \"Color of Night\" is rated R and contains strong sexual content, nudity, graphic violence and strong language. rating:1"
