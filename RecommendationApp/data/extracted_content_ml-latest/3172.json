         "According to Homer, Ulysses is king of Ithaca, and father, by his wife, Penelope, of Telemachus... Homer portrays Ulysses as a man of outstanding wisdom, eloquence, resourcefulness, courage and endurance... In the Iliad, Ulysses appears as the man best fitted to cope with crises in personal relations among the Greeks and his bravery and skill in fighting were demonstrated repeatedly... Ulysses wanderings and the recovery of his house and kingdom are the central theme of our film, which also relates how he accomplishes the capture of Troy by means of the wooden horse... The motion picture, fill in the gaps with flashbacks, describes Ulysses' wanderings between Troy and Ithaca... As a troubled man, Ulysses spends much time at the shore trying to remember his past... He encounters Polyphemus, the Cyclops, son of Poseidon... He escapes from his cave by getting him drunk and running a ram into his eye... Shipwrecked, his men gone, his memory lost, he is discovered by a beautiful young princess Nausicca (Rossana Podesta) who immediately falls in love with him... Ulysses defeats the champion wrestler of Phaeacia in a public exhibition, but remains distant trying to recall his past... He then encounters the Sirens whose songs lure sailors to their death... Plugging the ears of his men with wax, he has himself tied to the mast with ropes so that he can hear their call... Ulysses reaches the island of the enchantress Circe who casts her spell on him... Taking on the appearance of his wife Penelope, she held him captive and turned his crew into swine, but fails to keep him in her company... After almost l0 years, Ulysses at last arrived in Ithaca, where his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, had been struggling to maintain their authority during his prolonged absence... Kirk Douglas plays, with sensitivity, Ulysses, \"the man of many turns\" who had many opportunities of displaying his talent for ruses and deceptions; but at the same time, his courage and loyalty.. The full-figured Silvana Mangano plays a double role: Penelope, the faithful wife and Circe, the sorceress... Anthony Quinn is the arrogant Antinous, the most persistent of Penelope's suitors, hanging around the palace with a group of vicious noblemen, trying to persuade the lovely queen that Ulysses is dead and that she should choose one of them as her next husband.. With the elements of an Italian epic adventure tale photographed in Technicolor, the film is quite entertaining in its attempts to translate episodes of Homer's Odyssey...",
         "I too first saw this movie when I was in my very early teens and still at school, but unlike my movie buff friend who wrote the first comment, I enjoyed this film when I saw it again many years later and still do some half a century after the first time. Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn are excellent in their lead roles as one can imagine by their chequered careers, nevertheless I find Rossana Podesta' and Silvana Mangano very good on the eyes but rather pedestrian in their interpretations of the \"forgotten women\". I doubt a man like Ulysses would fall for such a verveless Circe. Young Franco Interlenghi plays a suitable youthful Telemachus. The scenes with Polyphemus are good and the overall photography quite stunning. The final scenes when Ulysses rids his house of the unwanted suitors is very violent and gory but well performed. Unfortunately the English dialogue is dubbed and at times this is quite obvious, but after all this was an Italian production (I first saw it in the original language with my late father).",
         "Kirk Douglas entered the sand and sandal genre six years before his acclaimed Spartacus with this version of Ulysses and his long voyage home from the wars of Troy. If you'll remember your classical history, and the recent movie Troy, Ulysses was the guy who finally broke the siege at Troy with that wooden horse gambit. But as the Greeks ran amuck in Troy, behaving very much like barbarians, Cassandra the high priestess of Poseidon, called on the big guy to do his very worst to Ulysses. Of course in the film Poseidon is called by his Roman name of Neptune. As Ulysses, Kirk Douglas invests the part with his own combination of aggressiveness and charm. It ain't exactly the classics, but realize that the film was aimed at a juvenile market and it works out rather well. Even the grownups will get a good hearty laugh at how the clever Ulysses outwits the Cyclops. Silvana Mangano does very well as the long suffering Penelope, the wife of Ulysses who's needs just aren't being met and as Circe the witch whose profession kind of scares the guys away. Anthony Quinn has a small role as one of Penelope's suitors for the hand of the presumed widow. Why he took such a small part in a film I'm not quite sure, but this would be the first of three films he did with Kirk Douglas. The next one, Lust for Life would gain Quinn a second Oscar. Ulysses is not one of Kirk Douglas's greatest roles, but the film still holds up well today and kids and grownups will appreciate it.",
         "I enjoyed it very much. I assume this was the earliest of the bunch of muscleman films that became increasingly popular with the release of the Hercules with Steve Reeves. It starts out a bit slow, but Ulysses' voyage is done wonderfully. The highlight of course is the cyclops that takes him and his men prisoner. The effects are well done, as is the cyclops make-up. Kirk Douglas makes a good Ulysses and Silvana Mangano is beautiful as his wife Penelope and seductive in the second role of the witch, Circe. If you enjoy these kinds of films, this is one of the good ones.",
         "Odysseus' journey told in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. After fighting in the Trojan War, Odysseus spends years trying to return home to Itaka. This is the story of a man who left his home , his wife and his son to go away to war.. He destroyed the city of his enemies and started back home . But Neptune , protector God of the conquered people , pursued him with his anger and kept him murdering for ten years . It is the story of Ulysses who dared defy the god and continued his journey to Ithaca , his home, where his wife Penelope was waiting.. and waiting.. The dust of centuries has not dimmed the glories of Ulysses' heroic deeds. the cave of Pholiphemus still reverberates with the with the bellowing roars of the son of Neptuno . The sorrowful face of Penelope still gazes longingly across the open sea. And on a distant shore Circe still casts her spill . For the immortality that Ulysses refused of a goddess was later given to him by a poet ..And the epic poem that Homer sang of the hero's wanderings and of his yearning for home will live for all time . Good rendition deals with Ulysses on his Odyssey home to Penelope and Telemaco after the Trojan War . The classic version ever of Homer's epic produced by two greatest Italian producers as Carlo Ponti and Dino De Laurentis . Based on Homer's Odyssey adapted by seven writers ,including the American prestigious Irwin Shaw and Ben Hecht , Billy Wilder's usual. As a tale , the Odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a man's life. The cast is brilliant and international with American as Kirk Douglas , Anthony Quinn and Italian actors as Silvana Mangano , Rossana Podesta and Franco Interlenghi. Silvana Mangano gives us a typical Greek tragedy style performance in a double role as Penelope and Circe , but most amazing is Kirk Douglas acting as the brave and valiant Ulysses , really good looking , impulsive and totally convincing, it seems the role was really written for him . Partially shot in natural locations in the Mediterranean and Ponti-Laurentis studios. The exteriors of this Lux motion picture were filmed on the Mediterranean coast and islands described in Homer's Odyssey . The sea and the sky are strikingly blue, the islands green and wild . Colorful and spectacular cinematography by Harold Rosson . Evocative and impressive original score by Alessandro Cicognini , well conducted by Franco Ferrara . The motion picture is professionally directed by Mario Camerini and some scenes by Mario Bava though uncredited . Rating : Better than average take on that will appeal to classic film lovers and Kirk Doglas fans . Another excellent adaptation results to be ¨L'Odissea¨ (1968) TVseries directed by Franco Rossi and also by Mario Bava with Bekim Fehmiu as Ulysses and Irene Papas as Penelope.",
         "Homer's tale goes that after his brilliant idea of a huge wooden horse that decided the Greek's victory in the Troyan war, Ithaca's King Ulysses challenged the sea god Poseidon and he was punished to sail around for 10 years before he could get back to his island and his faithful wife Queen Penelope. During the hero's long absence many ambitious men have settled in his palace with the intention of marrying the supposedly widow Queen and rule Ithaca with her. The picture is about Ulysses's trip and all the tasks he has to go through before reaching home and, once there, how he deals with the men that are trying to take his place. Though the film is sort of slow by the middle part of the story and perhaps a little exceeded in its running time, it doesn't lack adventure, action and entertainment. Ulysses faces the cyclops who wants to have him and his crew for lunch, survives the seducing singing of the mermaids, visits the kingdom of the dead and escapes the spell of sorceress Circe who plans to retain him for herself. Arrived at last in Ithaca after loosing all his mates, he faces the pretenders to his throne in a memorable action and fighting sequence. \"Ulysses\" is pure entertainment and adventure in ancient Greece. The film is well done and easy to watch (its excess in duration apart)with a correct direction by Mario Camerini. It shows well chosen locations and carefully designed settings. Special effects are more than acceptable for 1955. But perhaps the main feature is a well selected main cast. Kirk Douglas is the perfect choice for Ulysses and his performance is strong and convincing. Silvana Mangano renders a believable Penelope and Anthony Quinn is at his best playing the main pretender Antinoos (\"the first in pride\"). It could be true that this picture inspired the sword and sandals sub genre that started a bit later with Steve Reeves's \"Hercules\", but you can be sure that fortunately this one doesn't belong to that category. A fine product in its genre.",
         "Any history class which desires to imbue students with imagination, needs this film in their library on Ancient Greece. In 1955 this movie on the wanderings of the Trojan Hero \"Ulysses\" made it's way across the country. In the professional opinion of many a history teacher, this movie fell far short of being historically accurate, but in it's basic rendition of Homer's classical, it proved a masterpiece. In this version, fans saw the Greek Ithican King as portrayed by Kirk Douglas. For his fans it was a perfect role and one which convinced us, he was indeed a true thespian. Through his legendary encounters with the Titan, Polythemeus, The Sirens of the rocks, and of course, Circe, the witch, he is pitted against all the ancient Gods. But it is his final challenge by the suitors who wish to claim his wife and throne, which is his greatest threat, for they are led by the champion Antinoos (Anthony Quinn), from the island of Encephelonea. Only through a special contest and with the help of Athena, can he regain his kingdom, his wife and his son. This is a classic in its own right and like our hero, has never been equaled. ****",
         "Fun to watch, do not be to hard on the special effects it was 1954 after all! Fun to see such a young Anthony Quinn. Who played Cyclops? Does it matter?",
         "I saw this film when I was seven,(1962), I was an epic then and will remain an epic thru eternity. Good strong Italian cast, camera angles and cinematography were cutting edge for that time,(52),Ulysses,(Kirk Douglas), has been away from home on a quest of war and exploration for ten years, and his wife fears he has died in the wars, with her heart broken and her friends and family giving advice to move on with her life, plus the towns political figures trying to pursue her \"late\" husbands fortune in the guise of suitors, Ulysses wife devises a contest, with the winner taking all including her hand in marriage. All one must do is string Ulysses bow and shoot an arrow thru a multitude of axe heads eyes to meet it's destination at a bullseye at the other end, (without touching the eyelets of the axe handles). What happens at the event is a climax worth waiting for, for thirty-eight years, as that's how long I've waited for it to be released on video/DVD. Release date: 1/1/2000. I rate it a ten!",
         "I've recently viewed this film on video, and though I found it to be a much better than the awful 1998 TV movie, it still lacks an accurate portrayal of the main characters. Ulysses(Odysseus)is cunning, clever, ever testing those around him including his wife and son. He never reveals his true identity until he is certain he can trust the various characters he meets throughout his journey. For instance, in the English translation by Kennedy, Ulysses washes up on shore and feigns memory loss until he knows his hosts can be trusted. This is a display of his clever nature. However, in this version, Kirk Douglas portrays him as actually having lost his memory. There is very little of his clever nature portrayed anywhere in the film. Also missing from this version is a portrayal of the goddess Athena who is so important to Homer's epic. Will there ever be a faithful version of this classic story?"
