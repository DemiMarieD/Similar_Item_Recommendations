      "synopsis": "In 1863, Confederate soldiers are carrying a gold bullion as a payday for the army. Suddenly, they are cornered and shot by a highwayman using anachronistic automatic pistols and futuristic tech equipment, leaving them stranded and dead. The mysterious highwayman steals the trunk containing the gold and then suddenly vaporizes into a gelitan like mist. In 1994, 131 years later, the U.S. government creates the Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) to combat the misuse of newly developed time travel technology. They have discovered that the same gold bullion was used in recent arms purchases. The TEC is to detect \"time ripples\" among the timelines and to stop them from happening before they reach the present, since people cannot travel forward in time to the future, they always travel back to either change history or steal riches.(Note: the mysterious highwayman who killed the Confederate soldiers to steal their gold is never revealed or idenitifed). Senator Aaron McComb (Ron Silver) volunteers to oversee the commission. Meanwhile, police officer Max Walker (Jean Claude Van Damme) is offered a job as a TEC agent. He meets his wife Melissa (Mia Sara) at a local shopping mall where he stops a purse snatcher. He notices three odd-looking punk men following them despite never seeing them before. Walker and Melissa go home to their large fancy house and later have sex. Later that same evening, Max is attacked in his home by the same intruders he saw earler at the mall and Melissa is killed in an explosion, destroying his house. Ten years later in the year 2004, Walker is now a veteran TEC Agent. He is sent back to October 1929, in the midst of the Wall Street crash to arrest his former partner Atwood (Jason Schombing) for taking advantage of the U.S. stock-market crash. After subduing Atwood's bodyguards, Walker interrogates Atwood who reveals that he is working for Senator McComb, who needs money for his presidential campaign. Terrified by McComb's threat to murder his ancestors, thereby wiping out his existence, Atwood tries to kill himself by jumping out a window. Walker catches him as he falls and takes him back to 2004, but Atwood refuses to testify against McComb and the TEC agency sends him back to 1929, right where he left off, this time falling to his death. Senator McComb arrives at the TEC agency to oversee the work and to congragulate Walker for his recent sucessfull mission. Walker implies to McComb that he knows all about his dirty dealings behind the scenes in Washington and about his means to aquire money for his campaign. McComb leaves the facility and orders his aide to have Walker killed. The next morning, two assasins break into Walker's small apartment and attempt to kill him, but Walker, a trained marial arts expert, kills both assasins after a violent and protracted fight. While still trying to investiage McComb to expose him of corruption, Walker is partnered with agent Sarah Fielding (Gloria Reuben), and sent back to 1994 to investigate a pending ripple, where they find a young Senator McComb arguing with his business partner Jack Parker about their company's new computer chip. Parker offers to buy McComb's share of the company, but suddenly, the older McComb arrives from 2004 to warn his younger self that the chip will make huge profits. A fight starts when Walker is double-crossed by Fielding, who reveals she works for McComb. McComb kills Parker, wounds Fielding, attempts to kill Walker, and manages to escape back to 2004. When Walker returns to 2004, he finds that things have become worse. McComb now owns the computer company, with no record of Parker. He is almost guaranteed the Presidency with his finances and approval rating. The TEC is being shut down due to budget cuts. There is also no record of Fielding. Realizing that he has to fix things, Walker hijacks the original prototype time machine (which McComb had been using for their illegal trips) with the help of Commander Matuzak (Bruce McGill), who sacrifices himself when McComb's men try to stop Walker from escaping. Finding himself once more in 1994, Walker finds Fielding in the hospital, where she agrees to testify against McComb. Whilst trying to find Fielding's DNA from a blood sample in the lab, Walker finds a sample of Melissa's blood and it indicates she is pregnant. Walker realizes her death occurred later that night, and he decides to stop it. After going back to Fielding's room, he discovers that she has been murdered and he is framed as the prime suspect. He goes to the mall where he and Melissa met that night. Eventually Max finds her and manages to convince her he is from the future. He also sees the three thugs who attacked him and realizes that they are McComb's men whom were sent back to kill him before he joined the TEC. That evening, McComb's thugs break into Walker's home, like before, only this time the older Walker is waiting for them. Without his younger self realizing it, the older Walker helps to fight off the bad guys. Together, they and Melissa win, though the younger Walker is wounded. The 2004 McComb then takes Melissa hostage. When the older Walker finds the older McComb is holding Melissa, the younger McComb sets a time bomb. He then shoots Melissa, just before the young McComb appears, having been tricked by a fake message from Walker. Walker grabs the young McComb and pushes him into the older one, causing them to become a writhing, screaming mass which melts into nothingness (since according to the time theory, no two persons can exist by physically touching each other). Walker carries the wounded Melissa out of the house just before the bomb explodes, destroying the house just like before. Walker returns to 2004, and the timeline has been corrected. The TEC still exists, Fielding and Matuzak are alive, and McComb does not exist, having \"vanished\" ten years earlier. As Walker returns home, he is happily shocked to find himself living in the same house which was rebuilt. Melissa is alive and their 9-year-old son is waiting to greet him. Melissa has something to announce to Walker, implying that she is pregnant again.",

         "A few reviewers here need to chill out. 'Tis true, Hyams is no Kubrick, even an infusion of the great man's DNA wouldn't guarantee his next flick would rise above plebian mediocrity. So what? Does Hyams aspire to creative brilliance? or does he just make films at his own pace and at his own level of artistic creativity, which after all is his right to do. If there are those who look down from their own lofty pedestals frowning upon what they see as ungilded simplicity well - whoopy do, go shoot your own celestial Heart of Darkness - make your point that way! For my money, TIMECOP achieved exactly what it set out to achieve...value for your $12.95 whatever. Certainly no cerebral rush, but honest entertainment nonetheless. I rather doubt the Van Damme brigade were looking for some kinda kick-ass Yoda with nunchukas. Hyams delivered his requisite quota of high kicks per dollar and exploding blood capsules per reel. The imdb rating for this film is laughable...it rates a minimum of 6.6!",
         "I thought this was a notch above the normal no-brainer kick-boxer action flicks which star men like Jean-Claude VanDamme, Steven Segal, Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan, etc. because of the interesting and somewhat complex tale with time travel as the main theme. The story also has some good twists and humor. THE GOOD - Kudos to the four s's in here: Silver, suspense, special-effects and sound - all of them are very good. There is something about Ron Silver's looks that spell \"sleazy and rotten\" before he even opens his mouth! When he speaks, his accent and profanity quickly verifies those suspicions. The special- effects - at least when this came out in the mid '90s - were very cool when the time travelers reached their destinations and appear out of this wall of near- transparent plastic. The story can be a bit confusing at times but is fun at most times, especially near the end when doubles of all the characters are on the screen at once THE BAD - The bad part of the film is the credibility, especially with Silver who plays a politician. No politician, no matter what party or where, would be this much of low-life. In fact, the story is full of unlikable and untrustworthy characters, too many of them. There also is too much Rambo-mentality and the final action goes on way too long. The time travel ange of the story may be intelligent but the dialog in this movie is just plain dumb and too juvenile. Overall, this is one of the best of a small group of well-done Van Damme movies.",
         "Timecop is probably remembered as his last good movie before he got into a rut of mediocre(though successful) action flicks.Its also the most mainstream picture he was ever in for my money. In 1994 Time-travel has become a possible reality.Washington decides that it needs to be \"policed\" from criminal activity and the paradox's of undoing life as we know it.Cut to 2004:Enter Van Damme as Walker the on-the-rocks time-cop who uncovers a plot to swindle the presidency by a corrupt Senator McComb played by Ron Silver,who actually engineered the murder of Walkers-wife(Mia Sara).Can Max stop McComb?Can he go back and save his wife?After some decent gunfights and roundhouses you'll have to find out. Timecop benefits from having a talented director Like Peter Hyams behind the wheel for this one.He stages everything well,Keeps the action and plot flowing,Special FX are engaging,and gets a very good performance by Van Damme.Who comes off vulnerable and like a real person.The production values are very good here too.It is also pretty decent political backdrop/Sci-fi combo. Ron Silver is a great Bad Guy here as McComb.He gets to shoot, beat people up,Snarls And looks frankly maniacal at times.Mia Sara is engaging and looks beautiful as ever.Bruce McGill has some funny bits as Van Dammes Boss.The very sexy Gloria Ruben also shows up as Walkers new partner. Timecop is not the greatest when it comes to plot-holes.But unlike the recent version of HG Wells Time machine, it is a very fun movie.And one of Van Dammes best.",
         "Timecop is a pretty hilarious movie, and it has all the trademarks of a Tapert/Raimi film (i.e., the guys who brought you Evil Dead, Hercules, Xena, Jack of All Trades...). It's definitely a big-screen movie, but they have some fun, even including dialogue that pokes fun at Jean-Claude's at times unintelligible accent. There are some decent martial arts set pieces, they don't spend too long on the time travel aspects (which is about par for the course for the guys who did time travel in Evil Dead, Hercules, and Xena...). Ron Silver makes a suitably sinister villain, but Bruce McGill steals the show as the protagonist's somewhat befuddled but loyal boss. There are the usual holes that accompany any time travel story, and a weird ending. With the feel-good ending, no one seems to realize that Max won't recall the last 10 years of his married life and time raising his kid! Still, it's a pretty good, not too deep, enjoyable movie.",
         "kicks? check punches? check signature semi-nude van damme splits? check van damme playing multiple roles? check 'Pete' from MacGyver? check time travel police going back in time wearing futuristic uniforms labeling themselves as Time Enforcement Commission officers indicating to those in the past that time travel will one day be possible even though TEC code 40.8 subsection 9 strictly forbids time travel with intent to alter the future as a crime punishable by death? check Van Damme takes a break from his usual tournament-style fare to bring us a movie based around a story rather than a series of jump kicks. I won't repeat the synopsis you can read on IMDb. What I will say is that this is honestly the single best movie of Van Damme's career. It made a solid attempt at a story, it had decent special effects and sound effects, the acting was as good as van damme gets, and the action was good. Perhaps if he had made a few more of this caliber he might have become a more stable box office draw rather than the queen of straight to video punch-and-kick drivel.",
         "Forgot how good this movie actually was! Definitely one of Van Dammes best and one of the better action movies in the 90's! Also Ron Silver is great as the bad guy \"You can forget about being my Chief of Staff, if slamming your head into the sideboard turns you into a Snivelling Weasel\" :D ... give it a watch you wont be disappointed!",
         "This is one of the best Action/Sci-Fi films ever made in my opinion with a kick ass story and 2 amazing performances from Van Damme and Mia Sara!. All the characters are wonderful, and i think this is Van Damme's 3rd best, plus Van Damme(as usual) and Mia Sara are simply amazing in this!. The effects were just awesome and one of the coolest scenes for me is when The future Van Damme confronts his wife it was rather tense and very moving, plus Ron Silver is extremely menacing as the main villain!. I thought Van Damme's acting was fantastic, and he and Mia Sara had amazing chemistry together, plus the opening is quite disturbing and very memorable. It's quite original and it had a fantastic all around cast, plus it's exciting throughout!. The finale is one of the best ever and, i thought the ending was really neat and quite emotional, plus It had some great fight scenes as well!. It's one of Van Damme's best performances, and i thought it was extremely well written and made as well, plus i can't believe this only has a 5.5 rating as it should be much much higher in my opinion!. It really is a brilliant film, and i just loved the whole concept of time traveling!, plus it's very imaginative and creative as well!. All the characters are very likable, and i really hope they make a true sequel to this with both Van Damme and Mia Sara back together!, plus it has quite a few shocking and disturbing scenes as well. Van Damme once again has a cool look,and i thought the scene where Van Damme visits Sarah Fielding in the hospital, was really moving and tense, plus the locations were also awesome!.There were also quite a few harsh jokes throwin' at Van Damme and he took them extremely well This is one of the best Action/Sc-Fi films ever made in my opinion with a kick ass story and 2 amazing performances from Van Damme and Mia Sara, and if you haven't seen it do so immediately!, you won't regret it's one of Van Damme's absolute best!. The Direction is amazing!.Peter Hyams does an amazing job here with wonderful camera work, fantastic angles, some great close up shots, great use of colors and he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!. There is a little bit of blood and violence. We get some bloody gunshot wounds, harsh beatings, a bloody broken nose,gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains spurting,wicked shattering arm,graphic fall victims, cool scar transformations, and other minor stuff. The Acting is amazing!. Jean Claude Van Damme is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, fantastic in the acting department, had amazing chemistry with Mia Sara, gives one of his best performances, had tons of charisma, had a lot of character, and just did an amazing job overall!. (Van Damme Rules!!!!!!!!, he is the man!). Mia Sara is also AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, she is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, was fantastic in the acting department had amazing chemistry with Van Damme, had a great smile, and was especially good in the finale!, she is one of my favorite actresses. (Mia Sara rules!!!!). Ron Silver is wonderful as the evil Senator McComb, he had some awesome one liners, had some great scenes with Van Damme, was extremely menacing and just did a wonderful job overall!. (Silver Rules). Bruce McGill is great in his role, he was very likable and did a great job i liked him lots. Gloria Reuben is hot, and did excellent with what she had to do, although i wished she had more screen time. Rest of the cast do great. Overall if you haven't seen this do so immediately you won't regret it it's one of the best Action-Sci-Fi films ever made, and Van Damme's 3rd best. ***** out of 5",
         "This was actually a decent film. If you can get past the gratuitous violence (a virtual requirement for Van Damme films), you might like this movie. Van Damme plays the title character who needs to stop a crooked politician from changing history while trying to decide whether to save his murdered wife. I liked this. Silver is good as the bad guy, and Van Damme is watchable. See it if you get the chance! *** out of ****",
         "'Timecop' probably represents Jean-Claude Van Damme at his very best - this movie demonstrates his ability... The movie itself is slick and some thought has obviously gone into it - some time-travel movies do fail on grounds concerning plausibility, though 'Timecop' is intelligent as it is enjoyable... The complexity of the film really finds the viewer respecting Van Damme a lot more, it simply isn't an action movie, though Van Damme shows that he still retains his amazing physical talents... I recently saw this movie on NBC, and though not seeing it from the start, it brought back memories of the entire film, and what a great film it is - I had originally thought about giving this a [6/10], then thought maybe [7 or 8/10]...I opted for [8/10]...(maybe leaning more towards nine)... :)",
         "I've only ever seen this film while drunk, so bear with me ... Awful Belgian 'actor' John Claude Van Damme grows an emergency mullet in order to go back in time and rescue Ferris Bueller's girlfriend. While in the past he runs into that chap out of the Kirstie Alley sitcom (the one about underwear where she's put on a lot of weight).Meanwhile, back in the future, the guy with the moustache who's been in loads of stuff gets killed by the future version of the guy from the Kirstie Alley sitcom. In retaliation, John Claude Van Damme kills the Kirstie Alley guy by throwing another version of the Kirstie Alley guy at him - the two sort of moulding together in a bubbling, bad special effects mess on the carpet. John Claude Van Damme then finds out he's had a kid in the future and that the guy with the moustache who was killed by the Kirstie Alley guy isn't dead after all. So that's alright then."

         "When the ability to travel through time is perfected, a new type of law enforcement agency is formed. It's called Time Enforcement Commission or TEC. A cop, Max Walker, is assigned to the group. On the day he was chosen, some men attack him and kill his wife. Ten years later Max is still grieving but has become a good agent for the TEC. He tracks down a former co-worker who went into the past to make money. Max brings him back for sentencing but not after telling Max that Senator McComb, the man in charge of TEC, sent him. Max has his eye on McComb.",
         "The perfection of time travel brings with it new opportunities for criminals. The government sets up a special police force (T.E.C.) to ensure the new technology isn't abused. Max Walker, one of these timecops learns of a corrupt politician's plot to become president using the device. Senator McComb discovers Walker on his trail and the real action begins--in Walker's own past!",
         "In Washington DC in 1994, the Senate Oversight Committee (SOC) is being spoken to in the capitol building by George Spota, who explains that for the past 20 years, Doctor Hans Kleindast, the Nobel laureate who help the government with the space program back in the 1960s and 1970s, has been doing research, and his field of research has been time travel. The SOC believes that Hans is a quack -- until George tells the SOC that Hans actually succeeded in his research and took a trip to the past then back to the present. You can't travel into the future because the future hasn't happened yet. George makes it clear that a covert agency is needed to police time travel, so the Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) is formed. Named as the director of the TEC is Commander Eugene Matuzak, formerly of the Washington DC police department. Senator Aaron McComb, who sees possibilities, agrees to chair the oversight on the new program. Sometime later, at a shopping center, TEC agent Max Walker and his wife Melissa are being watched by a pair of shady looking men. Later, at home. Max and Melissa spend some passionate time together. That night, Melissa is about to tell Max something extremely important when the phone rings. Max answers the phone and is told to go to TEC headquarters. Max gets dressed and as soon as Max opens the front door to go outside, he is attacked by the two men from the shopping center. As the two men are beating Max up. Max sees Aaron looking out the window of the bedroom that Melissa is still in, and Aaron is holding Melissa hostage, forcing Melissa to watch Max's beating. The two men outside then shoot Max, who is wearing a bulletproof vest -- and then an explosion engulfs the house, killing Melissa. On October 30, 1929, on Wall Street in New York City, a man named Lyle Atwood enters an office building and rides an elevator up to an office. There is a sudden ripple in the office, and Max enters from the future. It turns out that Lyle is Max's partner, and Lyle is planning to stop the depression from happening. Max wants to know who Lyle is working for, and Lyie calls two security men into the office to deal with Max. Max beats up the two security men, and Lyle pulls out a gun and opens fire on Max. When Lyle runs out of bullets, Max forces Lyle to admit that he's working for Aaron, and that Aaron has paid off a lot of other TEC agents as well. Lyle then jumps out the window. Max jumps out after Lyle, grabs him, and takes Lyle with him back to present time, which is now the year 2004, ten years after Melissa's murder. TEC judge Marshall sentences Lyle to be immediately executed, so Lyle is sent back to 1929 and is dropped to his death from the point in midair where Max and Lyle disappeared to 2004. At TEC Headquarters in 2004, Aaron, Max, and Matuzak are showing Senator Malcolm Nelson around the TEC building. Aaron reminds everyone that people who go back in time risk coming into contact with a past version of themselves. The same matter cannot occupy the same space at the same time, because if that happens, and if it's a person accidentally making physical contact with their past version, that person will die, and their body will disappear from the face of the Earth. Later, Max tells Matuzak that Aaron wants to shut down the TEC so no one can stop him from altering the past to his advantage, because Aaron is now running for President of the United States. Aaron's fading campaign for president is dealt a blow when he is denied federal campaign matching funds. Just before Max wakes up, two men break into his home to kill him, but Max turns the tables and kills the two men who broke in. TEC internal affairs investigator Sarah Fielding questions Max. Max soon learns that Sarah may be on the wrong side in this. Max must travel back and forth in time to bring Aaron down...and when Max goes back to 1994 and finds out what Melissa wanted to tell him 10 years ago, it gives Max incentive to at least try to prevent Melissa's murder.",
