         "Fans of the television show will probably die laughing, but some others may enjoy it also. The film focuses on Beavis and Butt-Head as they go on a cross country road trip to recover their stolen television, but unknowingly fall deep into a plot involving the theft of a man-made biological weapon. The cast of voices are a real treat, especially Robert Stack as an ATF agent. Tune in if you're in the mood for a few laughs. 3/4",
         "If you're a fan of Beavis and Butthead you will love this it's not much different from the show and it's awesome! It has a good story and some great music by White Zombie and AC/DC as well, the soundtrack is great! This movie should be in the IMDB top 250 I don't care what anybody thinks this cartoon is too fun not to enjoy",
         "Beavis and Butthead Do America is as funny (if not funnier) than the television show. It looks at the two morons like never before (with intelligence). The plot involves the duo on a cross-country odyssey to \"score\". Along the way, we overhear the voices of Robert Stack, Cloris Leachman, Eric Bogosian, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Greg Kinnear and David Letterman. And of course, Mike Judge (who directed, co-wrote and voiced 5 characters) who created this (God help me for saying) satirical masterpiece brings this film to a fine edge that isn't lost years later. For it's fans it's entertaining, in spots hysterically funny, and even cool to an extent; it's a film that, in a way, should get more credit than it got, but as a film on a level of 'cult' status it ranks in the background of other comedy peaks from the X-ers of the 90s. Where else will you get Dave Letterman playing former Motley Crue roadies turned drifters?",
         "I enjoyed this film a lot more than I expected to. I was never very taken with Beavis and Butthead's short sketches on MTV, and in truth they've never really taken off in England the same way they did in the States. The somewhat obvious satire lacks the gentle wit of Mike Judge's other creation, \"King of the Hill\", and spending 80 minutes in their company was a dubious prospect. However, ...Do America sensibly opens out the scope, taking in less broad targets. For a start, we have Beavis and Butthead's hippie teacher, who gently strums his spiritual song, \"Lesbian Seagull\". It's a testament to the profile of the cartoon that Englebert Humperdinck gives his own rendition of this for the end titles. But best of all is their neighbour, redneck Tom Anderson (Catchphrase: \"I'd love to get my hands on those two b******s for whacking off in my camper van\"), who, while not the same character, has the exact same voice, personality and appearance of Hank from \"Hill\". Judge obviously knew when he was on to a good thing and built a series around this great character. The plot is brilliantly silly, with the two boys getting involved, unwittingly, in a plot that sees a killer virus, attempted murder and the emergence of World War III. President Clinton even makes an appearance towards the end. Movie culture is openly lambasted, starting with King Kong, and taking in an opening title sequence (theme song by Isaac Hayes, a year before South Park) that parodies both Shaft and Charlie's Angels. Look out too for the climatic \"slow motion\" sequence. Jokes are puerile, such as the two obnoxious leads laughing uncontrollably at the word \"wood\", or another scene where a man asks the pair \"have you got a match?\" \"Yeah,\" replies Butthead, the slightly smarter of the two, \"my butt and ... uh ... your butt\". It's childish, but it made me laugh. Not the most subtle exercise in wit, the film is still a worthwhile, and, by it's own small ambitions, successful picture.",
         "I know a lot of you who have never seen Beavis and Butthead probably think very little of the show based on the low-brow nature of it (I was one of them), but if you give this movie a chance you'll see that it's actually as well written and at times as, dare I say, subtle as King of the Hill. Beavis and Butthead have their TV stolen and when trying to get it back are mistaken for hit men by drunken drunk Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis, as I was rather shocked to find out once the credits rolled), who sends them on a mission to 'do his wife' Dallas. Misinterpreting this as any horny teenagers would, B+B head to Las Vegas to carry out the terrible act. But we discover (they don't, however) that Dallas and Muddy are part of international weapons conspiracy and our two teen-aged heroes are being set-up to take the blame. So, as they take off across the country, causing absolute mayhem wherever they go, the ATF closely follow, giving full body cavity searches to everyone and anyone they meet at the order of head honcho Agent Flemming (the late Robert Stack), who comes out with some brilliant, deadpan one-liners. The set-pieces are wonderful and the mushroom-induced dream sequence by Rob Zombie looks amazing. Mike Judge's animation style also brilliant. Avoiding bright, primary colors used in shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy and Futurama, he uses mainly softer colors, pencil-effect scenery and water-color backgrounds. It's a sort of calming, easy-going animation style that he's totally made his own. You should totally check-out this movie. Don't be put off by what you may have heard or may think of Beavis and Butthead. You'll be conning yourself out of loads of laughs if you do. And look-out for Daria Morgendorfer in the 'Lesbian Seagull' scene.",
         "This movie was directed by Mike Judge (office Space). After finding out their TV is stolen, Beavis and Butthead are determined to get it back. After failing stealing a TV from school, they stumble in a seedy hotel room with Muddy Grimes lying on his bed. He gets them confused with the killers he hired to \"Do\" his wife and sends them to Las Vegas. Mike judge is a good writer/director, he has a dry sense of humor that appeals to me in most of his work (Except king of the hill, Damn that's dry!). The movie is a wild-goose-chase for Beavis and Butthead, and they stay oblivious as much as on their MTV show. I don't think any fan of the MTV show would disagree that Mike Judge did the best job possible-for this movie.",
         "I am sure if you watched Beavis and Butt-head on television you had to see this movie. Mike Judge is excellent, his stuff is very enjoyable and funny. I know a lot of people think Beavis and Butt-head are the worst thing ever, but it is down right hilarious stuff in my book.",
         "The controversial but highly popular MTV animated series hits the big screen in this surprisingly entertaining and humorous film from the crazed mind of Mike Judge. The two dim-witted teenage friends have their television stolen and set out to find it. However it seems that a chemical weapon of mass destruction has fallen into the pair's hands. Now national security is a major issue as the two go on a long journey to some of the country's most famous locales. The authorities always seem to be two steps behind in this film that has a comedic life of its own. Interesting voice characterizations by Judge, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, Cloris Leachman and the golden-voiced Robert Stack all match their animated alter-egos perfectly. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",
         "BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO America, in my opinion, is a pure gut-buster. I laughed really hard when Tom (Mike Judge) said, \"Must be them d*** buzzard-hogs,\" while Beavis (Mike Judge) and Butt-Head (Mike Judge) were doing their heavy metal humming. As a matter of fact, I laughed a just about every funny scene. Also, I thought that Dallas (Demi Moore) looked very pretty, even though she was one of the bad guys. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure gut-buster to all you fans of the \"BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD\" TV show who have not seen the movie. You're in for a lot of gut-busting laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",
         "This is a hard one for me to rate because I'm a fan of the Beavis & Butt-Head TV show, but this adaptation is pretty different. Whilst the TV show episodes only went for 10 minutes, in B&BDA the guys are off on a feature length journey around America. Of course the plot line is going to be pretty far-fetched to get Beavis & Butt-Head to leave Highland (let alone their couch), and the humour of Beavis & Butt-Head will wear thin for most people after half an hour, but I have to say I'm a fan of these guys, and the movie is pretty damn entertaining. Still, I think the movie lacks some of the 'social commentary' aspects of the TV show. Yes, the TV show had lots of toilet humour and Beavis & Butt-Head doing stupid things, but I actually think the show had more depth to it than most people gave it credit for, especially with the stereotypical characters it dealt with. The support cast of the TV show is absent here; no Coach Buzzcut, no Daria, no Stewart, no Todd, and McVicker (my favourite; the principal driven to a nervous wreck by Beavis & Butt-Head) plays only a minimal role. I guess this is something that had to be done to get Beavis & Butt-Head out on the road to make it more of a 'cinematic' experience, but it is a shame that people watching only the movie will miss out on some of the funny stereotypical characters the show featured. Beavis & Butt-Head Do America is definitely not for everyone; there is nothing 'offensive' about it, but most people will find the humour dumb and repetitive. These people don't get what Beavis & Butt-Head is about: the extreme stupidity of teenagers raised on too much TV! Whilst I prefer the TV series to this, it definitely is 80 minutes of good turn-your-brain off entertainment! 3/5 stars"
