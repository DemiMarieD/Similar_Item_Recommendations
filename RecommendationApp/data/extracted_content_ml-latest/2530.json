No mean feat considering how bleak the ending to the first movie was.\r\n\r\nI love this movie. The legendary James Franciscus _(The Valley Of Gwangi_)  is astronaut Brent - sent to find the missing Taylor. He finds him, of course, deep _beneath_ the ruins of a post apocalyptic city - imprisoned by _psychotic mutants_ with the power of telepathy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, those _pesky apes_ are marching on the city to find out just what the hell is going on and what all the kerfuffle is about regarding reports of _crucified apes and bleeding statues._\r\n\r\nThis all leads to a shocking climax _you wont forget in a long time._\r\n\r\nIt's all rather disturbing and that is precisely why it succeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Potential Kermode",

      "synopsis": "Following the events of previous 'Planet of the Apes' movie, time-displaced astronaut George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and the mute human Nova (Linda Harrison) are riding on horseback through the desert of the Forbidden Zone. Suddenly and without warning, walls of fire spring up from the ground and deep chasms open in the earth. Confused by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and disappears before Nova's eyes. Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second human spaceship has crash-landed after being sent in search of Taylor and his crew. Like Taylor's ship, it has traveled forward through time into Earth's distant future. Two astronauts emerge whom are John Brent (James Franciscus) and the gravely wounded captain of ship, known only as Skipper, who soon dies from his wounds. Brent reads the Earth year on his crashed ship as 3955 A.D., and he believes he has traveled to another planet, unaware that this is Earth of the far-future. He encounters Nova still riding on Taylor's horse and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags, but he cannot get her to speak. Hoping Taylor is still alive, Brent rides with Nova to Ape City, where he is shocked to discover a civilization of bipedal, talking apes. He observes the militarist gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) leading a rally calling for the apes to invade the Forbidden Zone, conquer it, exterminate all humans, and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of the orangutan ruling leader Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) as well as the chimpanzee minority of Ape City. Brent is spotted and wounded by a gorilla soldier. He is taken by Nova to the home of Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter), who treat his wound and tell him of their previous encounter with Taylor. The two humans hide when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on the invasion of the Forbidden Zone. Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas. Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them escape. Brent and Nova flee into the Forbidden Zone where they hide in a cave which Brent discovers to be the ruins of the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, sparking the realization that he has traveled to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. Following a humming sound deeper into the underground tunnels, Brent begins to hear voices telling him to kill Nova. Entering the remains of St. Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who worship an intact nuclear bomb. Meanwhile back in Ape City, Dr. Zaius prepares to accompany General Ursus for the invasion by several armed gorilla battalions into the Forbidden Zone to exterminate any humans there. They are temporarily halted by a peace protest by the chimpanzee minority whom the gorillas proceed to detain. As Ursus and Zaius lead the huge ape army away from Ape City into the desert, Cornelius and Zira plot their own excursion into the Forbidden Zone desert to look for Taylor's spaceship by the Dead Lake deep in the zone where he told them in the previous movie where he crashed it. Back in the underground city, Brent and Nova are captured by the mutant humans and are telepathically interrogated. Brent reveals the apes are marching on the Forbidden Zone and will find their underground city. Above ground, the telepaths attempt to repel the ape army when it arrives by using their mental abilities to project illusions of fire and other horrors, as they had done to Taylor and Nova. Dr. Zaius sees through the illusions, however, and leads the ape army through to the ruined city. With the apes closing in, the telepaths plan to detonate their \"Divine Bomb\" as a last resort. They hold a religious ceremony, at the height of which they remove their masks to reveal that their appearance has been grotesquely mutated by centuries of exposure to nuclear fallout. Brent is separated from Nova and taken to a cell, where he finds Taylor imprisoned. The mutant Ongaro (Don Pedro Colley) uses his telepathic powers to force Brent and Taylor to fight each other to the death. Nova escapes her guard and runs to the cell, screaming her first word: \"Taylor!\" This breaks Ongaro's concentration, freeing Brent and Taylor from his control, and they overpower and kill him. Brent describes the bomb the mutants worship and Taylor recognizes it as a \"doomsday bomb\", capable of destroying all life on the surface of the planet. The heavily armed apes invade the subterranean city, killing Nova and making their way to the cathedral, shooting, stabbing, and clubbing all the mutant humans they see. They are confronted by Méndez (Paul Richards), the mutant leader who raises the bomb into activation position before being gunned down. Brent and Taylor attempt to stop Ursus from accidentally setting off the weapon, but Taylor is shot. Brent manages to take a rifle off a dead gorilla where he personally kills Ursus and several of his gorilla soldiers before being overwhelmed and shot dead by the other gorillas. The mortally wounded Taylor pleads with Dr. Zaius for help, but Zaius refuses, saying that man is only capable of destruction and that all humans must be exterminated. In his last moment, Taylor defiantly brings his hand down on the activation switch, triggering the bomb, which detonates... thus wiping out all life on the planet.",

         "Beneath was the best Planet of the Apes film bar none. Everything was bigger and better this time around: bigger sets, more gorillas, the whole of New York instead of a mere Statue of Liberty, and, best of all, faceless, telepathic mutants than can kill with the mind. Yes, I was once ten years old. Watched again with many years of hindsight, it's clear that, while entertaining, Beneath was produced without anything approaching artistry. The ultimate in sequels, it tries to tell the same story twice as big, but with only half the success. Until Battle came along and picked the flesh off Apes' rotting carcass this was the worst sequel because it did nothing new with the format. Even the working title - Planet of the Apes Revisited - betrays the lack of thought and the desire for finance that went into this one. A virtually identical plotline rattles along at a fair pace, meaning all subtlety is jettisoned. The allegories are also confused by not really being allegories at all. Look at the metaphor for anti-war protestors by casting chimps as ... er, anti-war protestors. A look at how man often judges another man on the colour of his skin is alluded to ... er, by having an ape judging a man on the colour of his skin. (On this note, perversely for a film that purports liberal satire, the only one of the mutants to demonstrate real cruelty was Don Pedro Colley, the sole black character in the film. And despite its worthiness, I don't think I've ever seen another film where a man's credit is given as \"Negro\"). However, I did have to smile at the chimp that punningly complains about \"gorilla brutality\". The decreased budget (a sensible studio idea to cut the finance of the sequels to a hit movie) shows with some of the ape extras having decidedly ropy masks in the crowd scenes. The opening of the picture also recaps the first, cannily highlighting the glaring difference between Roddy McDowall's and David Watson's performances as Cornelius. Watson, standing in for an absent McDowall, does reasonably well but really doesn't look anything like him, even under latex. Note too how all the ape masks give the actors lisps, something I never noticed before. Never mind apes, anyone would think James Franciscus had landed on the planet of the Pertwees. There's also some abysmal back projection work when Franciscus is wrestling on top of the horsedrawn carriage. The mutants are pretty good, though their prayers to \"The Holy Fallout\" are a little silly. Why do they wear human masks anyway? Where do they make them? I dunno, I don't make the rules up, do I? Of course, the main problem is the pointless game of one-upmanship it plays with its source. There's no longer any element of surprise that this is Earth, so the ruined monuments, nice as they are, no longer have any great effect. It misses the point, also: the Statue of Liberty is not just a relic, but a symbol. New York Subway is just where people caught trains. And as impressive as the effects are, if not directed well \u0096 which they aren't, particularly \u0096 then it becomes fatuous. It's weird how all four sequels were made within a year of each other, yet at least two of them tried something new. Beneath came two years after the original yet has a rehashed \"in it for the money\" feel all the way through, right down to its abrupt, slightly unsatisfactory climax. Yet despite the many, many faults I've levelled at it, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is still a very enjoyable film. Not in the sense of the first, which genuinely had something to say, but in the guise of pulp SF then this sequel is well worth seeing. In fact, despite the slating I've given it, I still awarded it 6/10.",
         "\"Beneath\" is a film that epitomizes the best and worst that a sequel to a masterpiece, as \"Planet Of The Apes\" was, could be. For me, it is the most watchable of the sequels only because it's the only one that stays in the familiar territory established by the first film. But oh that ending.... I really can not understand why the heck Richard Zanuck allowed Charlton Heston to talk him into going with that downer ending that has already been referred to by others. The only reason why Heston pushed it wasn't because it made for good cinema but because he wanted to singlehandedly see to it that he never have to do another Apes sequel again. It's a pity that Heston never realized that the best sequel story one could have explored was what happened to Taylor and Nova afterwards, and could have made for some equally compelling drama as the first film did. To me, the main appeal of the first film wasn't the Ape society, it was the character of Taylor and his fascinating odyssey from misanthrope to defender of the species, only to see his earlier feelings borne out in the shock ending. The question that should have been addressed next in a sequel was, what would Taylor do now that he realized he was on Earth? What other things were there to discover on the planet? (Heck, you could have easily made a sequel movie without the apes returning, as far as I'm concerned!) Alas, because of the plot device imposed by this film (and Heston's inability to realize what a good thing he might have had going for himself), the rest of the series had to veer off into what was for me, a more uninteresting story line focusing on the Apes and their inevitable rise to power. Plot holes and depressing ending notwithstanding, \"Beneath\" is still worth watching to see the traces of what could have been a great film that are there. The mutant storyline and their dwellings underneath the remains of New York still has an irresistible viewing quality to it. I do not recommend watching it in tandem with its magnificent predecessor though, because that's only going to make you more angry about the ending of this film.",
         "(Major Spoilers!!!) \"Beneath...\" has to rank as one of the meanest movies ever made in its treatment to its main character. Consider this...Brent wakes up to his space ship's crash landing, realizing it's 3955(?)[what happened to 3978?], so everyone he ever knew except Skipper is dead...then skipper dies too! He finds out that (gulp) apes rule, then gets shot for his discovery (same as Taylor). Is rewarded with white, stinging \"vet\" powder plentifully poured on his (still bleeding) gunshot wound, by Zira. Gets captured and sentenced to ape target practice; en route he gets an ape boot shoved into his larynx while said ape tries to pull his arm off. Escapes while apes on horseback fire their guns at him. Goes underground and realizes where he's at. Painful!...and the movie is only into its first 45 minutes. What else can happen to the poor guy? Well...as his mental stability starts heading toward the brink of insanity, he does some depressing sight-seeing, watches helplessly as mind control forces him to near drown Nova, then face telepathic inquisitors who proceed to scare the crap out of him with a whoosh of fire, fry his ear drums with high pitch sound waves, thought-project agonizing, searing pain that contorts his whole body and again, he watches helplessly as he's forced to near suffocate (poor) Nova with a brutal passionless loo-oong kiss. Then!... he's required to sit still during mass (for some people, this is very painful) and realizes that everyone else in attendance is a replicant of \"Gray's Anatomy\". He then catches up with friend Taylor (finally)...and Taylor proceeds to beat the crap out of him too, by kicking him in the face and chest, strangling him, shoving his back into cell bars with long sharp spikes sticking out, mercilessly stepping on his face, strangling him some more and delivering some shattering right hooks to the jaw (all under mind control, of course). After the fight, instead of friendly gossip, they realize they're about 100 yards away from an active bomb, not just any old bomb, but THE Doomsday Bomb. And they're trapped inside a locked cell. And an army of Militia Apes are attacking! Finally... escape! but Nova ain't coming. Back to the church, Brent witnesses Taylor (after spending the whole movie trying to locate him) get fatally shot, knows he's now alone and goes on a one man kamikaze assault with his one puny rifle against 100 gorilla sub machine guns. And if that ain't enough, THEN he runs out of ammo! And he doesn't even get the satisfaction of seeing Taylor's final efforts. What happens to him is what you'd want to see happen to the worst of villains, but not to the heroic character. After all this, it would have been better to stay in bed. That aside, \"Planet of the Apes\" WAS a tough act to follow. \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" cinematography does border on spectacle and alot of credit should go to director Ted Post for getting alot more out of the half baked premise and limitations he was trapped in. Many still frames and action sequences from the film are just as epic-like, colorful and bizarre that is on par with (and in many instances, exceeds) the original; but the editing in the original surpasses the sequel!(not Ted's fault). Still...\"Beneath's\" camera angles are far superior than any of the sequels that followed. Composer Leornard Rosenman created a very eerie, foreboding music score that touches on some semblance to Jerry Goldsmith's music from the original, while taking it into a different direction that effectively captures the mood of the film that works perfectly. It's unavoidable that both \"Planet\" and \"Beneath...\" have a flavor of their own considering all obstacles, so it's appropriate that the both scores follow suit in different scales; they're both brilliant. Charlton Heston can't be blamed for his lack of enthusiasm, considering what he was presented with. If a more fuller and better continuation of the story was better fleshed out...who knows (after all, look at his lone survivor interpretation from \"The Omega Man\", not far removed from his position at the end of \"Planet...\"). But a more diversified storyline was necessary that needed splitting the story between Taylor and the Apes which changed the flow of what followed previously...because the first movie was presented subjectively through the eyes of Taylor. The addition of the new elements that carried the narrative forward was not going to be consistent with director Franklin Schaffner's original subjective approach to the first \"Apes\" that made it so successful. So it's very appropriate that James Franciscus' 'Brent' is allowed to discover Ape City because the Apes are one of the main reason people would want to return to the story anyway. The other reason is Taylor! (and Nova). And that is the main problem. Because, NO sequel was ever planned for Planet of the Apes! If a storyline was preplanned then this may have paralleled author Pierre Boulle's excellent 'Bridge on the River Kwai' more closely if additional characters were already evident, like the way the story in 'Kwai' continued after William Holden escapes from the prison camp (as Heston did from Ape City) while the events flipped back and forth between Holden's increasing dilemma and that of Alec Guiness' misguided actions. Sadly, (because it's only 1967 before sequels were recognized as obvious cash cows) 'Planet...' didn't have the luxury of foresight of the epic possibilities that could have logically continued the story forward in the same care and quality. Thus we're left with a more emphasis on action orientation, less on character growth and a more speedy presentation that's intended to camouflage the story's inadequacy. It's almost easy to say that \"Beneath...\" is better appreciated on its own merit, as an almost separate entity from \"Planet...\" because of its radical introduction to science fiction elements new to the story. But it's not that easy! Comparison is unavoidable! On the many plus sides are: James Gregory's scene stealing 'General Ursus' that propels the conflict between ape and man (especially his rousing call-to-arms speech); Maurice Evans' 'Dr.Zaius' who steals scenes right back; the buried underground scenes, the Ape Army on the move, Cornelius and Zira's home; Brent and Nova's underground odyssey; the steam bath; more (if brief) views of Ape City and the cages; General Ursus' helmet symbolically backed by the many more militant gorillas; and the under rated James Franciscus who took upon himself to further flesh out more of his character's heroic attributes. And ANY scene with Taylor! that is all too brief. One thing is near certain: \"Beneath...\" is never boring in its breakneck pace in storytelling. but it could have been better if there weren't so many 'egos' involved in the decision-making process of delivering a quality continuation of the Apes saga. Just think of the possibility if Nova was able to retain her pregnancy scene cut from the first film, the bomb wasn't doomsday, and she survives the end of the second film. Still kind of fun entertainment! 6 out of 10",
         "As an avid fan of the original Planet of the Apes, I had always avoided the sequels (though unfortunately not the remake), thinking they'd be so cheesy that they would harm the greatness of the original. I finally got around to the first sequel, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, and, frankly, I'm surprised at how good it is. I'm a big fan of corny '70s sci-fi anyway, and Beneath is certainly cheaper and goofier than the original. But its themes and ideas are surprisingly intelligent, and it creates suspense and excitement very well. It also expands the mythology of its universe, which is always a positive to geeks like myself. I'd say the only big faults are the much smaller budget, which causes the ape makeup to appear much less convincing than it originally was, and the casting of a Charlton Heston impersonator to play the lead. The story is that James Franciscus is another astronaut looking for Heston and his crew. And since he eventually does find Heston, I don't understand why they wanted someone who looked so much like their original star.",
         "This first sequel to the '68 science fiction hit has all the markings of something rushed into production. There was no time to craft a story which explores the truly interesting possibilities of astronaut Taylor's continuing odyssey on a future world turned upside down. The story could have and should have concentrated on the evolving struggle between the ruling class of apes and the backward humans. Instead, the filmmakers created a new threat for this film, a secret society of human mutants living underground. They show up in the 2nd half of this feature and, in prolonged scenes, show off their telepathic powers in torturing the heroes. The heroes, in this case, are another astronaut (Franciscus) who followed Taylor's trajectory to this other planet and Taylor himself (Heston, reprising his role briefly). Wow, what an original concept - another astronaut, who, in an accelerated version of the first film's events, also finds Ape City, encounters two sympathetic chimps, gets captured and escapes. Are we watching some kind of a repeat? The quick pace of this picture is probably its best aspect; this stresses action. However, the pace is so fast that some crucial points in geography are sacrificed: getting to the Forbidden Zone from Ape City is just a short walk in a tunnel for some, while others have to trudge for days overhead. In a slight nod to the satirical aspects of the original film, we do get to see religion being mocked (the original satirized the social & political anchors of a community). But, it's not a very subtle jab. The mutants profess to be more intelligent than either the heroes or the apes, which they seem to prove with their advanced mind powers, but they spend most of their time worshiping a nuclear bomb, chanting silly songs - they really picked a strange form of idolatry, but maybe they're simply crazed. This movie throws together a lot of science fiction concepts but the resulting brew is rather bland. It's a decent action piece, not much more. Franciscus shows he is no Heston; he overacts in most of his scenes, as if he had no clue on how to depict a man realizing where he's actually landed, but then again, he wasn't the skipper on this 2nd ship (the lead officer dies soon after they crash-land); we're not watching a leader but a follower try to carry the picture. I was struck by how Heston towered over him in their brutal fight scene. McDowall is also missing; his role of Cornelius is played by actor Watson. Evans & Gregory are pretty good as the ape leaders but whoever stuck them in ape suits for the sauna scene should have thought about it a few more minutes. This movie ends everything on a grotesquely conclusive note, but they managed to find a way to continue the story in \"Escape From the Planet of the Apes.\"",
         "The first film is awesome. But the 2nd one was always my favorite. It has strange desert locations, weird underground subway tunnels, odd melted cityscapes, telepathic mutants who worship a \"doomsday bomb\". It has more of Linda Harrison of the fabled fur bikini. It has both Chuck Heston and James Franciscus beating the crap out of each other! It has naked apes in steam-baths! I was always shocked by the nihilistic and super-violent ending when I saw this film as a child and a recent re-viewing shows it to still be a disturbingly grim bout of gun play. The director, Ted Post, also directed the 2nd of the Dirty Harry films and he shows a Peckinpah-like ability to \"put the sting back in Death\". What is amusing today is watching the film conclude with James Franciscus pinned to a wall with bullet holes stitched across his chest and Chuck Heston clutching his bloody fingers to the \"button\" thus leading to the complete destruction of the entire planet...and then an old MPAA rating pops up immediately telling you you have just watched a G-Rated film!",
         "Good and frantic science-fiction movie with a first rate James Franciscus and special intervention of Charlton Heston who literally disappears in the beginning and re-appears on the ending . This known story is the second and best of the primates sequels ; it starts when Brent (James Franciscus) through the same time warp crashes on the far planet and meets the gorgeous native Nova (Linda Harrison). At the start they trek across the desert , after that he learns the culture where simians rule over humans and they are divided in three lineage : gorilla , chimpanzee and orangutan . Later on, he discovers humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts . Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum . A couple of chimps named Cornelius (David Watson replacing Roddy McDowall) and Zira(Kim Hunter) think otherwise and even agree Brent escape , following the same traces as Taylor (Charlton Heston) . Meanwhile, an expedition commanded by militaristic General Ursus (James Gregory) and Dr. Zaius(Maurice Evans) sets out the forbidden zone where live human mutants (Victor Buono, Jeff Corey , among them) who survived a nuclear explosion several years before . Brent and Nova find an underground civilization in the ruins of bomb-blasted N.Y.C. until a downbeat and bleak final with the mutants worshipping a nuclear missile . This is a nice sci-fi flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about origin of human being and nuclear catastrophe , though also packs action, adventures, intrigue and entertainment. In spite of time and being mostly a replay of the original movie , energy remains still and turns out to be an enjoyable following full of fantasy and suspense . Exciting writing credits by Paul Dehn and Mort Abrahams from Pierre Boulle novel . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent , spectacular production design with excellent sets by Walter Scott and great visual effects by means of matte paintings by L.B. Abbot . Glimmer and luminous cinematography by Milton Krasner. Phenomenal make-up by John Chambers, a first-rate expert, such as proved in 'Blade runner, Ssss, Island of Dr Moreau' among others . Sensational musical score by a top-notch Leonard Rosenman though imitating sounds from the great Jerry Goldsmith .The picture is lavishly produced by usual Arthur P. Jacobs , producer of whole saga, and well directed by Ted Post , realizing a similar work to Franklyn J Schaffner , utilizing a great visual sense. It's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series, 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes'(73, J.Lee Thompson)",
         "Originally entitled ''Planet of the Apes Revisited'', Ted Post took over direction from Franklin Schaffner in what is the best of the Planet of the Apes films after the original. While it deviates significantly from what the audience might have imagined would happen, script writer Paul Dehn takes us a step closer to understanding how this ''upside down'' civilization came to be. The film is hindered by having less subtle commentary to make than its predecessor did (the Vietnam overtones are hard to miss), but none the less the excellent Cathedral sequence - ''the almighty bomb, who created heaven under earth'' - is masterfully orchestrated. A credit to Dehn and to composer Leonard Rosenman, who more than fills the shoes of Jerry Goldsmith in providing an riveting score for the film. Controversy has always centred around the film's ending more than any other feature of it. Those who critisise it miss the point - this was intended to be the LAST apes film, and although producer Arthur Jacobs kept his mind open for a possible 3rd film, it was felt that another movie set in a post-apocalyptic ape ruled world would just be ''flogging a dead horse''. One of the greatest features of these films, started by the Statue of Liberty sequence in the original, was that they all contained ''shocker'' endings, designed to send a shiver down the spine of the cinema audience. Beneath is so final, so clear cut, so definate in its climax - and is successful BECAUSE of this. 'Escape' featured the talking baby Chimp at its end. 'Conquest' featured the apes take over in its ultimate moments. Beneath suffers less than the other films from having an inadiquate budget, but is hindred by Chuck Heston's absence. The fact that James Franciscus looks so similar is slightly irritating. But considering the storyline, script, locations, music and great shocker ending, this film is a definate 'hit' for the series. And as for Linda Harrison........well, let's just say I've kept the best to the last.....",
         "*** out of **** I guess you could say that this first sequel to PLANET OF THE APES is a nostalgic pleasure for me; I got hooked on it as a child and while I still think it's an interesting followup to the original, as an adult I'm naturally more aware of its flaws. Yet it still works out as a good adventure film; less of a cerebral experience like PLANET OF THE APES, and more of a comic book story. James Franciscus plays astronaut Brent, sent along the same trajectory as Taylor's (Charlton Heston's) old ship in an effort to rescue him. He crash-lands in the same vicinity as his friend, and goes through a similar nightmare when he comes to discover that the planet he's stranded on is dominated by intelligent, talking apes with a decidedly low opinion of mankind. General Ursus (James Gregory) is a war-hungry gorilla leader who's anxious to investigate strange unearthly occurrences in the Forbidden Zone with the aid of the ever-skeptical scientist Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans in a reprisal of his role from Part One). Luckily, Brent runs into Taylor's mate, Nova (Linda Harrison looking prettier than she did in PLANET) and she is able to lead him to kindly chimpanzee couple, Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (David Watson this time; Roddy McDowall was busy directing a film). The pacifistic simians try to help their human friends along their journey to find Taylor, but Brent and Nova only succeed in getting themselves captured by gorillas anyway. Up to this midway point in the film, all we're really seeing is a rehash of the first APES movie, which feels obligatory to set up the scenario. Where this chapter starts to develop its own identity and really take off is in its second half, as Brent and Nova escape and find themselves going underground (literally) in the Forbidden Zone and discovering the ruins of a ravaged city, along with a community of radiation-scarred mutations who have mastered mental telepathy and worship an atomic bomb as their god who has \"created\" them. And they know it won't be long before the Ape Army will invade their sanctuary. Charlton Heston felt that sequels were not very challenging for an actor in those days, so at first he resisted appearing in this movie. He eventually agreed on what gradually evolved into a more extended \"cameo\" in BENEATH as a favor to Richard Zanuck, since the producer had taken a gamble on making the original film when Heston asked him to. The resulting sequel can be a downbeat and unusually pessimistic viewing experience, but in an odd way that actually helps to work in its favor. The next entry was ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES (1971).",
         "Very high quality sequel to the original. No, it was not quite as good as the original but the performances and the story were both strong. Just watched it on DVD and forgot about how creepy the underground mutant people were. Especially when they were chanting to their \"god\". James Franciscus gave a very good performance and Linda Harrison is simply HOT! The ending was a little too abrupt but the movie is well worth seeing and owning on DVD."

         "Brent is an American astronaut, part of a team sent to locate missing fellow American astronaut, George Taylor. Following Taylor's known flight trajectory, the search and rescue team crash lands on an unknown planet much like Earth in the year 3955, with Brent being the only survivor of the team. What Brent initially does not know, much like Taylor didn't initially know when he landed here before Brent, is that he has landed back on Earth in the future, in the vicinity of what was New York City. Brent finds evidence that Taylor has been on the planet. In Brent's search for Taylor, he finds that the planet is run by a barbaric race of English speaking apes, whose mission is in part to annihilate the human race. Brent eventually locates some of those humans, who communicate telepathically and who live underground to prevent detection by the apes. These humans, who are in their own way as barbaric as the apes, want in turn to protect their species. Brent has to figure out a way to save himself under the circumstances, which may be more difficult to accomplish in the battle between the races on this planet.",
