         "content": "Roger Ebert\r\nFebruary 27, 1997 \r\n\r\nThe heavyweight title fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Zaire on Oct. 30, 1974--\u201dThe Rumble in the Jungle\u201d--is enshrined as one of the great sports events of the century. It was also a cultural and political happening.\r\n\r\nInto the capital of Kinshasa flew planeloads of performers for an \u201cAfrican Woodstock,\u201d TV crews, Howard Cosell at the head of an international contingent of sports journalists, celebrity fight groupies like Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, and of course the two principals: Ali, then still controversial because of his decision to be a conscientious objector, and Foreman, now huggable and lovable in TV commercials but then seen as fearsome and forbidding.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm young, I'm handsome, I'm fast, I'm strong, and I can't be beat,\u201d Ali told the press. They didn't believe him. Foreman had destroyed George Frazier, who had defeated Ali. Foreman was younger, bigger and stronger, with a punch so powerful, Mailer recalled, \u201cthat after he was finished with a heavy punching bag, it had a depression pounded into it.\u201d Ali was 33 and thought to be over the hill. The odds were 7-1 against him.\r\n\r\nThe Zaire that they arrived in was a country much in need of foreign currency and image refurbishment. Under the leadership of Mobutu Sese Seko (\u201cthe archetype of a closet sadist,\u201d said Mailer), the former Belgian Congo had became a paranoid police state; the new stadium built to showcase the fight was rumored to hold 1,000 political prisoners in cells in its catacombs.\r\n\r\nDon King, then at the dawn of his career as a fight promoter, had sold Mobutu on the fight and raised $5 million for each fighter. The \u201cAfrican Woodstock,\u201d featuring such stars as B.B. King, James Brown and Miriam Makeba, was supposed to pay for part of that. For Ali, the fight in Africa was payback time for the hammering he'd taken in the American press for his refusal to fight in Vietnam. For Foreman, it was more complicated. So great was the pro-Ali frenzy, Foreman observed, that when he got off the plane the crowds were surprised to find that he was also a black man. \u201cWhy do they hate me so much?\u201d he wondered.\r\n\r\nLeon Gast's \u201cWhen We Were Kings,\u201d which just received an Oscar nomination, is like a time capsule; the original footage has waited all these years to be assembled into a film because of legal and financial difficulties. It is a new documentary of a past event, recapturing the electricity generated by Muhammad Ali in his prime. Spike Lee, who with Mailer and Plimpton provides modern commentary on the 1974 footage, says young people today do not know how famous and important Ali was. He is right. \u201cWhen I fly on an airplane,\u201d Ali once told me, \u201cI look out of the window and I think, I am the only person that *everyone* down there knows about.\u201d It is not bragging if you are only telling the truth.\r\n\r\nThe original film apparently started as a concert documentary. Then the fight was delayed because of a cut to Foreman's eye. The concert went ahead as scheduled, and then the fighters, their entourages and the press settled down to wait for the main event. No one really thought Ali had a chance--perhaps not even Ali, who seems reflective and withdrawn in a few private moments, although in public he predicted victory.\r\n\r\nHow could he have a chance, really? Hadn't he lost his prime years as a fighter after he refused to fight in Vietnam? (\u201cI ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong,\u201d he explained.) Wasn't Foreman bigger, faster, stronger, younger? History records Ali's famous strategy, the \u201cRope-a-Dope\u201d defense, in which he simply outwaited Foreman, absorbing incalculable punishment until, in the eighth round, Foreman was exhausted and Ali exploded with a series of rights to the head, finishing him.\r\n\r\nWas this, however, really a strategy at all? \u201cWhen We Were Kings\u201d gives the impression that Ali got nowhere in the first round and adopted the Rope-a-Dope almost by default. Perhaps he knew, or hoped, that he was in better condition than Foreman, and could outlast him if he simply stayed on his feet. It is certain that hardly anyone in Zaire that night, not even his steadfast supporter Cosell, thought that Ali could win; the upset became an enduring part of his myth.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen We Were Kings\u201d captures Ali's public persona and private resolve. As heavyweight champion during the Vietnam War, he could easily have arrived at an accommodation with the military, touring bases in lieu of combat duty.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was called a coward and a draft dodger, surely it took more courage to follow the path he chose. And yet it is remarkable how ebullient, how joyful, he remained even after the price he paid; how he is willing to be a clown and a poet as well as a fighter and an activist.\r\n\r\nSeeing the film today inspires poignant feelings; we contrast younger Ali with the ailing and aging legend, and reflect that this fight must have contributed to the damage that slowed him down. It is also fascinating to contrast the young Foreman with today's much-loved figure; he, too, has grown and mellowed. When the movie was made all of those developments were still ahead; there is a palpable tension, as the two men step into the ring, that is not lessened because we know the outcome.",

He finds a willing backer in Mobutu Sese Suko, the dictator of Zaire, and the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" is set, including a musical festival featuring some of America's top black performers, like James Brown and B.B.

         "This is one of the most inspirational films I have seen in quite some time. I remember when this film was given the Academy award for best documentary, and hearing criticisms from some in the so-called \"liberal\" press (a reason to knock down this straw-man theory) that the film as undeserving of this title. Well after just seeing the film on video and reading some other comments from IMDB users claiming the same thing, I will have to outright disagree. The point of this film was not about the fight itself or George Forman, (yes he played a role) as some have argued it should have. It was about the symbolism that this fight possessed, especially revolving around Muhammad Ali' and the causes he fought for. Recently ESPN selected the top 100 Athletes of all time (well they should have said American Athletes, but that's our American arrogance for you) and Ali was picked third behind Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan. The definition of \"greatest athlete\" is ambiguous, but in my mind Ali, through this film and my recent is truly, \"The greatest\" as he so claimed. The film did an excellent job of getting as much footage as possible of all that occurred during the preparation that led to the fight and how it symbolized the joining of black people in America and Africa for a common cause in defeating their oppressors (US - white supremecy, and in Africa - European Colonialism). (which was clearly the main focus of the film) Yes, their were flaws in the film, and it was carried by the narration, Ali's unbelievably charismatic personality, and the numerous intelligent quotes that were made by him. But those that wish to criticize the \"music\" as they call it, clearly have NO UNDERSTANDING OF BLACK CULTURE. This film was a celebration of it, focusing on GREAT MUSICIANS such as James Brown and B.B. King. These artists represent a significant part of black American culture, and knowing how important it probably was to all of those black Americans to go to Africa to spite the white American culture (which wanted the fight there), which they felt used them, was something that was revolutionary. Before seeing this film I knew little about the \"Rumble in the Jungle,\" and little about Ali, but after seeing this film, I have come to realize that he really was \"the greatest.\" 9/10",
         "This is not a film without flaws. At certain points, I cringe at some of the implications, at the juxtaposition of images and thoughts. If this film were on a different topic, I would probably dislike it. That withstanding, it is a film about something so rare and exquisite, so moving, so profound: a hero. Muhammad Ali is the only man I can think of in the 20th Century deserving of this title. Just to look at him is to feel awe. His beauty, his conviction, his strength, his piety, all bound together in a contradictory but exquisite whole. Ali is a Whittman poem of flesh and blood. Shortcomings of this film aside, I can watch it again and again, and cry every time. And feel both shame and strength, and perhaps some hope, when confronted with Ali. If I ever have children, they will watch this film, if only because I can find nothing else that I can say stands for what I believe in.",
         "This film won a slew of critical praise (as well as quite a few awards) and it deserves all of them. Muhammad Ali is the most amazing athelete of the twentieth century and perhaps the most beloved boxer of all time. A public poll once showed that people all over the world recognized him more then the President of the United States. Maybe its because he is such an ill, tragic figure today that this film is so important because it shows him in all his glory when he was not just a magnificent boxer but a ringing voice of social conscience as well. This film shows him again in all his glory when he took on the seemingly invincible giant George Foreman. George is such a beloved figure now that people have forgotten that when he first won the Heavywieght Crown from Joe Frazier in 1973, that he was as dreaded and feared as Sonny Liston was in his heyday. Howard Cosell was one of Ali's most ardent supporters (he was one of the first to call him by that name and support him in his opposition of the draft) and yet even Cosell said that he didn't think that Ali could beat George Foreman. Ali had lost to Joe Frazier and Ken Norton and had barely won rematches with them, and Foreman knocked both of them silly in less then two rounds. Ali was almost 33 years old and considered all washed up and yet he showed no fear against this man. He told the public \"You think you were shocked when Nixon resigned, wait till I whip George Foreman's behind!!!\" This film brings that time and place in Zaire, Africa to life. Don King is a despicable character and yet he was a genius in promoting this fight in Africa. He said it was like from slaveship to championship. The symbolism was just tremendous. Norman Mailer and the late George Plimpton are two of the writers who most observed Ali and they both offer wonderful insights during the course of this film. They are especially good when they talk about the fight itself and how they both had a ringside seat. George Plimpton saw Bobby Kennedy shot and yet I don't think he was much more astounded when he saw what happened in that ring when Ali pulled off an amazing upset and knocked out Foreman to begin another glorious championship rein. It is almost comical when they show their shocked faces as Ali delivered the knockout blow. The best part of the film is where they play the song \"When We Were Kings\" at the end and show a montage of Ali's fights during his amazing career. You will look at these and realize how awesome this man truly was!!!",
         "First I must say that the editing is some of the best I have seen.WOW is the right world for this film.I have seen it four times and still I think it´s as interesting as the first time you see it.Muhammad Ali is really a genius and I think you will understand that when you see this film.The film is also very good because of people like Spike Lee,Malick Bowens and George Plimpton tells fascinating observations about the time. \"I'm young, I'm handsome, I'm fast, I'm pretty and can't possibly be beat\" This film really made me think and I would call it a masterpiece.You will also see great MUSICIANS such as B.B King,James Brown and the Spinners.I recommend this film to everybody,you don´t even need to like boxing to love this film.5/5",
         "It goes nearly without saying that Ali is a transcendent figure of his generation. For those currently in their twenties who did not grow up in Ali era, this film is a glimpse at why the world choked up upon seeing Ali light the flame at the Atlanta Olympiad. While Gast's footage of Ali in Kinshasa is sparse, interview segments with Plimpton, Mailer and Lee, and a pulsing soundtrack fill in the blanks to tell a surprisingly complete tale. The characters are fascinating: A young Don King, who had not yet made his name; a sullen, menacing George Foreman bearing no resemblance to the huckster we see today; the creepy Mobutu, who is rarely seen though his presence is felt, and Howard Cosell, who appears briefly to predict the defeat of the man who practically created him. Far, FAR superior to Michael Mann's Ali, which lifted huge pieces from this documentary. While Mann's film provides much more for the eye, Gast's \"Kings\" is a superior example of pure storytelling.",
         "I recall attending a closed circuit telecast of the Ali-Foreman fight in Miami in 1974, and when \"The Greatest\" actually pulled it off - regaining HIS title after the enforced exile - most of the audience went nuts. Rarely have I been in an environment of such absolute joy. This first class documentary leaves me wishing I had been in Zaire to experience that emotion \"live\". This is terrific film making about one of the most complicated and extraordinary heroes of the twentieth century and is richly deserving of the Academy Award which it received.",
         "To anyone born after Muhammad Ali's heyday as a boxer, it would be difficult to describe the impact he had on American life and culture. Sure, one can read about it and watch other documentaries, but there's something to be said about experiencing it in real time with Ali's name in the headlines, proclaiming himself to be The Greatest both in and out of the ring. \"When We Were Kings\" is probably an inappropriate title for this film, it plays more like \"When Ali Was King\", even though he wasn't World Champ at the time, having been stripped of the title for refusing the military draft. The picture does a credible job of presenting the behind the scenes machinations to bring the 'Rumble in the Jungle' to fruition, even with a six week delay due to a training injury suffered by Foreman. Thinking back to those days, I had never considered the implications of making the fight a black political statement, though in hindsight I would question allowing the involvement of a dictator like Mobutu Sese Seko putting up the money for the event. As described by Norman Mailer, one of the writers interviewed for the film, Mobutu was a closet sadist who rounded up a thousand criminals and put them in detention pens underneath the fight stadium to remove the threat of criminal activity while the eyes of the world were on his country. Don't expect to see a lot of the eight round fight in this documentary. What you need to know is capably explained by Mailer and fellow sportswriter George Plimpton laying out Ali's strategy and how he approached the fight. Mailer's analysis in particular is helpful in detailing how Ali's right hand leads so enraged Foreman that he used up a lot of his power and energy in trying to destroy him. Quite honestly though, I don't know quite what to make of the 'succubus' story that Plimpton seemed to be so fascinated with. Perhaps the most significant take away I had from the picture was hearing Spike Lee's comments that had nothing to do with the fight. He was speaking of black youth, but I would ascribe his remarks to all colors of a young generation today that remain completely unaware of history, and even worse, are disinterested in learning about it. Most certainly, Muhammad Ali would have something to say about that.",
         "I watched this movie last night on CBC, my third viewing. It keeps getting better. As fascinating a story as one would ever hope to see in any movie. In case anyone does not know why Muhammed Ali was widely named as the athlete of the century by many in 1999. This film will explain. Ironically, the long delay in finishing and releasing this film may have improved the finished product. The increased perspective of more than a decade may have sharpened the editing choices. Not a method I would recommend as it is rather hard on the artist, but we benefit in this case. It is important to recognize that whatever this film started out as, it became a study of Ali. And what a subject for study. What an athlete, what a man.",
         "The fight between Muhammad Ali aka Cassius Clay and George Foreman in Zaire. The fight was nicknamed the rumble in the jungle. The documentary follows Ali and Foreman. It also has insight from writers and witnesses, Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, and African American film director, Spike Lee, who later directed the film, \"Ali.\" This documentary is a rare treasure that captures history, culture, and relationships. Ali is the underdog in the ring against Foreman on October 30, 1974. The outcome is remarkable as is the story behind both fighters. Ali is proud of being an African American, honest, opinionated, and vocal about civil rights in America and in Africa. He was proud to see Africans who flew, lived, and governed their own country. Sadly, Ali isn't well with Parkinsons. The disease has crippled his voice but not his message in recent years. The documentary is historical for so many reasons.",
         "This is the Oscar winning documentary about the legendary boxing bout between Muhammad Ali, the challenger and George Foreman, who was the reigning world heavy weight boxing champion of the time. The match became popular as \"Rumble in the Jungle\". it was held at Kinshasa, Zaire. Both the fighters were blacks. However, Ali was revered as a demi-God because he had spoken about the atrocities which the African Americans were facing in the US and had refused to go and fight in Vietnam. He was considered a true representative of the blacks. George Foreman, as the documentary says, was \"blacker than Ali\". But still he was taken as the white devil incarnate. The match was promoted by Don King. the President of Zaire decided to give the financial rewards to the fighters as he planned to use the bout to promote his country and his despotic rule. the build up to the fight and then the fight itself have been captured perfectly. there are glimpses about Ali's interaction with the citizens of Zaire who constantly urge him to \"Ali, Boma Ye\" which means \"Ali, Kill Him\". The movie is very gripping and shows the human face of the Gods of the Gloves. Two thumbs up."
