         "Some people claim this is a bad movie... true. Some people claim this movie is a bad translation of the video game it's supposed to be based on... true. Some people claim it's the worst ever... trust me, I've seen worse. While it does have its Christmas list of bad things (poor script, ugly sets, subpar acting), it's good for a laugh or two because of the negatives... at the same time however, any dedicated fan of the Street Fighter games will find this as an insult because it does not properly adapt the video game... Is it a bad movie? Sure it is... but I've seen my share of bad movies and I can tell that this isn't the absolute worst!",
         "As a huge fan of the video game that is the basis for this movie, I felt compelled to watch it even though I have never been much of a Van Damme fan. To my surprise, I found this film to be a lot of fun. By action movie standards, the silly one-liners work pretty well, and it was fun to see the video game characters come to life, even if they did make a few changes to the basic plot of the game. All things considered, I'm glad I took the time to watch \"Street Fighter\". It's nothing memorable, but if you're in the mood to watch some silly action fluff, then I'd say that it's time well wasted.",
         "Street Fighter is a strange video game movie. The game is an amazing 2D fighter with a wide array of characters from different continents who battle it out for...something. The Movie, surprisingly, has more plot than you would think. M. Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) is now portrayed as a megalomanical super villain who has dreams of causing collapse to the entire world, such as killing a large number of hostages unless paid a ransom worthy of Dr. Evil standards, creating a breed of super soldiers and kidnapping the Queen of England and create his own world based off of his image. Trust me, it is as silly as it sounds. Lt. Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) approaches the situation in that he has to save the hostages and hopefully put Bison on ice, once and for all, thus stopping his plans for world domination. From there on in, the movie is basically an almost two hour fan service with various subplots with almost all the characters from the Street Fighter universe. Zangief and Dee Jay work for M. Bison as Muscle and Computer Technician, respectively. Chun-Li, Balrog and E. Honda are all out for get revenge and Ken and Ryu are professional fighters hoping to score a battle against the vain Vega and evil Sagat. Like I said, the rest of the movie is nothing short of fan service, since all the actors deliver some truly awful one liners aside, Van Damme's Guile almost sounds like Tommy Wiseau (\"The Room\") when you close your eyes, and the whole plot itself is actually quite boring. Well, why in the world would someone defend this movie then? I'll give you three reasons, two are part of the movie, and one is a personal thing. 1. Raul Julia's M. Bison. A villain who looks rather powerful should be given a great performance. While Raul Julia did die after this movie was over, there is no denying that he went out with a bang rather than whimper. His performance is laughably over the top, but at no point do you look at his face and see a man who seems to think he's in a movie, and as a result, he makes the movie quite amazing. If anything, he gives us a theatrical villain which, for his character, works very well. 2. There was a lot of room for potential here. Let's be honest, writing a movie is easy, but writing a good movie is hard. The director (Who is also the writer) took a fighting video game and crafted a movie out of it, and a fairly well done one at that. Sure, not in execution, but in originality, it works. 3. It was a movie from my childhood. I was a child of the 90's, and as such, I can remember my parents letting me watch this at a very young age, and it was awesome. Damn the Nostalgia factor, but it's what makes this movie really good. I can remember how intimidated I was in the final battle scenes, and how cool M. Bison was to me (in that over the top Saturday Morning Cartoon style of cool). This movie is a very easy one to attack for just not being good, but understand from my point of view, even knowing how bad it is, having no character development, some truly cheesy one liners and awful performances, including Van Damme giving a performance that makes him sound like Tommy Wiseau if he smoked cigarettes for ten years and you closed your eyes real tight, I still like it. It's cheesy, terrible and ridiculous, but all you need to know is that Raul Julia delivers some of the best lines for years to come, and you know you are dealing with a kind of cult classic when one of the film's greatest lines is, \"This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely, you've heard of it.\" In other words, go see this movie if you haven't already. 7/10.",
         "(WANING SPOILERS!!!!!!) I don't know why people think this is a bad movie when actually it's not. It's story of Bison holding hostages for a ransom is not parallel to the Video Game's Story but that is something M. Bison would do. Also most of the characters did look like themselves or at least tried to (Ken was the only who didn't). The Humor by Dee Jay and Zangief was too good ZANGEIF: QUICK CHANGE THE CHANNEL! Captain Sawawda was an also welcomed addition to the Street Fighter franchise and I someday hope to see him in another SF related project. The acting was great and the action was unparalleled. My only complaint is they could have tried harder with the special moves. Other than that this was an awesome experience. 10/10",
         "It's really dangerous to make a movie out of a video game, especially when the characters in the video game are cartoony. STREET FIGHTER is a terrible movie. The characters are a joke, and ACT like it's all a joke. The movie looks cheesy (study Bison's \"hovering\" command pod - it's obviously hooked to some kind of crane), and committing the famous Street Fighter martial arts movies into live action just looks stupid. What do you expect from DeSouza when the only things he directed before were a \"Tales From The Crypt\" episode and some shows of \"Bowling For Dollars\"? (No joke) Even the few Van Damme fans that are still left (after he's made countless bombs like this) will be embarrassed for their onscreen hero.",
         "Okay, so not all of my family agrees on the movie. But, I enjoyed it from the first time I saw it on T.V. The two main actors, Raul Julia and Jean-Claude Van Damme portray their characters well, though Kylie Monigue turned me off her character a little. Be in mind that being based on a video game it can not be perfected to follow the games exactly. In general the movie is centred around two forces based in Shadaloo, where A.N. (Allied Nation) hostages are taken by General M. Bison (Raul Julia) and unless is demands are met, he'll kill every single hostage is has. It is up to the U.N. leader, military commanding officer Colonel William F. Guile and his army to rescue them. They are joined along the way, under unfortunate circumstances, by a ninja journalist Chun-Li Zang (the voice of Mulan) her two friends a former sumo-wrestler E. Honda (Peter Navy Tuiasosopo) and former boxer Balrog (Grand L. Bush) as well as two thieves, Ryu Hoshi (Bryon Mann) and Ken Masters (Damian Chapa). A good enjoyable movie with some light class actors and a well thought out plot . Okay so not every person in the world will love this, but when you want something for a rainy day (like it is out here) then this is the type of movie I'd recommend. Overall I gave it 10/10 because not only is Jean-Claude Van Damme one of my favourite actors, everyone of his movies entertains me greatly, not to mention the awesome fighting scenes. For fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme who have not seen many of his movies I recommend that you see The Replicant, Timecop and maybe Universal Soldier (if you don't mind a little bit of a corny actors based around him).",
         "I really don't see why most everyone has a problem with this movie. The storyline is solid, and is, contrary to what most people believe, somewhat true to the story. Like it or not, Guile and Chun-Li are meant to be the main characters in SF2 and the movie reflects this. In the games, their endings are directly tied to Bison. Of the remaining 14 characters (obviously not counting Bison,) only one other is: Cammy's, and that's only because Bison tells her about her amnesia. As for the casting, it was very well done. The only problems I saw/heard are Van-Damme's French accent, Dhalsim's casting as a doctor, which WAS well done despite being unfaithful to the game, T. Hawk's lack of height (I think Rainwater is shorter than Van-Damme) and Chapa's short hair. Otherwise, everything else was spot-on, especially the casting for Bison. Raul Julia is the only person that I think could've done it. He's a fairly versatile actor AND he looks like Bison. A couple other characters were miscasted like Dhalsim, but the excellent acting made up for that. The combination of Charlie and Blanka was both acceptable and unacceptable. How? Street Fighter Alpha didn't come out until a year after this film did, but both Blanka's and Guile's endings disprove the combination. Getting back to the story, it was actually believable for not being based around a tournament like SF2 is. Being forced into a three day timetable by Bison's ransom demands made the movie seem all the more action-packed, to me at least. The scene between Bison and Chun-Li in Bison's quarters could've been cut out, though, except for the part where Bison was about to get his butt kicked by Chun-Li. The final battle between Bison and Guile was the most blatantly choreographed yet still exciting thing I had ever seen in a martial arts movie up to that point, other than the odd scene from a few Jackie Chan movies. The sound was pretty horrible. Generic rap somehow found its way into the movie in the cage fighting arena scene, and I swear I heard it again when I played the god-awful SF3: Third Strike. That one should've been permanently shelved. The orchestrated music that made it into the movie was nearly impossible to hear, although some of it was vaguely reminiscent of Guile's stage in SF2. The worst part was the lack of music from the game. A symphony orchestra doing all the music from the characters that made it into the movie (so no Fei-Long or Akuma) would've been great. So would have the Amiga CD32 version of Super Turbo if it was out or the arcade version of Super. Many of the characters signature moves are not present. I counted one Hadouken (to Vega in the Ryu+Ken vs. Vega+Sagat fight in Bison's quarters, very easy to miss as it's done at point-blank range,) a few flash kicks (minus the special effect,) and one Psycho Crusher (I think that's the name.) No Sonic Boom, no Shoryuken, no anything else. Overall, there are a few glaring issues (sound and lack of special moves mostly,) but it's still very enjoyable. 7/10 Recommended to: Martial arts fans Van-Damme fans Street Fighter fans Not Recommended to: Street Fighter fans who believe Ryu and Ken are supposed to be the main characters without realizing only three endings out of sixteen people (not counting Bison and including Akuma) are actually tied to Bison himself.",
         "Shortly after the beginning of the disastrous Street Fighter movie, we see the words \"Based on the Capcom game Street Fighter\" displayed. How ironic, then, that the movie following is anything but. For a movie that purports to be based on one of the most well-known arcade games of all time, the Street Fighter movie does not so much tell the story of the game as it does rape, butcher, and mangle it into an unrecognizable form. The Mortal Kombat adaptation, while certainly not being a cinematic masterpiece, at least stayed relatively faithful to the games. Somewhere along the line in this parade of broken lives and shattered dreams, someone decided that the tournament-based, Enter the Dragon-like storyline of the game would never fly with the American movie-going public. And so it was rewritten, becoming a typical American action flick, with plenty of huge explosions, loud gunfights, and thinly veiled right-wing propaganda. A Japanese protagonist? That will never do. Why not cast the Belgian Jean Claude Van Damme as the American Guile, and have him become the main character? It's not as if fans of the game are going to mind, are they? Street Fighter the movie is a catastrophe. Every character, bar none, from the games is butchered and rewritten beyond recognition. Chun Li, played perhaps the only well-casted actor in this dreck, Ming Na Wen, has become a mere reporter (with a smirking Balrog and a Hawaiian shirted E. Honda as her camera crew, natch) instead of a detective, Ryu and Ken are incompetent gun smugglers, and Jimmy/Blanka and Charles/Nash become the same person in one of the most laughably absurd plot contrivances ever thought up. There are so many incongruities between this movie and the game that it becomes difficult to tell if they are merely the result of the incompetence of the writers, or their actual intent. For example, were the writers (whom I hope are begging for change at bus stop right about now) aware that \"Shadaloo\" was merely the name of M. Bison's organization, and not the name of a fictitious South Asian country? (which conveniently rests atop present-day Myanmar?) Or were they simply not paying close enough attention to the game's storyline? Who knows? Consider the most egregious example of the screenwriters' disdain for the source material: M. Bison walks into his laboratory and addresses one of the scientists there as \"Doctor Dhalsim.\" Was Dhalsim a doctor in the game? Do we ever see him fight in this movie? Do we ever see him using his remarkably elastic limbs? The answer to all these questions, of course, is no. The writer's simply drop in a character named \"Dhalsim\" just for the sake of saying they included him. The movie's failing is in its desperation to include every single character to the detriment of the rest of the film. I can only imagine what Akuma would have looked like had the writers decided to include him. Anyone who played through Street Fighter knows that each character had at least one defining personality trait. Ryu was the stoic martial artist seeking to become a true warrior, his friend Ken was brash and arrogant, Vega was obsessed with beauty, Sagat wanted revenge on Ryu for scarring his chest, etc. It should come as no surprise that none of these traits appear in any shape, form or fashion in this movie, and in the rare moment that a character DOES act like their game counterpart, it's more often the result some sort of lame contrivance than a scripted personality trait. Chun Li's cameraman Balrog only happens to box. When Ryu and Ken and \"inducted\" into M. Bison's army, the uniforms they wear just happen to resemble the white and red karate gis they wore in the game. To top it all off, M. Bison gives a lengthy explanation of how his \"magnetic levitation\" that allows him to perform the movie's equivalent of the Psycho Crusher. It's as if the screenwriters set out to make a completely different movie, and were only told halfway through that it was supposed to be a Street Fighter movie. Which brings me to my next point; there's little actual \"street fighting\", giving fans of the games precious little to chew on through the movie's running length. Whatever fight scenes we get are brief and unexciting, and are nothing next to other martial arts movies. Instead we get Jean Claude Van Damme running from scene to scene, spewing out pithy one-liner after one-liner, gleefully trampling any remaining source material that hasn't already been butchered. Only Raul Julia and Ming Na Wen come through with any dignity left; they apparently realized what a turkey this film was and at least tried to have some fun with their roles. Their noble efforts, however, are sunk by the awful screenplay, which should be an example to future filmmakers of how NOT to adapt a video game to the big screen. As an aside note, there was actually an arcade game made of this movie. Yes, it was terrible, too.",
         "This movie is so awful that it's great. Where to begin... well, JCVD is great as always. Also, Kylie Minogue is in the movie, that's kind of strange. This site left out the BEST quote of the entire movie. Anyone who is familiar with Street Fighter the game will know that Sagat has an eye-patch. At one point in the movie, it is discovered that Ken and Ryu are spies for the AN (the good guys). They are spying on Sagat and M. Bison. When this is discovered, M. Bison turns to Sagat, covers one eye with his hand, and says \"I guess you didn't see that.\" The first time I saw this movie, I damn near died laughing at this. The delivery, everything is just so RIGHT ON. So, yeah. I say check it out. If nothing else, you'll get a few cheap laughs out of it.",
         "I have always been a huge fan of the Street Fighter series in video games. So when this movie came out I was really excited, of course I was way too young to appreciate a movie, but I can tell that back then I thought it was horrible. A few years ago it was aired on TV and (I don't why) I saw it again. And I found it kind of funny. The story is all twisted if it gets compared with the video games story; I mean, in the video game, Ryu is the most important character and in the movie it is hardly seen. Cammy is a creation of Bison (in the video game), so she is part of the bad guys, while in the movie she is friend of Guile. A lot of intentional mistakes were made in order to transform what could be a good story into a useless-action-movie. I hoped to see hadoukens and spinning kicks when I first saw the movie, but there is nothing of that. In other words, the movie sucks. PS: Kylie Minogue, who played Cammy in the movie, declared later that she was completely sorry of shooting such a bad movie."
